Choosing to Change for Progress
On May 25, 2014 choose between the PS model and the N-VA model. And that is a historic
choice. For the past 25 years our country was blocked. Instead of a social policy,
was a socialist policy.
With all its consequences. Year after year increase in public spending. Play again and again
the increased taxes. There is barely reformed and debts keep piling up.
Today are flashing all alarms. Companies move away, jobs are lost,
people find it harder to buy a home, start a family, accounts for
pay. At the same time our social system is under severe pressure. Fewer and fewer people wear
led by, while costs continue to rise ankle. We want our pensions, health care
and keeping benefits affordable, we must now reform quickly.
And that means making choices. Courageous choices that can not be made for 25 years, under
more because Flemings and francophones have opposing views. The N-VA wants and dares
who do make the necessary choices. Because we can not accept that our children
and grandchildren will have it worse. Because someone has your welfare and prosperity
protect.
The N-VA stands for a different policy. A policy for those who work, save and undertake. A
policies that reward responsibility and cares for those who really need it. A
policy that lowers taxes, finally, dismantle our public debt and the government thoroughly
dieting move. So we re-create space for entrepreneurship and for genuine social policy.
Such a major overhaul is not sustainable unless you also anchored in a new
state structure. Therefore, we must make the transition to the confederation. That will take time
require not happen overnight. But just so we can get the Flemings
policies that guarantee them for years to vote and where they will be entitled to have.
In this brochure we present you the N-VA model, which we our country as soon as possible
want to get back on track. In this way we make our choice. A choice for Change
for Progress.
On May 25 it's up to you.

1.6. BILLS ON ORDER
Since 2008, we have been
faced with the consequences of the
global financial and economic
crisis. The government revenue
decreased, increased its spending,
budget deficits were larger, the
debt increased.
The European Union gave us land
a clear mission: Set
in order to save on business
on government spending,
funding to reduce
and reducing our indebtedness.
The Flemish Government has its
done homework for the fourth year
consecutive balanced budget. The
Federal Government grossly lap
deficit. Less than a third of the way
is made to the balance. The
budget deficit fell below the
Di Rupo government of 3.7% of the

GDP at the end of 2011 to only 2.7% in
2014 (European Commission forecast).
The deficit is thus considerably higher than
was initially agreed with Europe and
as usual scenario again
increase.
The federal budget deficit slightly
lowering and meanwhile the expenditure
nevertheless let rise: it could only by
increase revenue. Below
Di Rupo increased government spending
to 54% of GDP, a historical
record. The rehabilitation of 23 billion euros
which Di Rupo put in perception,
turns out to be pure fiction. Di Rupo showed
a pertinent lack of real
savings and unlimited
creativity in the search for
new taxes.
CD & V and Open VLD never declared
to a government that will step in
workers, savers and entrepreneurs
would burden. They stepped into the regeringDi Rupo and then whosoever
works, saves, and yet undertake additional
taxed. The consequences are dramatic.
Per day over 30 companies go bankrupt.
Since Di Rupo we count more than
25 000 bankruptcies. More than 400,000
people are without work.
Since 2008 the public debt
re-soared.
The high debt level makes us
vulnerable to the stresses
financial markets. Added to this
Belgium Dexia via guarantees
guarantees more than 10% of
GDP. As a result, the
remaining financial space over time

very limited. And then there's the
budgetary impact of aging.
Headed by Minister Muyters
the Flemish Government has managed
managed its budget again
to balance, and that
to consolidate balance. By
The continuing turbulence in the
financial markets and the sluggish
Economic growth was that no
sinecure.
With the rapid and thorough decontamination

student budget, but unfortunately
in Belgium the good pupil rarely
rewarded. The federal government parties
have the constitutional reform
abused the next Flemish
Government to saddle with
bill of 1.8 billion euros in 2016.
A bill even higher rises on
long term (by 2019 is already 2.1
billion).
The high bill is partly due
of the fact that not all the resources
be transferred to the new
finance responsibilities.
For good measure explains the new
Finance the growth of
resources severely restricted. She goes
taking out of unrealistic
hypotheses about the evolution of the
personal income. Flanders will

contributions to pensions and must
thereby pay, but not control.

space for necessary investment
in our care, our education and our
infrastructure. The first will now

reign again marked
stand by what Di Rupo not
did: remediation.

1.6.1. Vision
The finances are the alpha and the omega
public policy at every level,
from municipality to European Union. The
taxes, charges and levies
a government collects, determine how much they
can spend for its policies.
Public finance there is a
triple 'golden rule':
1. G

enters. Thus ensures
a balanced budget, as
we do not build up debt
which future generations
must pay off and we do
not paying unnecessary interest.
2. L? eg citizens and
companies no longer

required. So make informed
and thoughtful policy choices
and sparingly, especially in the
own operation.
3. H

Some owed their
taxes not paid or
public money (benefits,
30 / subsidies, ...) get where they
are not entitled to.
The N-VA wants the accounts in order
get. In recent years came Belgium
the agreements with Europe, not after. There
must change. With a
balanced budget we create
space to implement new policies and
we reduce our debt.
In view of the height of the
government spending (54%) want the N-VA which
the government mainly to save themselves.
The government will work with fewer resources

realization (see Chapter 3).
The overall tax burden has already
long crossed the pain threshold
and must fall, because today is who
works undertaken, save or invest
invariably doomed. The N-VA wants a
an unambiguous and simple fiscal
regulations, strictly enforced
becomes. The simpler the rules,
the less control is required on the
application of it, and the less
tax evasion or money
evasion is lost.
Fraud and misuse of
our social and fiscal regulations
do harm to people
The regulations have met correctly. She
are also harmful to our economy
and for the competitiveness of
our companies, because that hit
working conditions and social
protection of workers
eroded. They also undermine the
support for solidarity among citizens
and businesses. The attack on the
solidarity and tax fraud must
with the same structural strength
be addressed.
1.6.2. Change for

policy areas (such as

government seizure of 54% and a
still rising expenses rhythm,
there is enough space for it.
Prove that the figures in the

Change for Progress TOGETHERNESS STRENGTHEN
People are dependent on one another.
In living with others
we are fully human. Freedom and
responsibility are the
foundations. Freedom gives everyone
the opportunity to put themselves in our society
maximum to develop and
unfold. Asks responsibility
of everyone in our society
participate and to commit themselves.
A society can not survive
without solidarity, commitment
and cohesion. Globalization,

strengthen togetherness.
Togetherness gets first
Instead stature in the family, in which
composition too. Strong and warm
families in which people together
take responsibility and love
and find mutual support, forming
the foundation of our society. The
upbringing of children in the family
start, continuation and supplement gets into
education. Together with the parents
gives the school values,
knowledge and expertise through. Sound
Education is also feeding ground
of our social fabric and switch on
our future.
Solidarity and involvement
are found among groups that
we can identify where
we feel 'at home' feel, security
and find recognition. The 6.5 million
Flemings constitute such a group.
Flanders is their significant
community. Therefore, it is
important and necessary in the
community everybody as equals
is given equal opportunities and
then also intervenes.
A closely knit Flemish
community is a community
where everyone belongs, people
with and without migration background.
The 15 percent of Flemish people who are not here
born or whose parents or
grandparents were not born here,
should have the same opportunities and rights
get as native Flemings.
Of course, also apply to them,
the same duties and expectations,

Without volunteers there would be no culture

2.1. STRONG FAMILIES, STRONG
SCHOOLS
The family is the cornerstone of our
society and therefore deserves
special attention. The family in all
its forms and diversity. The
time in which a family consisted of a
working man, a housewife and their
kids behind us. More and more
dual earner model is the norm.
Combine family and work demands
sometimes strenuous efforts of parents.
The government should support them
to relieve those efforts.
The need for adequate, affordable
and accessible childcare, both
pre-school and outside school, is
For example, large and cries out
additional investments. While
Flanders extra previous years
invested in family policy and
20 500 additional places created in

2.1.1. The family as the cornerstone of
our society
2.1.1.1. Vision
Choosing a family in whatever form
also, is a personal choice

consequences. Family policy

Child benefit as a right for every child? Family benefits are a right
of each child. The central
starting point is the position of the
child and not the socio-professional
situation of the parents. ? All children in Flanders
live and who are in the same
situation must be equal

existing systems together into one
system. Similar flat

MODEL

was and is so on the approach of the
financial and economic crisis, the
judicial reform, the
migration and asylum policy, on social
security - and so on. The
opposing views, insights
and preferences run through all about
policy.
From two completely different
principles can never be a
uniform and effective solution
arise. There can only be a
solution arise either one
part of the country or one like it. A
solution therefore is no solution.
A solution in which everyone loses.
That is the price that Flemings and
Francophones pay for the current
system. They do not get policy
what they are voting. They get
a policy that continues to muddle
and does not succeed in much-needed
structural reforms through
perform. Structural change is just
possible as we have our own problems
can deal with our own
solutions and our own money, and
on their own responsibility.
Consecutive state reforms
have sought democratic
price tag to mitigate. They resulted
in an unfathomable federal
state planning. The powers of
the federation, the Communities and
the regions are still not logical
demarcated. The citizen gets lost
and do not get what he deserves.
The clash of visions between Flemings and
Francophones and the unwillingness / inability to

us with a tax burden,
labor costs and public spending
which are among the highest in the world
properly and still rising. The
public debt is so high that the interest

Budgetary gasps and
consequently not 'just' policy
are used.
Another pain point is the way in which
Solidarity today organized
is in Belgium, the transfers
Flanders to Wallonia and Brussels.
The amount is increased to
eight billion - a sum that does not
is more reasonable to call, especially
because of the perverse effects of
called solidarity. The transfers
does not turn on until all
better policy or accountability,
but confirm the dependence of
Wallonia and Brussels.
The sixth state reform matched the
derailed solidarity mechanism
of the Special Financing
to. But in combination with other
elements will even transfers
increase. Moreover,
even after the sixth state reform
still little in house
accountability of the federal states.

3.1.1. Vision

Francophones different paths

waste in Community
discussions. This country has change
required. No state reform as
the six preceding, wherein the

In the short term we can stir in

But we want something structurally
change, then we have the
change structures. How come
can, the N-VA has at its congress
Change for Progress
of 31 January, 1 and February 2, 2014
demonstrated. There we have it
mapped path that leads to the
Confederation Belgium.
The Confederation consists of Belgium
Lander Flanders and Wallonia, which
own all powers.
They can be engaged in itself, or
decide to certain powers
together to bear on the
confederal level. In the Confederation
, the Brussels-Capital region
and the German-speaking region a particularly
status. The Region of Brussels-Capital
is accountable and get
land-based powers
assigned. At the same time in Brussels

the link with Flanders and
Wallonia cited and practice
Lander is the personal
powers.
Our confederal project run
we have the logic of the past six
state reforms. Instead of
powers to be transferred from
the federal level to Flanders
and Wallonia, can competence
are transferred from the
Länder to the confederal level.
Voluntary cooperation works
better than forced collaboration.
This is evident from the matters which
the Flemish and the Walloon authorities
today already directly with each other
consult and to good agreements
come. Should be like. Tear down

down.
Confederalism ensures a
slim and transparent government that
efficient - and therefore cheaper - works
with institutions that are prepared together
to work instead of against each other to
work.
So we set Flemings and
Francophones in each state to their fate
into their own hands. Each can
according to their own views, own
responsibility, and with their own
pennies make the change
they need each believe.

N-VA reached out to the
other Parties and twenty proposals
put on the table to get a breath of fresh air
to let the political blow. Unfortunately
the other parties were not there
entered. Many of our proposals
remain valid.
3.2.2.2. Change for
Progress
? We abolish the Senate without
off more. Its added value
"Reflection room" was already limited,
The sixth state reform has
that function completely eroded.
Its cost / benefit ratio
was already warped, after the
sixth state reform roads
costs less than ever

the abolition let

? Let the parliamentary working year
We begin on September 1st. The
far too long summer break state
decent parliamentary work
the continuous monitoring of the
government in the way.
? The retirement compensation

we switch similar to that of
the Flemish Parliament (a
pedestal of five months, and one

month per year with a mandate
maximum of 24 months).
? A minister must be no

is compromised and / or
public confidence in
the office becomes compromised,

affected or conflict between
conflict of interest arises.
Such ethics
rule already exists in Flanders
and also at the federal level must
level can be entered.
? In line with the European
rules for Commissioners,
allowed a minister to a number
months after his no mandate
some function in business
recording, at least in the areas of
which she as minister
were. Current regulations
is too narrow and excludes some
abuse does not matter.
? The Federal Ethics

initiative or that of a
Third, not only on demand
the agent itself. Her
advice should public
be made to ensure compliance
of ethical rules to off

can intervene effectively when
a representative of the deontological
violating rules.

? The voting is compulsory (compulsory voting)
we abolish. The voter
has to be free to choose whether or not
his democratic right to vote
to practice. The government and the
political parties should citizens
urge their elections
votes cast. Suffrage
instead of forcing compulsory voting
politicians to in some other way
doing politics. The security
that everyone should vote,
politicians do too much on their
rest laurels. In countries without
stemplicht give attendance figures
an important indication about
the political health
climate.
? We let the cost of
the election
Calculating by the Court. That
will oblige the parties
their programs as concrete and
to make realistic as possible.
? We know the Flemings in the
abroad, voting rights to
for the election of the
Flemish Parliament. Now they can
only the elections
participate.
? The federal and constituent states
elections, let's not
coincide. Coinciding
Elections are contrary complete
against the autonomy
Flanders has acquired.
In no federal land
are the federal and
state elections on the same

day held. Every policy
must separately on its own merits,
can be assessed.
? The monarchy is a
outdated form of government, the
birthright is not consistent with the
basic democratic principles.
In the transition phase to the
introduction of republican
form of government, we are the
Belgian monarchy to
a ceremonial monarchy.
No more political missions;
no countersignature;
no formation tasks; no
foreign missions without
agreement of the states; no
pardons; No new
noble titles; no military
functions ... Only the head of state
and his or her spouse (o) t (e)
bear the title of king and
queen. The Cabinet of the
King comes, as in the Netherlands,
be under political control.
? For the sake of the quality of the
regulatory and publicity
of directors, we make the
Opinions of the State Council
public, so that citizens and
government may note
hold.
? We have the Council of State
also give advice on
constitutional changes. It is standing

On the contrary. Collaboration

To achieve all that, should

and reduce their overhead,
including through a thorough

Until the efficiency exercise is a

Correct application of the
subsidiarity? Member States are only

see value in. In every
case, legislation and policy
as close to the citizen
will be made and carried out. ? The subsidiarity should be a

national and / or regional
Parliaments argues that policy

level is then issued
at European level, should

withdraw. ? The 'yellow and orange kaart'procedures should be
improved. According to this
procedures, the national
parliaments, the Commission
send motivated advice
in which they explain
why a particular European
Bill is contrary to
subsidiarity.
We provide in a better
support national
parliaments to control this task
to carry out, with more time and
resources and with criteria
they can be used in the
reasons for their decision.
More transparency? Contacts between the EU and
civil organizations,
NGOs, businesses, trade and
professional associations, trade unions,
think tanks, useful and ...
possible when they fully
transparent and within the limits
of the law and ethical principles

Stronger economic governance with
fiscal and banking union? Agreed rules
be effectively and strictly
used to produce the mutual
trust between Member States
not to harm. Also, for the
credibility of the EU itself
it is important for Member States
which do not comply with the
agreed rules to force
responsibility. ? A common

in the form of Eurobonds,

On the contrary. It is just

This should enable future
generations to pay for the

European approach. A European

price stability is the main objective.
In addition, Member States

banking union supposes,

The European risk sharing
must be the result of a
stepwise process, starting
with a functioning
European banking supervision,
then harmonized

settlement frameworks and
comparable financial starting position
of the participating banks. Only
if these conditions are met,

be imagined. Are thereby
two additional conditions

and least of all at the expense of the
past (legacy cost '). On the other hand
all creditors must first

before the taxpayer
bear the cost. For the
depositors this obviously applies
only for the amounts above
deposit guarantee.
The promotion of more business,
prosperity and jobs? The European Union must contribute
the prosperity which the
welfare can be built.
Undeniably, the internal
market, one of the greatest
strengths of the EU. The macroeconomic benefits of this
market, covering more than 500 million
citizens achieved in the 28 Member States,
are particularly large. Also for
