2.4 The policy of privatization and capital favoring

reflections of the financial crises of the imperialist countries; in
short the further deterioration of the living conditions of the masses,

imperialism.

1.1 For a revolutionary party, elections are not
an end in itself, but one of the many (and not the most
important) land struggle in which the party intervenes to
to defend the independence of the working class in the face of
bourgeoisie and their candidates.
1.2 The PCO elections are a tribune (more

for PCO elections are a secondary ground Fight
working class and the exploited, which can only win
their claims through its organization and
revolutionary mobilization.
1.4 The Workers' Cause Party, however, understands
the political participation of the working class is a condition
essential to their victory over the ruling classes and
struggle for socialism and that in this sense, the political intervention
independent in the elections with a socialist program and
struggle for self-government of the working class is
essential. That is why the PCO appears to have elections
as a central theme the defense of the Revolution, Government
Labor and Socialism.
1.5 Abstentions in the current electoral process would amount to
abandon the struggle to boot the working class of influence
nefarious of class collaboration policy and overcome
their illusions in the parliamentary mechanism.

2. Elections in advance frame
the capitalist crisis and the crisis regime
2.1 The Brazilian electoral process takes place amid a
colossal deterioration of the historic crisis of capitalism (which
marks its exhaustion), whose current stage is reopened
fully after the collapse of the US subprime in
2008.
2.2 We are experiencing the collapse of so-called

distributed to banks and other leeches.
2.10 The advance of capitalist crisis (from 2008) led
to a crisis of these consensual relations between imperialism
and the governments of the national bourgeoisie, leading to a
intensification of the conflict of interests between the different
factions of the Brazilian bourgeoisie, already announced in
Lula's second term.
2:11 The case of the "monthly allowance", which appears in the first

3. June 2013: reaction to repression
the PSDB and coup right right
3.1 The election campaign begins one year after the
closing the biggest wave of popular protests of
past two decades. Faced with the violent police crackdown on
demonstration in SÃ£o Paulo on June 13, 2013 (which
was repeated to a lesser extent in Rio de Janeiro and Belo
Horizon) burst into a massive popular massive protest
against the right of governments dominating the top three states

struggle of the workers (metallurgical SJC) and defeating
their mobilization (as in the subway).
5.4 Sower of electoral illusions, this left
petty bourgeois imposes increasingly a policy of
subordination of the real struggles of workers to the dispute
parliamentary positions (acting this way against against
workers' party)
5.5 His electoral front of leftist politics, whose only
real purpose is to get electoral dividends (as evidenced
in all previous experiences with applications

for any class independence perspective and are
totally trailer and the service of politics variants

construction of a workers' party and the masses and the struggle for

Football, preceded by a huge right Campaign
national and international (supported once again by sectors
petty bourgeois left) against its execution, with
clear intention of obtaining electoral dividends against the PT and in favor

4.1 Showing a high degree of political maturity,
overwhelming majority of the working population (which is not
represented by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois crowd
present in stadiums) rejected that real political

4.2 The campaign against imperialism Cup (which

people, when they have not meet or 0.5% of

manipulation by the left of the sectors

right, deep enemy of the people and its manifestations

when they offer them some kind of profit or advantage).
For them no right people to the party, is not entitled to
fraternization. Only to work and oppression by gang
capitalist. Twist against Brazil (not only against the team
Brazilian) because they want to use a possible reduction of the people,
to promote the implementation of its policy of "austerity"
ie the expropriation of the majority in favor of banks and
the big monopolies that every day are stealing
often more than certainly it was (and is being)
subtracted from people with business Cup.
4.3 socialist and revolutionary struggle in order
conscious - in all trenches - in defending
interests of the majority (the working class and other exploited)
against the minority (the parasitic bourgeoisie and leech
who lives at the expense of the misery and suffering of the vast majority
of population). The defense of popular culture, the festivals, the
the sports people etc. against attacks and strokes of
capitalists and its most reactionary wing, imperialism
world, are part of this class struggle, irreconcilable.
Faced with this situation, we stand together in class
working and the vast majority of the Brazilian exploited people,
cheering for Brazil, also as part of the struggle for defeat
the right and imperialism.

6. For a fighting program
working class of the city and
field
6.1 The central task of the present moment is the struggle for
political independence of workers in relation to all
variants of bourgeois politics. This fight involves the defense,
in this election against bourgeois and pequenoburgueses candidates, representative of the socialist candidates

youth, women and blacks.
6.2 The basis for this is the program governments

7.2 The Constitution of 88, rather than preaches

was no more than the "democratic" solution found by
State dominated by the military and the politicians of old
dictatorship to seek to stabilize the political system and exhausted
harassed by the working mobilization.
7.3 The 1988 Constitution has served to rebuild the
anti-democratic aspects of the military regime placed below
the mobilization of the masses.
7.4 Besides leaving the door open for intervention

to a new anti-strike law and a set of

5.1 Without having an independent policy in the face of crisis,
petty bourgeois left supports the fundamental policy
coup of pro-imperialist right against the front of the government
popular and anti-worker, putting themselves in the field of
a competition with the PT, the fight against "governismo"
leaving aside the struggle against the bourgeoisie and capitalism.
5.2 With such a policy, this left seems unable to

"Hardening" of the regime, of the dictatorship of the bankers and
big monopolies against the people.
7.6 Given this situation, the Workers' Cause Party
considered as a central issue at the present stage the fight for
a true Constituent Assembly.
7.7 The clash of huge street demonstrations
occurred this year and the police and judicial apparatus of the State
It showed that a real dictatorship is in full force in
Brazil. Protest became a crime, and attitudes that challenge
the streets the strength of the police state, and the arbitrariness of
Judiciary, have been transformed into a real attack
against the facade of democracy in which we live.
7.8 Cases like Amarildo and Claudia (RJ) - both
black - murdered PM, the UPP's, we massacres of
landless, show the methods of terror that the current regime
They use against the poor, black majority in the country.
7.9 a National Constituent Assembly is needed to
do what the Constitution of 88 did not: already dissolve the police
military; dismantle the whole repressive apparatus, ensure
election of judges and prosecutors at all levels by a vote
popular.
7:10 We must fight for real constituent to
an agrarian reform truth: putting an end to landlordism and
ensuring land to those who work it; confiscating
latifundia and distributing land to small farmers.
These and other accomplishments can only result from the mobilization of
workers in the city in the countryside.
7:11 The mobilization by the constituent should clarify the
need to end the arbitrary and control

in the trial of the "monthly allowance" and the arrest of the PT leaders
without evidence shows that, despite being in government for 10
years, is not the PT who really calls the shots in politics
national.
7:12 This is a real fight for Assembly
Constituent Assembly to approve a new constitution, which is the
basis for a radical overhaul of the Brazilian political system,
which must necessarily be supported by the population
working, the working class, rural workers and
other oppressed sectors by Brazilian capitalists and
imperialists. For this, the National Constituent Assembly,
democratic and sovereign can not be conducted by
parties that are there from the time of the dictatorship, can not
perform without an end to the monopoly of the press
cartelized right; without an end to the control of
banks on the national economy; without full
freedom of party organization and are
dismantled the repressive forces such as military police.

In these processes is very common that the abused woman

the prohibition of men holding management positions

8:10:10 against sexual exploitation of women
The last decades have been marked by ideology in favor
the sexual exploitation of women is the inviolable right of
bourgeoisie to exploit all spheres of human activity,
under capitalism. Democracy, in this sense, it was a
the main weapons used to legitimize one of the largest
attacks on women ever seen and a downgrade without
previous expectations of society and of women
particularly a human, and emotional development.
The ideology of democracy is that everything is permitted,
that with the proper payment. The female nudity can be
explored in all newsstands, and it is not
characterized the bombing of crime to decency, provided that
a commercial transaction recognized by the market through
magazines

as the luxury prostitution are permitted, including
euphemisms and new designations leaving the condemnation
