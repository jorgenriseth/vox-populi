Ideological basis
The Progress Party's ideological basis, liberalism assumes that people themselves are better able than
politicians to decide what is best for themselves and their families. We do not believe that elitism and central routing
is likely to create prosperity or happiness for the individual. Because every human being is unique, one can
not find one community solution that fits all. We therefore want more individual freedom and responsibility
individual.
Individual freedom requires that the individual take greater responsibility for themselves and their
own actions. Our humanity is based on the conviction that the individual has the capabilities to
govern themselves and face the consequences of their own choices. Generally speaking, it is also important that the individual has a
sense of personal responsibility for their actions. This means that people should be given a greater opportunity to take
care of themselves and their families with a minimum of state control and management. It also means that crazy
choice, as criminal activity, will have greater consequences than today.
A liberal view of humanity is based on that all people are different and should appear dignity. This must also
reflected in the treatment of people receiving public services. The best way to safeguard
people's different needs is by letting them freedom of choice to decide who will provide services they receive
granted. This means that all people who receive government services, will gain respect for their
individual choice, and not under guardianship done.
Future welfare depends on innovation and willingness to work to produce values. This can only
really done by the individual creativity released. Without workers and employers, those
produces goods and services, it would not be anything to distribute or consume. Political responsibility
to increase the prosperity of society should therefore lie precisely in making sure not to put obstacles in the way
for entrepreneurs, businesses and others who create jobs.
We wish limits to politics. Government Role in our ideal society limited. State power is now very
concentrated in a few hands. This is a threat to the diversity and distribution of power in society.
Concentration of power in the public sector also makes it more attractive to acquire positions in the state apparatus than
even working to create value. Power should be transferred from politicians to the people. We will do this by letting
residents retain more of their tax dollars, and through handing over more of the public
tasks to individuals, private companies and NGOs. Only in this way can create a
society which ensures freedom of choice, respect and opportunity for all people.

The Progress Party's principles
Progress is a liberal Democratic Party. It builds on the Norwegian constitution, Norwegian and western traditions
and heritage, on the basis of the Christian worldview and humanistic values.
The main goal is strong reduction of taxes and government intervention. The fundamentals in our
society is the belief in and respect for, the individual's uniqueness and right to decide over
own life and economy. The individual is, along with family and title, the basics in
community.
We strongly opposes discrimination of people based on gender, religion or ethnic
origin, and we will cherish the rights that the Constitution envisages; as property rights,
free enterprise, personal liberty, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and freedom of association.
The public power must be limited so that individual rights and freedom preserved. The public
should not take on tasks that may very well be solved by individuals, businesses and organizations.

2

We will use state-differentiated unit price financing of publicly funded services as an important
means to move power from politicians and bureaucracy to citizens.
We reject any form of totalitarian and authoritarian state power or ideologies aiming at this, and
ask ourselves very critical of any transfer of authority from the citizens to the public.
Our policy is based on democracy, with decentralized political power and decisions made by elected bodies, and
to legislate binding referendums as part of our constitutional system. The political levels
limited to the public sector.

Market economy for prosperity and a free business
Progress builds its economic policy in market economies. The prerequisites for
market economy is a free and independent businesses that have free flow of goods and services, free access to
markets and no special treatment or anti-competitive agreements. To be an attractive country for
food establishment must Norway have stable conditions with minimal bureaucracy and red tape.
Market economy also presupposes free trade between countries. Progress will remove import &
export restrictions and other trade barriers. Free trade and the market economy are prerequisites for
removing poverty through economic growth, utilizing resources optimally and to keep the price and
cost low.
We intend to reward effort and willingness to work. Lower taxes, together with a more flexible
employment, the best means for getting an efficient and well-functioning labor market. We want a
effective social safety nets for those who are unable to live on their own income, but it must always
worthwhile to work rather than receive public benefits. There must be introduced a tax system that should be
easy to understand, encourage initiative and contribute to less bureaucracy. Ideally, the tax system consist of a
high basic allowance and a flat percentage rate over this. The total tax burden must be the lowest and
excise duties must be removed if they do not have a specific reason and is earmarked.
Progress will evaluate the effects and consequences of the day payroll. A possible
reduction in the payroll tax could contribute to increased employment and increased wealth creation.
Businesses owned and operated best of private and professional, and it must be facilitated
private ownership. The public ownership must either have a financial or political grounds, and ownership
must be organized so that there is a distinction between politics and professional ownership administration. Government's role
as legislator, customer, owner, regulator, tax load and judicial power can quickly blend if
These roles are not clearly separated.
Companies and businesses are treated equally and fend for themselves without subsidies or
discrimination. Rules, frameworks and tax system must be predictable and uncomplicated.
In addition, considerations of supply and emergency basis for individual industries.
A country's prosperity is mainly the result of individuals' daily efforts in productive activities.
Work is also an essential basis for the general well-being. The Progress Party believes that it is first and foremost
the individual's task to gain employment, based on its own circumstances and education, and market
need for labor.
Labour, wages and employment contracts works best if these are achieved by agreement between
employees and employers in the individual enterprises. Such a system will help companies better
customized booms and recessions. It will also be in the employees' interests to contribute to securing
jobs in Norway through temporary changes to pay and working conditions. Through
business-related settlement wages will be more adapted corporate earnings ability and lead to a
3

better risk distribution between labor and capital.
Employment must primarily concentrate on value-added work, which can best be achieved in a liberal
labor. A free labor does not work well as long monopoly
organizations entering into agreements centrally for employees and employers. We advocate full
freedom of association, where the right to be organized will be as strong as the right to be disorganized. We
To preserve the right to strike and lockout right as instruments in disputes between workers and
employers.

Democracy
Tolerance
Progress would emphasize that all human beings are born free and equal and should have equal rights.
People should take into consideration what they do, rather than on the basis of who they are or what background they have.
All human beings are born different, and in a society based on equality, we must respect human
The unique character.
Party members can freely decide on matters of religious and philosophical character which is not uniquely covered
of of principles or action, including questions about adoption opportunities for gays,
Marriage Act means and assisted reproduction.

Freedom
The Progress Party's policy is based on the liberal ideology that gives all people the right to live as
free and independent individuals, as long as they do not unjustifiably interfere with other people's right to free and
independent way of life.
"My freedom ends where yours begins" is for us a maxim. This means we want to allow people to
life of their own, as long as it does not compromise the others. This provides a high degree of freedom, but at the same time
restrictively. We do not accept that one can live out their culture and religion if such abuses
against other people. There must always be concern for the individual human being, and its freedom and rights,
which must be essential for the policy pursued.
Democratic rule of law presupposes both a democratic state government and a market economy system.
Only a market economy can ensure the dissemination of power as a democratic state depends.
Constantly growing, government bureaucracy is a threat to the individual's opportunity for expression.
The public must be in a servant relationship to citizens.
The individual has certain basic rights, and these rights are:

Personal freedom and privacy
People exist primarily as individuals, and not as a collective group. The individual
have understanding and free will, and must therefore have the right to manage their own lives.
Freedom to decide over their own lives, also means that one should be guaranteed the right to a dignified life.
Progress will therefore in some situations allow euthanasia regulated by strict rules.

4

As part of personal liberty is privacy essential. Individuals' right to privacy and
personal integrity must be respected as a fundamental right. The absence of monitoring is essential in the
the individual's welfare. Legislation must strongly safeguard privacy.
The right of the individual to be able to live in safety and security, and the right to equal treatment by the authorities,
police and the judiciary are fundamental rights.

Ownership
Progress considers property ownership as an overarching principle, and oppose intervention in the
private ownership. Expropriation may be accepted only if it is absolutely necessary to ensure
essential community interests, and where it is not possible to reach agreement with the landowner on any other
manner. Furthermore, the expropriation carried out only against full compensation, so that the private
a property owner does not suffer losses. Any expropriation decision shall be brought before the courts for
over trial, also for determining the allowance.
Properties should not be tax objects. This is an unsociable form of tax which affects regardless of
ability to pay. We will work to remove the law on property tax.

Freedom of expression
Progress is a strong defender of freedom of speech and believes that everyone has the right to express themselves freely. We
To defend freedom of expression as a cornerstone of democracy.
We will highlight the necessary relationship between intellectual freedom and cultural and material progress.
Freedom of expression should nevertheless be limited so as not to damage the privacy and national security.

Religious Freedom
Progress defends the right to choose one's beliefs or religion, and to organize their lives in accordance
with this and will oppose discrimination on religious grounds. We accept however that
offenses, coercion, violence or threat to national security justified by faith or religion.

Freedom of choice
The free market economy is an essential condition for the individual's freedom of choice. Only the individual's free
the right to choose between alternative goods, services and political ideas ensures individual freedom.
The consequences of their own choices is the individual's responsibility. The free market and democracy are therefore inextricably
linked.

State Board
Norway will continue to be a constitutional monarchy, where the ruler should be the nation's unifying symbol
and head of state. Parliament should be the legislative and budgetary authority. Government should be the
executive body, but it must go off when it no longer has confidence in the Storting. The courts should ensure that law
not used in violation of the Constitution, and that the government and public administration does not impose without
pursuant to law.
The Progress Party believes that all citizens of the country must have the right to vote of equal value and importance when it
the composition of Parliament. Voting rights should be universal and not limited to specific
ethnic groups.
It should be introduced dissolution of parliament to parliament, but this presupposes the introduction of requirement
majority voting for the establishment of a new government.
5

We want appointments of Supreme Court judges must be approved by Parliament by a two thirds majority.
Judges in lower courts are appointed by a collegium administered by the Supreme Court.

Local self-government
Progress will strengthen municipal self-government in combination with increased user participation and
delegation of power down to local political bodies. Municipalities must have greater ability to control their
income and expenses, and greater freedom to organize their offerings in the way they think citizens have
most value. In addition, basic welfare services and health care, social services and
education ensured the population, regardless of municipal finance, through government differentiated
unit price financing.
Residents of a municipality has the right to govern themselves in matters that are primarily of local interest, and that
not by another law is added to others.

Referendum
Progress sees weaknesses in our democracy. It should therefore introduced a system whereby voters,
through referendums, getting directly decisive decision right.
Our representatives must always follow the results of a referendum.

Equality
Progress considers all people as equals. The relationship between gender, groups and
individuals should therefore adapt naturally in employment, public and private, without interference by
government agencies. We will promote equality and ensure equal opportunities and rights to social participation
for everyone, regardless of disabilities. Competition makes companies interested in securing so talented
employees as possible, irrespective of gender or group affiliation. Competition in a free
market economic system is therefore the best guarantee against discrimination.

Church and State
Progress looks at the Christian heritage, Western values, and separation between religion and
policy as fundamental values ​​in Norwegian society. Religious freedom is a fundamental
rights of the individual.
All faiths should be independent and in control of their working methods, organization and preaching,
provided that it does not entail any infringement or abuse of fellow humans or call to actions
that violates Norwegian law and regulations. Both community, church and state are best served with a distinction between
church and state, as a political-controlled church loses its legitimacy.
Our elected representatives can freely decide on matters of religious and philosophical nature which are not
uniquely covered by princi- or action.

Voluntary organizations
NGOs are an important part of society and contributes to diversity through personal
engagement. Welfare Society depends on the efforts of NGOs. Progress will
facilitate that organizations get more income opportunities and the opportunity to solve more
social responsibilities.

6

Energy
The government has an overriding responsibility to ensure the supply of energy, including an efficient power grid and
web links abroad. In energy policy should be emphasized that the natural environment is not subjected to
unsuitable loads.
Competition in the energy industry encourages best possible use of resources and lowest possible prices to consumers.
We will also ensure that value creation from natural resources for the common good through
licensing laws and special tax rules.
We want national control over energy resources and ensure value creation comes the Norwegian people
good through robust licensing and tax rules.

Environment and Climate
Environmental legislation must be based on fundamental principles such as equality before the law and protection of people's lives, health and
property against infringement.
Economic growth must happen in a sustainable manner, including through technology. To the extent
to use public funds for measures restricting pollution, so they should be used where they provide the best
result. Our principle is that the polluter should pay. Pollution knows no borders and
therefore Norway should work towards international agreements which limit pollution. Norway should not introduce
special rules and excise duties for Norwegian industry, which weakens our competitiveness internationally and
putting jobs at risk.
We are in favor of the public right and positive the establishment of nature reserves, national parks and the like,
provided that the principle of "conservation through use" applied. By earmarking of private property shall be
given full compensation.
Progress should lead a responsible and forward-looking climate policy based on facts. We will conduct
reasonable measures to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, and emphasizes measures that will have general
good environmental performance, rather than animal symbol measure. We will cut greenhouse gas emissions where one gets the greatest
effect.
A realistic climate policy must recognize that global growth in prosperity will continue, which means both
increased energy consumption and increased transport needs.
We want climate agreements globally anchored so that they do not lead to different framework conditions, and contributes
that industry finds it attractive to move to countries outside such agreements.

Security of life and property
The Norwegian society is regulated by laws and regulations, making it difficult for
residents to keep abreast of what is legal and illegal.
There is a need for a review of laws and regulations to facilitate and remove unreasonable and outdated
Laws and regulations. The laws and regulations applicable, should be enforced so that they have a general deterrent and
ensures the individual.
7

Police have not the resources to enforce throughout the extensive legislation that exists. In particular,
everyday and gain the crime been abandoned, enabling citizens lose confidence
police.
The time between a person performing a criminal offense for a criminal conviction, must be the shortest possible,
both for the victim and to ensure that the criminal gets to settle. The public sector should take
responsible for providing support and assistance to victims of crime, so the main focus is not to help
perpetrator.
There is a need for introducing stricter penalties for most offenses. In particular, it is necessary to increase
Penalties for serious crimes. Foreign citizens who are sentenced to more than three months
custodial sentence, should be exercised.
It is the individual citizen's responsibility to comply with applicable law and ensure that his / her
actions are not damaging or adversely affect other people.

Norway and the world
Progress will emphasize Norwegian foreign policy interests, both political and security.
This is best through a commitment to free trade, human rights and the building of alliances with
democratic states that share our values.
Traditional development policies have not worked satisfactorily. We believe that government financial assistance should
limited and streamlined. Norway should instead pursue the development of market economy and securing
poor countries' access to Western markets. However, we will maintain humanitarian aid.
Norway should continue to have an open and positive attitude towards the opportunities globalization brings.
Inter-governmental organizations can be a positive contribution to ensure stable international rules.
Some organizations have developed extensive bureaucratic structures. Therefore, efforts should be
Reforms, including the UN. Regarding the issue of Norwegian EU membership,
Progress respect the people's will through referendums.
In principle, there should ideally be the freest possible movement across national borders; of goods,
services, capital and labor. However, this presupposes that people who settle in Norway not
automatically receive welfare rights that charges Norwegian taxpayers. Decades of a social
integration policies which passivate and does not require the people who come to Norway, has created
social problems and adverse cultural tensions in society. Because of this one can not
continue the current naive and irresponsible immigration policy. Norwegian immigration policy must be restructured, and
you must ensure that immigrants are integrated into Norwegian society, and that they respect the basic
liberal values ​​Norway based.
Concern for integration must in some cases be given precedence in situations where this is considered to be in conflict
with the interests of freedom of choice.
Norwegian immigration policy must be based on that one requires immigrants who settle in the country.
Work Participation, language learning and respect for Norwegian laws are key elements in a successful
integration policy. Equal treatment of Norwegians and immigrants are essential to prevent
conflicts, which means that separate arrangements for immigrants should be dismantled.
Upon receipt of refugees should also take into account people's ability and willingness to integration.
Quota Refugees from the UN to be given priority. When in need of protection is over, he must travel
home.

Defence & Security
Progress will have a strong defense. We will ensure Norway's affiliation to NATO as an equal
ally in the NATO Alliance, and with NATO's partners. NATO is the cornerstone of our sikkerhetsog defense policy, and the United States are Norway's most important allies. This must be clearly shown through
ongoing collaboration and overall strategy choices.
The Norwegian Armed Forces must be credible and effective in relation to the prevailing threats.
Armed Forces must have a structure and equipment that is timely and appropriate, and that puts Norway in
able to react quickly in emergency situations.
We will uphold the constitutional conscription and open to enlisted troops in addition where this is
appropriate for solving specific tasks.
The purpose of the Norwegian defense and security policy must be to safeguard Norwegian interests.
Norway should actively contribute with troops in peacekeeping and peacemaking operations abroad. Primarily should
such operations based on the decision of the UN Security Council. Humanitarian considerations may however indicate that Norway
should also participate in operations led by NATO or coalition forces, though these because of the veto power
not approved by the UN Security Council. Such operations should not be financed out of the defense budget.

Family Policy
The Progress Party believes in principle that parents are best able to choose for their children. We will
therefore reducing the government's ability to regulate the private sphere.
We will strengthen the family's freedom through the reduction of taxes, and we want families in
as far as possible will be treated equally in terms of financial support. This will give parents real
options to choose the type of care they want for their children.
The family has for years been changing in terms of composition. The marriage is considered to be the
most stable framework for the family and will therefore have economic and legal benefits associated with it, but
all people have a clear right to organize themselves in a way they find best.
All children have a right to know who their biological parents are.
There is no human right to have children, but all children are entitled to a good and caring upbringing. Changes in
family composition should not come at the expense of parents' duty to raise their children, and both
parents should be on an equal when it comes to custody and care The right and duty of common children by
breakups.
Social development in recent years has led to a greater need for child protection, and has contributed to the
Some parents need help in their care role. In this situation it is important to work for an effective
and preventive child welfare which primarily caters to children, but which additionally also safeguards
parental due process in a good way.
There is a public responsibility to ensure that there is sufficient provision of nursery and
school programs, and supervision so that good quality and safety ensured, but it is not
necessarily a public task to run these.

10

Health and care
It is a public responsibility that everyone has access to necessary health services.
Progress will have a warm, dignified and optional elderly where the individual should decide over
his own life. It is not who provides the services that are important but that recipients are happy with it
offer their own choosing.
Citizens have a right to necessary health care when the need arises. We therefore wish to legislate
right to necessary care. It is unworthy of long waiting lists for treatment at
hospital, rehabilitation institution or substance abuse. It is economically irrational that many in
periods must live on transfers from the public because there is a queue to get treatment.
We also consider the dental service to be an integral part of health care.
The state should primarily be responsible for financing the necessary health care for citizens,
based on the unit price financing. We want the user fees be kept at a moderate level. However, the
the individual could choose between different centers and care services, both public and
private. Citizens must be given the power to opt out of offers they are dissatisfied with.

Work and welfare
The individual has the primary responsibility to provide for themselves and their families. The public should have a
safety nets for those who are unable to support themselves. Social assistance should be an
short term help for people in a difficult situation. The economic social assistance should be state
funded and managed by NAV. Stringent requirements for disbursement of public funds. Purpose
the requirements will be to ensure that more people become financially self-sufficient. We believe efforts to reveal the
who abuse the welfare system, and thus contribute to undermining the welfare system that is
built up in Norway, must be intensified.
Pension shall ensure the possibility to a dignified retirement and financial security in old age.
The pension system must be long term and predictable, and future pensioners must at all times be able to
obtain an overview of future pension.
It should be possible to build up private pension plans as well as the public. Deposits to such
arrangements should be tax-free, while withdrawals are taxed.
Social support schemes must be designed so that they motivate to take responsibility for their own lives and health.

Education and research
Progress will put knowledge at the heart of the Norwegian education, where the individual student's abilities and
opportunities safeguarded. The public shall have responsibility for ensuring that we get an education in the world. All
shall have equal rights to basic education and higher education regardless of their parents' resources.

11

The public sector should be responsible for its high quality and for the financing of education. Progress Party will open for
greater degree of private actors within the education system. There must be transparency about performance in school, and
it must be made to ensure that schools will be able to compare results and exchange experiences with a view
to become even better.
The education system must assume that it is parents who are primarily responsible for ensuring that children receive a
educations. The Progress Party is critical of a trend in which the public - through day care, after school and school - taking
over an increasing share of their upbringing.
Knowledge and education must be the objective of our education system. The Progress Party is concerned that the quality
in schools needs to be improved, and wishes to prioritize the content of basic education rather than to impose school owners to
increase the number of hours.
Progress Party believes that the hijab, niqab and burqa is oppressive to women garments. These should not be used in
primary school.
The Progress Party wants a strong public commitment to higher education. Parents economy should not be
decisive for who gets the opportunity to realize their capabilities through higher education. Nevertheless, it is
important to emphasize that students are responsible for taking an education one can make use later, and
it is important that it be conditional on implementation in determining the financial support.
We believe the government must take greater responsibility for research. Research in areas where Norway has merit
is particularly important to assert ourselves in global competition. It is therefore important that the basic funding to
research institutions increased, and that in addition established good public incentive schemes for
business-oriented research.

Transport and communications
Transport of goods, services, capital, information and people is essential for society's growth
and development.
The Progress Party believes that the state should have overall responsibility for infrastructure in Norway, and for that
transport and communication functions in an efficient and safe manner. With infrastructure, we mean all that is
necessary for carrying people, goods, information and energy; ie national road network including ferry, rail,
Air and marinas, terminal buildings, networks for ICT and energy transport. There is a public task
ensure that the country always have an efficient, safe and environmentally friendly transport and communication network
adapted to the needs of society.
The users of infrastructure should be guaranteed access on equal terms so that competition between the different
transporters equated.
It is important that emphasis is put on the most appropriate means of transport in relation to the
transport tasks to be solved. This will provide a more cost effective use of public resources, and in
Additionally, lead to a more equitable distribution of costs between the different modes of transport.
A fully-developed highway network that binds the country together in an efficient, safe and environmentally friendly manner, will
constitute the core of the country's total infrastructure for passenger and freight transport, supplemented by rail,
coastal / marine and aviation. A coherent plan for national road network must include hubs densely
possible integration between all transport modes.

12

In Norway, the way to remain a major part of the infrastructure for the transport of persons and goods. It is
therefore important to emphasize public responsibility for financing the road network in Norway, and the special
responsibility the state has to finance and invest in an efficient, safe and environmentally friendly highway network.
State shall have the financial responsibility for an appropriate road construction in the country, and all use of tolls,
road pricing or other direct road-payment is an additional tax on road users.
In principle, the fees are reduced and then turned toward consumption.
Progress wants rail network open to free competition, so that rail transport can
become more competitive. We will put the railway network capable of meeting current and future
transportation needs, and believes the authorities are responsible for rail tracks and other infrastructure.
Competition for passenger transport will, like freight, provide better quality. Also, other than
the state can finance, build, own and operate the new railway systems or new rail lines.
In Norway, aviation is an important public transport network. We will maintain a good flight network across the country, and
the offer must be based on competition and adapted to the demand for air transport. If
unprofitable airports is to be maintained, this should be done by grants from the state budget.
We believe that Norway needs maritime transport which will enable them to perform their task on a
efficient, safe and environmentally friendly manner. Sea transport is essential to establish effective hubs
transport of large volumes across transport modes. Public and private ports should be equal, and it
must be established competitive conditions equivalent to these conditions for
sea ​​transport.
The ferries that are part of the national road network, must be free to use for users.
If using taxes to finance infrastructure, the Progress Party that there should be consistency
between fees and costs related to the investment, operation and safety. We reject the use of fee to
regulate the use of transport modes.
We believe that the state should be responsible for financing the investments in the national energy transport network
and ensure that they are open to operators and users. The state must ensure that dominant ownership is not unreasonable
frames operators and users.
The State shall also have overall responsibility for the network that provides secure and fast data transport, covering all
parts of the country, and are open to operators and users.
Operation of transport networks for people, goods, data and energy must include safeguards against accidents and undesirable
events. We believe that the state should be responsible for framework, funding and oversight regarding
transport safety.

Kang
Progress wants a vibrant cultural life based on personal involvement and volunteerism, free from political
management. Cultural policies based on the principles of freedom of speech and tolerance. Cultural works best
without political governance. Progress Party will therefore that cultural development should be as independent as possible of
public financing and intervention.
Where government spends money on cultural initiatives, it is important that the money is going to good people. Funds
targeting children and adolescents must be prioritized.

13

Culture is a broad term that encompasses everything that characterizes the nation and the people. The Norwegian culture
the result of the choices and values ​​you have gathered about, spiritual and material. It is an important task to
cherish our Norwegian heritage.
It is a prerequisite for growth in the cultural sector that focus on interaction between the voluntary sector
and professional players. This will eventually provide the best lasting repercussions both for culture and for
society.
Conditions must be right for sports organizations, allowing them as much as possible bases its operation
on its income from voluntary work and other voluntary contributions from members.
The ideal business to voluntary groups and organizations should be momsfri.
A country's press is not independent if it is dependent on support from the state. As the press being
more and more dependent on government subsidies, independent journalism give way to industrial policy effort
To ensure more support. Progress sees a danger in that the press critical attitude towards the state board will be muted on
Because of government subsidies.
Press support also creates adverse competition between the media, since only one selected group of
newspapers being awarded this support. Progress Party believes it is wrong that newspapers with government support to compete with other
media companies that operates on commercial principles. We want a free competition without
financial contribution from the state.
We want to create long-term and predictable conditions for those who must apply for a license for television or
radio operation. We believe that it must be made for own-clock frequencies for all local radio stations
who needs it.

DEMOCRACY
Progress will that every ballot cast in parliamentary elections should count equally. We also want the people through
referendums should be allowed to decide important political issues. Voting rights should be universal and
not limited to specific ethnic groups, therefore we will discontinue the Sami Parliament.
We will set clearer limits on the administration's right to make discretionary decisions.
Appointment of judges of the Supreme Court should be approved by Parliament by a two thirds majority, and judges
the lower courts should be appointed by the court administration.
When at least one third of Parliament's members require, the Supreme Court give its opinion on whether
a statutory is unconstitutional.

The electoral system
Progress will encourage increased voter turnout. We will lay down the county councils and the Sami Parliament and change
current electoral system so that elections to local councils and to parliament implemented collected every four years. A
Such an arrangement would make it easier for parties to present coherence of policy at local and
national level. It also provides a more efficient electoral system when resources for carrying out election
concentrated to every four years. Such a change of the electoral system can also help to increase
election turnout.
The Progress Party wants the counties' representation in parliamentary elections shall be decided by how many voting
living in each county.

Referendums
Progress wants to put certain issues before the referendum. In major societal issues
we want citizens to be able to claim these settled by referendum. It shall be collected signatures
from at least ten percent of the voting citizens to support the claim.
We want a system where the people through referendums by a simple majority will have direct decision-making authority.

Equality
Progress will not accept discrimination. All people are equal, why should not
laws, regulations and rules discriminate through affirmative action.
We will open a voluntary spouse shared taxation where spouses' efforts can be equated taxation and
National Insurance purposes.
We want to equate parents when it comes to caring for children and want to change the Children Act, with the
intends to introduce equal rights to responsibility and care.
It is in some immigrant communities that equality has come shortest. It is therefore important to stimulate these
communities to increase equality. This is also a prerequisite for successful integration.
Progress will:
4




remove clause to which imposes quotas
equate parents by breakups

Freedom of choice
Individual freedom is a fundamental value for Progress. Every single human being can
even best determine what is right for themselves and their loved ones. It also means that the individual in larger
degree must take responsibility for their lives and actions. Such humanity is based on that each
human being is unique and should appear dignity.
Independent and responsible citizens who increasingly get their own choices without interference from the public,
will stimulate diversity, competition and individual solutions. To encourage greater freedom of choice in all
sections of society is therefore essential for the modernization of Norway.
Freedom of choice has an intrinsic value in that every individual is empowered, gains influence over their own lives and
increased self-esteem. This in itself is so fundamental to a well functioning society that increased freedom of choice should
Search for all sections of society.
Competition on the supply side inspires innovation, modernization, technological development,
specialization, cost reduction and efficiency improvement. We see this in all parts of the private sector where it is
established consumer power and a well functioning market. Goods and services are developed and delivered based on
demand from the individual consumer.
Similarly, arrangements may be established in the production of all publicly funded welfare benefits. Statutory
rights to welfare services, combined with the freedom of establishment and unit price financing directly to the
service producer consumer choice will ensure such development.
Progress will:
 the implementation of its own choice reform in the public sector
 equate public and private providers

Modernization of the public sector
It has in recent decades been a tremendous growth in the central administration. A modernization of Norway must
therefore imply clear requirements for efficiency in the public sector, while the use of private and nonprofit sectors
public welfare production intensified.
Modernization is about offering good welfare services in the core areas. It is then a
condition that defines the public activities and commitment.
It's simply that you should play against the best at all times. Use of competition
stimulates wealth creation, better services and efficiency. It is therefore essential that competition
becomes a pervasive element in all public activities.
All information about the use of resources, measured results and quality in the public sector should be public
available.
A modernization of Norway must intend to simplify legislation and deregulated society. This shall
practices mean that detailed control of regulation of business and private property rights that exist in today
legislation, should be removed. To a greater extent should the law be used to set limits that ensure neutrality,
environmental considerations and predictability for business.
This must also involve a sharp reduction in the number of statutory bodies consulted, and an appraisal of
Opposition right in land matters. National interests permitting an objection must be clarified in the law, and not as in
Today, with extensive use of guidelines, national guidelines and discretion that limits ownership and
local self-government.
5

Objections which restricts ownership and local self-government should be reduced to an absolute
minimum.
Supervision can generally be performed by the government or by individual on behalf of the public. Progress Party believes that supervision
should be as independent as possible, to ensure equal treatment between private and public
service providers, and to ensure that deviations actually be corrected.
Progress will:
 undertake a simplification reform to modernize the public sector
 strengthen the private ownership
 legislate citizen right to free user choice
 review all public inspection services

Central government
The arrangement with governmental agencies should initially be such that they acted as service units
for each organ. This has Fremskrittspartiet assessment evolved into a situation where
directorates both performer policy and control functions.
Progress wants a review of the structure of ministries and directorates with a view
simplifying and de-bureaucratise them, and free up resources that can be used in a far better way for people
most.

The county
Progress will renew Norwegian government to reduce public costs and bureaucracy.
The county does not have sufficient legitimacy as an independent administrative level. The county has
been, and is, an unnecessary and costly part of the public administration. We will therefore embed
counties as independent administrative and distribute tasks between municipalities, state and
private.
Regardless of the number of elected administrative levels should future tasks in public administration
rationalized and streamlined. This includes tasks incumbent on regional and state
sectoral policies.
It established a number of state, regional institutions with considerable bureaucracy and impact on the
local, regional and national democracy.

Fylkesmannsembetene
The Progress Party believes county governor Semb's role in the current management system should be reviewed
considering liquidation. Portions of office tasks related to objections by the Planning and Building Act,
performed by an administrative tribunal. In the short term County Department objection right and discretion is limited to
legality.

Commune
The Progress Party believes that local authorities are the very foundation of local democracy. Municipalities constitute
foundation of local democracy and represents closeness, belonging and opportunity for influence
population. Much has changed, however, since the current municipal and county structure was established, not
least technology, communication and mobility.

6

The individual must be the starting point for all good policy, and the point of democracy and market economy
that individuals should have power and influence over their own lives and their own local environment. The road from people
Most to power in Parliament and in government quarters are often long and cumbersome, and we are real
committed to strengthening local democracy, with particular emphasis on direct democracy. Referendums and
citizens' initiative is important in this context.
We will therefore that the municipalities should be given greater financial responsibility in that state financial equalization
between municipalities is reduced, and that the state transfers based on an objectively differentiated
capita grants, free Skattør and ownership of the corporation. In addition, we will ensure 100 percent financing
of the primary tasks through government unit price.
Local self-government must be strengthened by transferring public responsibilities from the state, counties / regions and
regional government to the municipalities. This presupposes, however, that municipalities are robust enough to be able to assume
, and to perform these tasks. Society goes quickly towards a stronger copyright societies. Many of
current municipalities already have too few resources. It will be difficult to recruit the expertise and
human resources in small municipalities. This will be a major obstacle to increasing local autonomy.
Progress Party will conduct a demokratireform, where it studied a modern and appropriate
kommunestruktur. Municipal structure shall be determined by Parliament and should be designed in a way that
maintains good service and efficient use of resources. Such demokratireform will ensure strong
municipalities that added most local autonomy.
Progress will:
 implement a demokratireform
 initiate the transformation of municipal income system
 substitute county governor offices with an administrative court
 review the state administration with the aim of transferring tasks
 remove county municipality / county governor's opposition to the municipal planning and land use decisions

MARKET ECONOMY
Progress working market economy in which individuals and business can freely operate within
general conditions drawn up by the authorities. A well-functioning market means that
consumers mainly manages supply through its demand.
International trade has helped to lift millions of people out of poverty. Trade has also been
important for Norwegian industry that has been able to sell their products abroad and thus created
revenue for Norwegian residents. A functioning international market economy is an important prerequisite
for good welfare. Consumers enjoy today well of competition across national borders. There is a need for
further liberalization of trade rules, and we will work for the freest possible world trade.
Progress will:
 liberalize the economy to create more growth and more welfare
 have effective measures to ensure more competition
 pursue more free trade
 ensure poor countries' market access to Norway

Fiscal policy and monetary policy
Progress will pursue a responsible economic policy. The state must put a good framework for a
functioning market economy that stimulates wealth creation and prosperity, and control their finances on a
7

responsible and predictable manner. We must create confidence between businesses, citizens and government
authorities. Business is dependent both on the favorable conditions for the individual industry, and of a good
investment climate with predictable framework for inflation, interest rates and exchange rate. Folks everyday security
about a healthy economic development and order in the economic conditions. Progress will add
to facilitate this.
Growth in the public sector must be kept lower than the growth in the private sector. Too large public sector
penetrate so large funding from the private sector that it will hamper value creation. The public sector must downsized
and streamlined so that the citizens get better services.
The Norwegian state has a unique financial situation. Norway has large net worth, and because of
petroleum industry is the large surplus in the annual state budgets. This maneuver will
FRP use to build the country through investments in infrastructure, research and development.
Although the state has great values ​​must avoid a situation where the welfare state and high state
consumption over time means that the government finances are not sustainable. Progress Party believes Norway is heading into such
situation, and believes there is a need to replace the current fiscal with a new anchor for the
economic policy.
Progress Party believes it is necessary to distinguish between operations and investments in the state budget. Such a separation takes
note that expenses tend to be more inflationary than economically profitable
investments. It should be assumed that government spending should not grow more than GDP.
Today's fiscal approves purchase of shares and equity injections into public companies
called "formuesomplasseringer." Such capital investments made outside the guideline. This
practice must also apply to economically profitable investments in infrastructure, central
buildings and major capital goods. This will involve major road and railway projects which currently creates
bottlenecks in the transport network, will be resolved far quicker while providing a sound basis for economic
growth. The same will apply for investments in health care, police and ICT.

Oil Fund
Progress supports the idea that exploitation of petroleum resources should have a
generational, where value creation will benefit the entire country for good in the long term. Progress Party
mean values ​​should be invested both abroad and in Norwegian society economically profitable assets. High
oil prices have made the Oil Fund is growing far faster than expected. The Progress Party wants the Government Pension Fund
(SPU) to continue to invest the majority of assets in securities abroad. But the size makes it possible
should have several investment strategies.
Progress Party will therefore work for the establishment of a fund that focuses on active management, and that this
exerted by Norwegian capital environments. The property portfolio should as a separate entity. It should be established
funds for investment in developing countries and an investment fund aimed at companies in the
renewable energy. Companies that Norfund should be supplied more capital to develop the company in a positive
direction. Common to these is a continued focus on market-based and profitable investments.
The Progress Party wants the parts of the government's financial assets will be invested in unlisted shares, and that the management of
those funds shall be made by competent institutions in Norway.
Progress will:
 replace the current fiscal with a new anchor for economic policy
 distinguish between operations and investments in state budget
 define economic, profitable investments as wealth relocate
 ensure stable and long-term conditions to ensure increased productivity
 ensure Norges Bank a free role and set a low inflation target

Free trade - customs / import protection
Goods on the way to Norway today meets a wall of special rules and customs requirements. Its purpose is to protect domestic
producers against foreign producers. These trade barriers are both unreasonable and unjust.
High tariffs and protection regimes means that goods become more expensive for Norwegians. Especially in the food sector
are high tariffs, but also in other areas helps high tariffs to poorer service and more expensive goods
for Norwegian consumers and businesses. On top comes a costly and complicated regulations.
Norway's value creation and economic growth are dependent on good framework conditions for the export of goods to other
countries, yet are not Norwegian desire for global tariff reductions mutual when other countries that want to sell goods
to us, being faced with import barriers and protection measures in the world. At worst, such a policy
cause Norwegian products are difficult to sell, because it will often be the case that if Norway
imposes duties on another country's products so this land will impose duties on Norwegian products. Simultaneously
it means that Norway contributes to effectively shut out many of the poorest countries of the growth in prosperity
we have experienced through trade.
Although the poorest countries (LDCs) have duty and quota free access to the Norwegian market for all goods,
have other developing countries, such as Kenya, Vietnam and Guatemala, tariff walls in 100 percent class
for various agricultural products.
Trade is a tool to get started productivity growth, efficiency and innovation. Today's customs system
leads unfortunately that capital is used in an inefficient manner compared with a system with free trade
where one takes advantage of the differences between countries.
Consumers benefit from a system that gives them stable prices and full shelves. Meanwhile freer
Trade benefits both the Norwegian export industry and for a fairer world trade.
Norwegian tariffs and protection regimes should eventually be removed as part of the international
negotiations. It should be introduced zero tariffs for all developing countries, and the limit for duty-free imports should be increased
immediately.
Progress will:
 that Norwegian tariffs and protection regimes are removed in the long term as part of international negotiations
 negotiate bilateral free trade agreements
 the introduction of zero tariffs for all developing countries
 that the limit on duty-free imports increased

Business
Progress will pursue an economic policy that stimulates further development of industries where Norway
has historical and natural advantages.
The main task of industrial policy is to encourage greater wealth creation in business. Everyone should be in
basically have the opportunity to establish a new business without permission from the government or from private
organizational side. We will therefore work to remove and simplify bureaucratic laws and regulations
prevents this.

9

Progress Party believes that all industries intend to operate based on the principle of free competition, because
this also in practice gives the best social solutions.
Today's widespread public ownership concentrates power and influence in a few hands. Political management
Businesses inhibits long-term thinking and value creation. When the public both to monitor, regulate and
monetize the same market, there will also be a part composition which may lead to
unequal treatment of market players. One objective of our economic policy is therefore to build
down public ownership through sales.
When government ownership is exercised by the government, through the ministers or the minister's elected representative, it may cause
the abuse of market power and creating uncertainty about the purpose of political or financial gain. Then
while ownership is directly influenced by political considerations and not separated in a fund model with professional management, must
it for all state enterprises be made clear whether ownership has a political management purposes or a financial
return purposes.
We accept nor that local and regional governments, directly or indirectly, using its
administrative and regulatory position in competition with other market participants.
With increasing international competition on framework conditions, as well as more mobile capital, it is important
to pursue an industrial policy that makes it profitable and attractive for companies to operate their business in and from
Norway. We will provide solutions where the government encourages private investors to invest in risk capital
technology and expertise.
Norwegian industry must be developed based on the nation's natural resources. There are long traditions of
natural resources are owned by the community, while material wealth created by the resources exploited by managers
Businesses with good licensing rules and reasonable taxation. We will ensure continued national control over
natural resources to ensure that workplaces, headquarters and development located in Norway. Also take
we increasingly allow private companies to compete against state-owned enterprises so that natural resources are processed by the
actors who are best, not just those that are publicly owned. Among other things, the industry should be able to own hydropower plants
when this strengthens the kraftforedlende industry's competitiveness and used to secure jobs
Norway.
Progress will:
 make it easy to start your own business
 reduce paperwork and simplify reporting to the government
 remove governmental discrimination of industries and individual companies
 reduce public ownership
 ensure companies maneuver without political interference
 ensure a competitive tax
 ensure that public funds and grant programs provide support for objective criteria and
profitability
 facilitate access to highly skilled international labor
 use instruments other than subsidies across sectors, industries and enterprises

Small and medium-sized enterprises
A large proportion of Norwegian value creation occurs in small and medium enterprises. Therefore wishes
Progress improved framework conditions that stimulate growth and development. This must happen
at reduced bureaucracy and red tape, as well as a long-term and predictable policies. That way it becomes
easier to start, reorganize, renew and operate small and medium sized businesses.
The Progress Party wants to make it easier for businesses with low turnover to be granted annually moms task
(VAT task). We believe that the current maximum level with a turnover of one million kroner should
increased.
10

Progress Party will make today's rigid rules around pre-payment of tax for self-employed more
business friendly so that businesses do not unnecessarily get into financial difficulties as a result of
this.
The Progress Party wants to introduce a so-called RAV (cleaning, caring and service work) and ROT deduction (rehabilitation,
renovations and extensions) for embodiments of the services in the home, following the model scheme in Sweden. This will
both contribute to combating undeclared work and to make the overall resource usage in society more optimal.
Progress will:
 that the limit on half-yearly reporting of VAT increased to 10 million
 raising the limit for auditing accounts for 10 million for all businesses that use authorized
accountant
 simplify HSE requirements for small businesses
 strengthen legal protection for small and medium businesses
 adapting the Working Environment Act for small and medium businesses
 do current regulations around prepayment of tax for businesses more agile
 introducing a RAV and ROT deduction for finishes of services in the home

Innovation and entrepreneurial policy
Future jobs created - they adopted not. Growth will come in knowledge-based industries, where
human capital becomes increasingly important. Spin-offs and start-ups must be encouraged. Progress will
therefore facilitate a proactive innovation policy, where entrepreneurship, R & D and
human resource development stimulated. Tax policy should be used actively to secure good entrepreneurs
framework and financing. In addition, state funding agencies change, so that good ideas and
Products secured support and funding, regardless of where in the country they are created.
Norway needs Innovation Norway or other body with similar tasks which cultivates its profile
on field innovation and innovation rather than providing support for investment measures in traditional industries.
To encourage greater entrepreneurial activity, we also want to open that youth can start
sole proprietorships from the age of 16. This can be ensured by guardians or other issuing a guarantee
for business to people under 18 years. Programs like JA should be strengthened.
Innovation and innovation is about more than business start-ups based on simple ideas. It depends
also of access to venture capital for ideas and projects with a large value-added potential. The Progress Party wants
therefore increased access to startup capital for entrepreneurs.

ICT
Increased investment in ICT and broadband are key to future prosperity and growth in Norway. Progress
believes that the state must have an overall responsibility for all parts of the country have access to fast broadband
at least 100 Mbps. the same way that the state should have the financial responsibility for road and
railway development. Opportunities for rationalization through active use of information and
communication technology is great in both the private and public sectors. Therefore, we will lead an aggressive IKTpolitikk for Norway's future. This means that the responsibility for the overall ICT and
broadband policy must be contained in a single ministry.
It should be used a common login system for all public services. This can be linked to
today's online banking login systems. There is no reason for the public to develop expensive solutions
varying success rate when there are existing providers at home and abroad with well-functioning systems.

11

An effective and reasonable use of ICT could save society a lot of bureaucracy and unnecessary use of resources.
Key elements are electronic ID and signature solutions for all its citizens, national ID card
with built-in e-signature, electronic mailbox for information from the public, e-billing, e-prescription,
electronic medical records, electronic transmission of X-rays and care.
All public tenders in the ICT area should consist of two components: one for the system and one for hedging and
control of the system. These must be assigned to different suppliers to ensure the best possible quality of
public policy portals where large amounts of sensitive information shared.
ICT development should not come at the expense of privacy and people's right to privacy. It is therefore important
with a strong Data Supervision and clear legal restrictions related to what information the authorities
and private agencies can collect and utilize the individual. The Progress Party is opposed
Data Retention Directive and other legislation implies that the entire population of practice set under
the-clock surveillance. It should also introduce a statutory protection of freedom of expression and privacy
on the Internet. The individual should have full sovereignty over their own personal data.
Progress will:
 ensure high-speed broadband in the country
 the application forms and relevant information should be available electronically at any time
 have a common login portal for all public services
 the creation of a clear digital strategy for the public sector
 integrate public ICT systems
 collect the overall responsibility for ICT policy and broadband construction in one ministry
 introduce legal protection of freedom of expression and privacy on the Internet
 give the individual full sovereignty over their own personal data

Taxes and fees
Taxes and fees are needed to finance the tasks we must solve together. Also affected
individuals and companies' choice of level of community taxes and how they are arranged.
A high tax level will help to reduce work effort and twist investments away from Norway. It is
therefore important to have a fiscal and tax system that is broad, has low level, is respected and enables all
sensibly helps fund public tasks. Combating undeclared work must in this respect
be a priority for the authorities
We prefer a tax system with low tax rates, few loopholes and tax credits, rather than a
system with high tax rates and many loopholes and tax credits. Such a system will also contribute to
Businesses and individuals are focusing on creating value rather than spending huge resources on
tax planning.
Globalisation entails competition in providing the best framework conditions for businesses. Norway must
therefore adapt and lower their tax burden to attract profitable companies and international
expertise. The system must be simple so that the collection of taxes does not entail huge costs.

Personal taxation
A low tax makes it more attractive to work. High income promotes interest for tax evasion
and dispositions which are entitled to tax credits, rather than seek to increase income. Through selection
education, working hours and occupation have the individual opportunity to influence their salary levels. A high tax level with
high degree of redistribution weakens the will to improve their economic situation. Income distribution in
society should primarily be the result of the individual's free choice to appreciate effort,
income and leisure, not a result of progressive taxation. It is not a public task to equalize
wage differences that naturally occur in the labor market.

12

There should be introduced a flatter tax structure with large basic deduction that contribute to that more people can manage to live by
own income. We will gradually reduce the progression of the income tax, to the stimulation of extra effort.
This system will help the high-income groups do not need large wage increase to compensate for
progression in the tax system structure. Besides, avoid that industries with high wage levels
transfer the tax burden to consumers by increasing prices.
A large proportion of the wealth tax payable by pensioners and ordinary wage-earners. The funds are usually
taxed several times and wealth tax discriminates Norwegian ownership since few other countries in the world have
such a tax. That means for example that foreign owners will not have wealth, while Norwegians must pay
wealth tax on shares in the same company. The special Norwegian wealth tax must be paid even if a company goes
with deficits. It can also have the unfortunate consequence that an entrepreneur and owner of a company in growth and
who have not yet earned money, you must take out dividends, taking up private loans or sell shares to pay
wealth tax.
The special Norwegian wealth tax has also entailed moving from Norway and loss of Norwegian jobs.
Progress Party will gradually eliminate current capital tax by increasing the tax-free allowance. In this context it should be reduced
a tax commission aiming to eliminate tax gaps and improving the tax system so that it becomes more affordable
and fair for the country's taxpayers.
Progress Party will also eliminate the inheritance tax, while we will reduce stamp duty and several other fiscal charges
to liquidate these in the long term.

Corporate taxation
Progress will have a tax system that encourages investment, growth and innovation. We will also
work towards a harmonization of the tax burden on capital and labor by tax on earned income is
reduced.
We will consider introducing nutrient deduction for self-employed corresponding minimum allowance for
wage earners.
Norwegian company taxation must ensure that Norwegian business has the same framework as
our main trading partners. Specifically Norwegian taxes should be wound up including capital tax, which is a
double taxation, and that inhibits Norwegian private ownership and capital. Furthermore,
depreciation pace assessed against the situation in the countries we compete with. The level of
Company taxation must be considered in light of international developments. Scheme should SkatteFUNN
be better to be able to support private research and development than the current device is.

Surcharges
On a general basis, believes Progress that fees are used to pay the costs a product
or a transaction to society. The tax must therefore reflect the real costs.
Stamp duty and re-registration fee of vehicles are examples of taxes that have evolved to become
higher revenues for the state, instead of payment for an actual service. We would otherwise have a simple system that
possible, and find it necessary to adapt the tax system and the tax level to the international
competition.
We will assess the effects and consequences of the current payroll taxes, and reduce employers' contributions
for apprentices and seniors.
Norway is an elongated country where car use is a necessary part of the infrastructure. Progress Party will therefore
vehicle-related fees that time when buying a new car, annual fees and re-registration fee shall be reduced
significantly. Wreck The deposit will be increased. How will your fleet is renewed and become more safe, environmentally friendly.
13

Car-related taxes should increasingly be consistent with the public costs of construction, operation and
maintenance of the road network.
Special taxes on cross-border reply should also be reduced limit for duty-free imports should be increased, and tariffs
should be reduced with the aim of freer trade. We will also reduce electricity tax.
Environmental taxes should increase earmarked for environmental purposes.
Progress will:
 have a lowest tax level
 have a flatter and more transparent tax system with solid basic allowance
 remove the wealth tax and inheritance tax
 ensure firms internationally competitive tax conditions
 that tax to a greater extent will be earmarked to pay for the expenses the charges
service / product imposes on society
 that the tax system should ensure value creation from natural resources benefit the local communities
benefit
 reduce stamp duty
 reduce excise level of car and car use
 reduce taxes on cross border tradable goods

Value Creation
Norway has a decentralized business structure. A large part of the value creation occurs outside urban areas.
Through general framework must be taken to ensure that value creation to occur in
districts, and that values ​​greater extent must be retained where they are created.
Municipalities that actively facilitates economic development, should be given for this by the corporate tax.
This should be done in such a way that not all the funds from corporate tax harbors in the municipality where
head office is located, but a proportionally correct part accrues to the municipalities where the value added
actually taking place.
One of the main challenges for businesses in rural areas are related to transport. Transport of goods
to customers and markets are a significant challenge the farther away one gets from major ports and cities
in Norway. Hence the need for increased development of infrastructure in the country.
Progress will:
 have lower taxes over subsidies
 make it easier to start and run your own business
 reduce the amount of form
 simplify public administration, laws and regulations
 prevent public companies given special advantages which distorts competition
 that applications and inquiries to the public must be answered by the stipulated deadlines
 turning parts of the corporate tax from state to municipality
 initiate all-time transport boost

Fisheries
Fisheries and other resources that it is possible to harvest the sea, are national resources and will be managed
then. This shall be done on the basis of a knowledge-based regulatory regime that ensures an optimum extraction of
biomass associated with individual stocks. Participant Act and the Raw should be reviewed and modernized.

14

Sales organizations monopoly on first-hand sales of fish and residency requirement by generational in
fishing companies are among the things that will have to change.
It must therefore be determined TACs for the various fisheries so that resources are managed with a view
long-term, sustainable returns. Progress wants to ensure optimal utilization of
fish stocks. This can be done through transferable quotas and facilitating a close
interaction between companies, industries, research institutions and other actors. Permits to exploit parts of
marine resources should be allocated by the state. These permits shall be traded between players in
industry. It is also important to ensure programs to address recruitment within the fishing industry.
Progress Party will stimulate further user-driven research on the exploitation of fishery resources. Including potential
Receiving and processing of live fish. This can ensure a better and more predictable access to raw materials. We will
Also consider the quota year should be accrued to ensure a better access to raw materials for the onshore
industry.
Principally Progress Party welcomed the delivery obligation for the fishing industry. Earlier agreements should, however,
respected. One can however consider whether these agreements must be linked to specific regions, above
municipalities or harbors.
It is essential to invest in research and development within the fishing industry to become more competitive
towards low-cost countries. Norway will not be able to compete in terms of labor costs and must therefore be
forefront technological solutions.
It must be initiated increased research within the seafood industry to exploit the potential byproducts have,
including, for example, health / medicine.
Sustainable exploitation of resources requires international cooperation and agreements. Norway must therefore
help secure contracts and effective control of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Reacting
illegal hunting must be investigated as serious economic crimes. It must be reacted strictly on violations
and other forms of cheating with quotas.
Coast Guard and fisheries control must be given sufficient funds to increase efforts to combat illegal fishing.
It is necessary to have certain regulations of the fisheries and the need for a revision of the current
regulation models, with a view to better determining the TACs, the exploitation and the most
predictability. This will provide stability and form the basis for a better planning within the industry. Such
stability will encourage long-term investments for industry, fishermen and fishing boat owners.
We see the benefits of having a diverse fleets and considers diversity, proximity, flexibility, financial resources and
stable framework conditions as positive for competition and would facilitate this. It is important to put
Started action to reduce bureaucracy and simplify legislation.
Progress will:
 review the Raw Fish Marketing Act / Fish Sals Team Lova and Participation Act
 have increased research in industry
 develop a system of transferable quotas
 the annual TACs are determined by a calculation range
 ensure an optimal and sustainable utilization of fish stocks
 ensure effective control of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing
 eradicating crab outside commercial zone
 work towards an international instrument against dumping of fish

15

Aquaculture
Norway's long and somewhat protected coastline with clean sea and a decentralized settlement pattern, and
manpower with expertise in aquaculture, is appropriate to strengthen the nation's position as
a leader in farming of seafood. Close to the market for fresh seafood, as well as knowledge of land
processing of fish, make sure it is appropriate for a greater degree of processing within the country's borders.
The Progress Party believes that the aquaculture industry has great potential for increased expansion and value creation
through farming of new species and a greater degree of processing. There are currently too strict conditions
the allocation of licenses for aquaculture / fish farming, which negatively affects the industry. The concession terms
must be liberalized and managed according to sustainability principles where the licensing authority is transferred to the individual
Municipality.
Progress will:
 better conditions for aquaculture
 liberalize licensing conditions and transfer the licensing authority to the individual municipality
 liquidate public ownership in aquaculture
 a review of the excise duties which industry pays
 that an export tax and R & D tax must be controlled by industry
 strict but impartial professional veterinary and environmental demands of the industry
 facilitate the production increase
 encouraging municipalities to set suitable areas available for aquaculture

Marine Mammals
Progress recognizes the importance of sea mammals' role in the marine ecosystem, but as other resources,
must these stocks are managed on the basis of a comprehensive and sustainable management. Efforts must be made
internationally to put in place solutions that ensure the possibility of export of marine mammals.

Agriculture
Progress will encourage efficient production of safe, good Norwegian food. Agriculture is an important
industry in many districts. Progress Party will strengthen agriculture's competitiveness and will ensure that the industry should be based
on market economic principles, such as the country's other industries. We believe that Norwegian food producers
shall have the framework for production which is in line with our neighboring countries, but that one takes into account
our high cost and our special climatic and structural conditions.
The Progress Party wants a clear distinction between agricultural policy and regional policy. The purpose of
agricultural policy shall be cost effective food production.
We want to modernize agriculture framework by facilitating the farmer should be able to
develop their business. We will do this by replacing political regulation and restrictions
free enterprise. The farmer should be able to use the opportunities a freer Food Market and trade provides. We must use
the time until a new system of international trade in food products is in place, to strengthen
competitiveness of Norwegian food producers. Only so can the agricultural industry is prepared to meet the
competition as a new trading system for food will involve.
Today's policy of massive adjustments and transfers have not worked. By abolishing and simplifying
laws that currently restrict farmers' freedom, agriculture will be better able to manage on an equal footing with
other industries.
We will decentralize power in the industry from politicians and organizations to the individual farmer and consumer
through to liquidate on agriculture system. On agriculture system is replaced by an independent body
on the basis of figures from agriculture calculates the then necessary nutrient transfers.

16

It is a measure to implement full freedom of enterprise for the agricultural industry. We will gradually implement
deregulation of agricultural conditions and in line with this gradually implement reductions in
nutrient transfers.
The Progress Party wants to turn the industry transfers from full-time farmers. We want a linear system
rural settlements, which means that the transfers increases as production volume
increases. We also want to remove the subsidy ceiling for the largest farmers so that these farmers to a greater extent
could retain rationalization gains achieved by increasing production volume.
Progress Party realizes that the current structure with many small farms is a challenge for those farmers who wish to
Investing in agriculture with the aim of being able to live this. The areally small farms means that
too large a proportion of the income of these farmers is used to lease the land, and yet also production quotas
from those who have chosen to withdraw from agriculture. We therefore want to encourage it to be easy
for those who want to invest in agriculture to buy land from those discontinuing operations, while it should be
beneficial to sell the land for those who want to liquidate. Tools that we will consider is the favorable tax rules for selling,
and the ability to sell land to finance land purchases for those who need more land to own
production.
Current production quotas and licensing restrictions seem anticompetitive and prevents a
market consumer power, therefore they must be liquidated. The individual producer must be free to deliver their
goods to whoever offers the most favorable terms. Cooperatives special schemes and market control must
liquidated. Producers must be able to choose the products to be sold directly to the consumer, brand, or to
processing.
Manufacturers can sell self-produced alcoholic products directly to customers.
Progress will gradually phase out all subsidies for fur industry. We will also review legislation
related to animal welfare for fur industry in particular and husbandry in general, to ensure that animals are maintained in a
manner.
Progress will:
 gradually introducing free enterprise for the farmer and as a consequence gradually reduce
other subsidies
 the production and prices should be governed by market
 liquidate on agriculture system
 reintroduce free ownership of agricultural properties
 discontinue licensing, housing and drive duty and inheritance regulations
 remove the system of market regulations and target prices
 remove production constraints, such as that quota and license limits
 the farmer himself can choose the organizational form for their business
 open access to international markets through free trade agreements
 give consumers access to a wider food selection
 establish a fund where the farmer can allocate part of their profits tax-free, to investments or
to cover deficits. Withdrawing profits from farming operations for use in other operations
taxed as capital by 28%
 allow option when the alternative use of agricultural land
 build stockpile of grain equivalent population nutritional needs for one year

Veterinary services and animal welfare
Municipalities are responsible for satisfactory access to the services of animal health. Therefore
veterinary services are organized so they are a good and predictable scheme, which will provide better
utilization of resources and the protection of animal health and welfare.

17

Less administration will also release resources for animal health primary tasks, namely
welfare of animals and the protection of animal health. It is unacceptable that large parts of the country have not
satisfactory access to veterinary services, and that this contributes to local differences in terms
animal welfare.
Norway should have a strong animal protection. People who have proved incapable of keeping animals shall forfeit
husbandry. The Progress Party wants to establish a wildlife police in Norway to ensure animal welfare and to take over
Food Administration tasks related to animal husbandry.
Progress will:
 the establishment of a separate animal police

Maritime sector
Progress wants to strengthen short sea shipping because it makes sense to transport goods in this way. Progress Party
will stimulate the renewal of the fleet by introducing scrappage and better depreciation scheme. One should also
consider measures to reduce the direct costs of port calls.
Norway's international position is further enhanced by having a complete maritime environment
internationally leading players in most areas. Shipping companies, financial institutions, equipment
including suppliers of ICT, shipbuilding and classification societies.
The maritime industry is a significant contributor to the Norwegian shelf is at the forefront in developing new
technology. For the Norwegian maritime cluster should retain its lead, and that Norwegian workplaces should
secured, we depend on a stable and high activity level on the shelf. This ensures important arenas for
innovation and technology offshore.
To ensure competitiveness, we will as soon as possible to have in place a legislative framework for the use, transport and
bunkering of LNG so that the industry's need for conversion of heavier fuels such as diesel and heating oil
not delayed.
Progress Party will ensure Norwegian shipping internationally competitive framework. This will give Norwegian shipowners
ability to sail under the Norwegian flag and give Norwegian seafarers the same framework as sailors in our
neighboring countries. Moreover, we will give priority to maritime training and recruitment of Norwegian youth to the industry.
Continued stability in the tonnage tax and competitive terms is vital for Norway to be
a safe and attractive investment country, and to maintain foreign fleet in the future.
Foreign Fleet contributes greatly to keep Norwegian maritime skills alive. Their jobs are
important, especially in rural municipalities. Expertise on board is one of the industry's most important resources.
Norwegian sailors need a statutory net pay scheme which is in line with what we might find in,
Denmark. The scheme should also apply to Norwegian seafarers on NIS-registered ships.
NIS regulations forcing Norwegian shipping companies to use foreign flag if they are to operate maritime transport in Norway
and Europe. NIS is currently the only ship registry in the world that does not give ships allowed to transport goods or
passengers between Norwegian ports or on the Norwegian shelf. Progress Party will consider providing limited access to Norwegian
ports for NIS ships. We also want a thorough review of the possibility of harmonizing legislation in
NOR and NIS.
It must be considered new measures to prevent emissions from ships in Norwegian waters.
Progress will:
 expand and legislate net wage scheme for seafarers
 draw up a national port strategy to establish good transport interchanges
 prioritize maritime education and recruitment of Norwegian youth merchant



ensuring internationally competitive terms for shipyards and subcontractors

Commercial tourism and service industries
The services sector is the part of the Norwegian business sector that grows most. For these to be able
develop their full potential, it is important that the establishment and anticompetitive arrangements removed.
Progress will therefore liberalize a number of restrictions in the retail industry, including
hours regulations, licensing, løyve- and license conditions as well as restrictions on the establishment
and locating new businesses. This will also include export, import and sale of all legal
goods. We will work to influence other countries to suspend their import restrictions.
The tourism industry is one of the world's fastest growing industries, and that Norway is well qualified
take part in. Norway's special qualities through distinctive scenery and rich cultural heritage, make it an exciting
destination, and the industry has therefore an untapped growth potential.
Tourism industry takes the country in use and is therefore an important rural industry, both in terms of creating jobs
and local development. For that Norwegian tourism should continue to assert itself internationally, the business sector in
cooperation with the authorities to invest more in innovation, product development and human resource development. This is
also necessary instruments to create more year-round jobs.
It is necessary to increase marketing of Norwegian tourism. The current structure of DMOs,
Reiselivsråd and similar carrier, however, feel that there are too many of them, and that they are too fragmented.
This means that work becomes inefficient and have a bad development. There is a need for a restructuring
which involves fewer players and a clearer division of roles.
Nightlife is for many tourists an important part of the travel experience and often decisive for which destination they
choose to travel to. To ensure the competitiveness of food and beverage outlets and an offer adapted to demand, should
dining places themselves fix their opening and serving times.
It is naive to believe that the cost of alcohol, food and other expense items not relevant to the choice of
destination in an international tourism market with an infinite range of travel experiences and destinations. A lower
level of taxation on products such as alcohol and food will help to keep Norway as an attractive destination with the
wonderful natural experiences we have to offer.
The Norwegian travel industry is an important rural industry. The profitability of tourism businesses are consistently
weak and the individual enterprises are often very vulnerable to changes in the market. Today's fiscal and
tax system does not consider the special conditions which apply to these. Also the availability of
several of tourism companies offering is poor, due to landslides and winter closed roads, in addition to bad roads
general.
Laws and regulations must be adapted in such a way that they do not hinder the development of experience centers,
hotels and farm holidays in rural Norway.
Norwegian travel sector competitiveness weakened by a generally high cost. The Norwegian VAT
in serving, which currently is 25 percent, significantly higher than Sweden and Finland. A
serving VAT of 15%, in line with Norwegian VAT for food for home consumption, will strengthen
competitiveness in the industry.
Progress will
 build out infrastructure to gain increased access to regional destinations
 reduce VAT on dining
 strengthen the branding of Norway as a tourist destination



Alcohol and tobacco
Today's high taxes and extensive regulations on the sale of alcohol leads to smuggling and illegal
production. Progress think a more liberal alcohol policy will lead to a more relaxed attitude to
alcohol and healthier drinking habits, as well as get sales of alcohol into legal forms. The best
preventive alcohol and tobacco policy lies in providing information and raising awareness of the
individual responsibility for their actions.
We recognize that excessive use of tobacco and alcohol can lead to serious health problems and are
supporters of public information about adverse effects. We would still oppose bureaucratic measures
aims to prevent older people can enjoy legitimate products.
Progress Party believes that it should be allowed to market all products which can be legally sold in Norway.
Progress will:
 liberalize alcohol laws
 abolish the monopoly for the sale of alcoholic beverages
 ensure a satisfactory control system for sales of alcohol
 that the age limit for buying and serving of alcoholic beverages is set equal
the age of majority
 reduce the tax payable on alcohol and tobacco so that it lines up with our neighboring countries to
avoid trade leakage and smuggling
 liberalize Tobacco Act
 Norway to follow EU rules for imports of alcohol and tobacco

Housing policy
The home is the biggest financial investment many of us make. The authorities have a responsibility to ensure that
it makes way for available land areas, and that it introduced unnecessary requirements and
obstacles that put unnecessary pressure on housing prices and makes it disproportionately difficult to slip into
the housing market. Pressure on housing prices primarily affects young people in the establishment phase. We
would therefore partly reversing the recently introduced requirements for universal design and finishing as
have made new homes several hundred thousand kroner more expensive to build. We also want to liberalize requirements
apply to rental units / secondary housing in existing homes; then avoids many of these must be removed
rental market due to new technical requirements.
A scattered and more flexible housing policy is crucial for the housing market to function and that
house prices are at a proper level. This requires political will to invest in the opening of areas currently
have strong restrictions, densification of urban areas, changing the boundaries of the forest including the removal of
Marka Act, liberal attitude to higher construction and real funding for investments in both road and
collective networks in and around cities. Progress wants through such instruments to facilitate
increased housing construction and reduce the abnormal high pressure on the housing market. We want to remove
County Governor's office and reduce state objections from ministries and directorates. These bodies
has largely stopped and delayed planned construction projects.
There is an important principle that banks are free to make the necessary assessments of the individual and
family's ability to service loans. We therefore wish to remove the equity requirement for mortgages and allow banks themselves
20

determining the individual and family debt capacity. This will also help reduce the need for the number of persons
applying for home loans from the government. The strong growth in loans through municipalities the past
years has been a development that has created an unfortunate dichotomy of the mortgage market.
Each year several thousand students without a place to stay. The Progress Party wants to make it possible for private operators to
build student housing on the same terms as student organizations. If current monopoly arrangements
abolished, it is possible to build more homes at a lower cost and faster. We want to use creative
solutions used in other countries to quickly set up several student residences, such as the fallow or container student cities of high quality. Progress also wants to raise the limit of what young
people annually and overall could save through BSU scheme (Housing Savings for Youth).
We want Parliament repeals the law on property taxes so that municipalities would lose their ability to demand
tax on property. Property tax is considered to be an unworthy double taxation of the municipality
citizens and businesses and take neither regard to the individual's income or debt. We also want to
remove the current stamp duty. The stamp duty payable has been a government revenue source that increases the cost of purchases
without tax paid are relative to the actual re-registration costs.
Progress oppose today's stringent shoreline policy and residence requirements.
Progress will:
 facilitate increased regulation of available sites in the municipalities by putting a stop
for many of today objections from state and county governors
 reverse costly detailed requirements for universal design and finishing
 raising the limit for savings through BSU scheme
 remove equity requirement for mortgage
 let private build student housing on an equal basis with student organizations
 remove the current stamp duty
 remove the law on property tax
 eliminate inheritance tax and wealth tax

ENERGY
Stable and affordable energy supply is fundamental for the development of a modern affluent society.
Norway is one of the world's leading energy nation, with access to almost unlimited clean and renewable energy.
With this background, Norway is an important player in the global energy picture, and has both advantages and
challenges related to this.
Progress will facilitate that Norway will remain a major energy power, where the energy sector is a
important part of our business. It will create favorable conditions for technology, high added value and good
standard of living. This will also benefit the country's citizens and businesses benefit through access to energy
a reasonable price.
We see today the lack of will and vigor to utilize our renewable energy resources, and the result
becomes unstable and high price both for people and businesses.
It must be made for the use of the energy sources / forms such as whole is most profitable,
environmentally friendly and efficient for society. Symbol Actions that are counterproductive environmental and
costly, must be avoided.

21

It is important to encourage the most clever use of energy. Tax cuts on
energy saving measures for both private individuals and businesses must be long-term and predictable.
Mains are crucial for power supply, and the government has an overall responsibility for this
infrastructure. There is a need for an effective and rational organization of the network companies, so that
maintenance of the network optimally, security of supply and high consumer costs low. It is important
that grid companies are stimulated to develop networks that enable profitable power development. The TSOs
that does not meet its obligations for maintenance and upgrades should not draw dividends for their
owners.

Hydropower
Progress will seek to ensure that hydropower can be exploited to a greater extent. Hydroelectric power is a renewable and
environmentally friendly energy that has given Norwegian industry an important competitive advantage. We encourage the development
of economically profitable and environmentally sound water resources projects. Progress Party will also consider whether
Some watercourses which today are protected, can be developed carefully.
The state must stimulate the upgrading / modernization of existing power plants through the tax system.
Licensing of hydropower need to be simplified, this is especially true with regard to the development of small,
mini and micro power plants, which have a great potential and positive environmental effects. Concession Manager
small, mini and micro power plants transferred to the municipality.
We want national control over energy resources to ensure that workplaces, headquarters and
development located in Norway. At the same time, we have no objections to that individual can own
power / power company when appropriate. Norwegian industry has owned power plants for over 100 years, and thereby
secured jobs, population and wealth creation around the country.

Alternative energy sources
There are many different options that could have a potential in our energy supply - either directly through
thermal energy or via electricity production. Some of these are bioenergy, wave power, tidal power,
geothermal, solar, wind power and offshore wind turbines. Increased use of renewable energy sources can contribute
to make energy use more flexible and help create value.
Investments in construction for example, geothermal or lake should be deductible for all, so that
the environmentally friendly energy supply increased.
Such an approach to alternative energy sources ensures the most energy at the lowest cost while
one should assume important factors such as noise and environmental impact. It should be encouraged to develop
new energy technologies, but one should await large-scale implementation of these technologies for they prove to
be robust and profitable.

Nuclear
The world anticipated growth in energy use in this century will be a major challenge in terms
resources, prosperity and stability between countries. As an energy nation, Norway should work actively to develop new
energy technologies that can help to meet energy needs.
The Progress Party believes nuclear power is one of several technologies that must be considered. Norway should therefore look
a closer look at the potential that lies in the further development of modern nuclear power, including the use of thorium
as an energy resource. This will be important for Norway, even if you choose not to build nuclear power. With few
exceptions all our neighboring nuclear power today, and more countries will develop new nuclear.
There are still challenges related to nuclear power, but Norway should still be enrolled in Euratom and take part in
international knowledge and research on nuclear. That way one can contribute to developing
22

safer and more modern nuclear power plants, while also contributing to the development of emission-free energy
world.

Fossil energy sources
Progress will facilitate increased use of natural gas for domestic added value and in
households, as well as the use of gas as fuel in the transport sector. Main Infrastructure
natural gas must be a public responsibility.
It must be made for the establishment of profitable plant. Such power should have the same
environmental requirements in the EU. It shall not be Norwegian requirements for example CO2 capture.
A CO2 quota system must be integrated with the EU, and allocate allowances free CO2 permits to industry and
business in line with the EU.

Petroleum activities
The petroleum industry represents significant value, and it constitutes an important engine in the Norwegian economy.
The industry accounts for around a quarter of total value creation in Norway, there is a significant
employment and contribute to both industrial and technological development of great significance.
Norwegian oil policy must be encouraged continued value creation, profitability and competitiveness in the industry.
Value added can also not be taken for granted as it is largely influenced by world market prices. They
recent years, oil production on the Norwegian continental shelf dropped significantly. Progress will lead an offensive
policies to counteract further negative development of production.
The challenges for the petroleum industry are becoming increasingly complex. Much of these resources is found
at greater depths is less volume and farther from shore. There is a need for continuous competence and
technology if we are to maintain the level of activity on the Norwegian shelf. The industry therefore needs
long-term, predictable and competitive regulatory framework. It must be stimulated competition and
The diversity on the Norwegian shelf.
The tax system must actively contribute to making niche and tail production more profitable, so that we increase the life
the fields and get the highest possible recovery rate.
Norwegian petroleum industry is in many areas leading to environmental work. The industry has shown a willingness and ability
to meet challenges and find new solutions that offer confidence to future petroleum activities outside
coast. The state must increase its contribution to a better oil spill, with a view to avoiding environmental disasters by
accident. This is also important with regard to increased shipping traffic from Russian oil and gas fields.
It is important to ensure access to attractive new exploration acreage, also in the northern areas. A further development of
shelf in the North will be able to give a boost to the business community in the northern region. Progress Party will open for
impact of Nordland VI, VII and Troms II (waters off Vesterålen, Lofoten and
Troms) as soon as possible, with the intention to open for petroleum activities. Activities must take place in
according to strict environmental standards in cooperation with the fishing industry and in accordance with the Petroleum Act
provisions.
Technological development in the oil industry is very important for future value creation for the nation and Norwegian
petroleum industry's global competitiveness. Such technology has significant positive
repercussions for industry in general.
The state is by far the biggest player on the Norwegian shelf. The state must therefore take a much greater responsibility for R & D
in the petroleum industry. There should be created an energy and petroleum fund to ensure
long-term aspect of this research.

ENVIRONMENT
Conservation and Outdoors
Progress supports public right, with individual responsibility for travel along a considerate manner, with
considering the landowner, environment and other uses of outdoor area. Both landowners and the public
responsibility for preventing conflict. Where conflicts arise these should be resolved locally, using laws
and regulations and local conditions. The private ownership should be given particular emphasis in such cases.
The landowner's interests should be better protected when it comes to the public's border with pastures and private sphere.
The general ban on construction in the 100-meter zone to be removed, but it must also be ensured that there is
sufficient shoreline available to the public.
When creating new nature reserves, national parks, etc. shall be added to local democracy
decisive weight. The principle of "conservation through use" must invariably be applied. Restrictions related to
protection should only be designed to prevent the destruction of the natural resource base. The Progress Party is supportive of evaluating
Revocation of established protected areas.
It must focus on the creation of hiking trails and other outdoor venues that come most people to good.
Access for young and old with universal design where appropriate, will this for many
be what you need to get out in the activity.
Progress Party will allow municipalities administer the Act relating to motor traffic on uncultivated land. Motorized traffic in outlying areas to be adapted
outdoor life, but should also be included as a part of it. The good solutions for handling this
the challenge lies in the municipalities, among those who live there and know the local conditions. Norway has
great distances, sparsely populated and livelihoods strongly linked to primary industries, tourism, hunting and
fishing. This suggests that one should have a very flexible approach to snowmobile use in many parts of the country.
Progress Party also wants to harmonize the legislation relating to the use of watercraft with legislation for the use of
small boats.
Outdoors is an important issue among other things when it comes to school, teaching and public health. Outdoor activities are also
an important area for the development of tourism-based industries.

Predators, hunting and trapping
Progress wants a rich plant and animal life in Norway. It should be sought maintained a population of eagles,
wolverine, bear and lynx. The management of this must take place locally where they have prerequisite for evaluating
situation, and therefore must be prioritized predators zones liquidated.
Self-defense right now applies for attack dog, should also apply when predators come into the infield
and not be scared away. It should be the same interpretation as the basis for the use of self-defense right
faced bear as it is for other predators.
Progress Party has understanding for a ban on the use of lead shot at shooting ranges and in wetland areas, where lead is
contamination danger, but not for total ban on the use of lead shot for all hunting. Lead is basically a
very suitable hail material to obtain human euthanasia. A reasonable differentiation
lead shot ban would both safeguard to protect the environment while having a reasonable and well
hail material for use in the woods and on the mountain.
Norwegian rivers are breeding ground for half of all Atlantic wild salmon. Wild salmon is important as indicator species in
natural environment, but also for outdoor life and source of income and culture carries along Norwegian rivers. It lives
be a priority environmental policy task to preserve and strengthen the Norwegian wild salmon stocks.
Wild salmon has great value as livelihood for many communities and for the practice of outdoor activities for many
humans. At the same time, there is reason to emphasize that power and wild, with current technology,
far better be combined than 20 years ago.
Progress will:
 repeal heartland of predators
 maintain local management of wild
 let local governments have responsibility for predator management
 that transboundary predators are considered part of the Norwegian population goal
 that it be imposed on the state to provide full compensation to landowners, traders or others who suffer
losses resulting from the state's overall predator management
 the introduction of quota hunting where this does not threaten the overall survival of the stock
 provide treatment of gyro infected watercourses high priority
 strengthening research on how wild, production of power and farmed salmon can coexist
 seek to ensure that it can be used lead shot for hunting on solid ground and over open water

Pollution and emissions
With pollution we mean mainly the emission of substances in soil, air or water that could harm people
health, property or nature. Measures to limit pollution must be efficient and safeguard
the principle of equality before the law. Pollution knows no borders, and a substantial part of
pollution in Norway is due to emissions from other countries. It is important to establish international agreements on
environmental area so that Norway not unilaterally take the strain for environmental measures.

25

Just business types should have the most equal emission permits, both in a national and an international
perspective. Current practice and legislation, where every company considered individually, is unfortunate because this leads
to distortion of competition and unnecessary bureaucracy. There is a need for a strict environmental legislation whose main
task should be to prevent any damage to other people's health, property or nature. Consideration must be given to
total ban extremely dangerous or destructive substances and production methods. This work should however first
and foremost done in international forums, such as the EU / EEA cooperation, not through
unilateral national regulations.
Requirement should be used where there are recognized purification methods can be used without unreasonable
high costs for industry. Concessions and discharge permits should be used in given situations and given by
Climate and Pollution Agency (Klif). In terms of a license shall clearly indicate the amount and type
type annual emissions given permission. Permits for emissions of gases that can provide long-
pollution shall be negotiable, so that they can be sold to another company or monitor
production if transferred to new owners.
We want to reduce excess bureaucracy in the Ministry of Environment, the counties and the municipalities,
and will give Klif task of ensuring that pollution regulations are complied with. Police should strengthen its
expertise in investigating violations of environmental legislation.
Progress will:
 work towards international environmental treaties that ensures a level playing field
 that environmental taxes increasingly earmarked environmental measures

Climate
Earth's climate has always been changing and therefore represents a natural part of the planet's evolution. They
past few decades, science has had a strong focus on climate change as a result of human
activity. Progress Party relate to that research shows that human activity affects the climate but
emphasizes that there is great uncertainty about how much this represents in relation to natural
climate variations. As Research has proven, research is too small to natural climate processes,
compared with research on human contributions.
Progress Party will stimulate broader research and open, critical debate around the causes of - and the extent of -
climate change. Good understanding of the challenge is important so that you can better prioritize community
scarce resources for various purposes, such as to prevent or better adapt to adverse changes in nature.
It is necessary to have a nuanced climate debate. The problem that politicians and scientists from the United Nations
Intergovernmental Panel draws attention to, can be severe. The warnings give grounds for caution.
At the same time speculative and opportunistic when some groups connect any flooding, hot flushes or cold wave,
storm etc. to the claim anthropogenic climate change. Especially within such communities overarching
issues it is important to ensure robust, long-term decisions that have popular support and
which manages taxpayers' money in an optimal way.
International environmental problems must be solved through international agreements, which include mechanisms for
cost-effective implementation. Progress Party finds that Norway should implement reasonable measures to
cut CO2 emissions both nationally and internationally. The Progress Party is wary of indiscriminate use of "precautionary varprinsippet". We assume that the measures are results-oriented and based on long-term cost / benefit analyzes.
The Progress Party is critical to use climate policies to raise taxes, fees and expenses for residents and businesses.
Man must respect taxpayers 'money and citizens' desire for predictability and flexibility in
everyday. We are therefore critical to introduce ever new prohibition, restrictions and other public
interventions that restrict individual freedom or weakens Norwegian competitiveness. Progress Party will instead
encourage environmentally friendly behavior through positive measures.

26

Norwegian industry is already far ahead when it comes to environmentally friendly production with low resource and
energy consumption. The Progress Party wants the state encourages further research, development and implementation of new energy and environmental technologies, with a view to strengthening Norwegian business cluster competitiveness.
Norway must avoid special Norwegian, strict CO2 measures leading to that economic activity and jobs moved to
other countries to embellish the Norwegian CO2 accounts. A global climate deal must prevent so-called
carbon leakage and have mechanisms that equalizes competitive disadvantages between industry who must answer for
CO2 costs, and industry in countries where such costs do not exist. A national ceiling for CO2 emissions
hampers further development and new establishments in Norwegian industry. Today's CO2 target of an absolute
ceilings for national emissions, must be replaced with a goal of gradual reduction in CO2 levels in various
industries.

Resource and waste management
The Progress Party believes that private ownership is a good guarantee that natural resources are managed in a good
manner. When renewable resources are privately owned, the owners have a vested interest in ensuring that forever you
reap a dividend. State land and forest properties that are not of public interest, should be sold to private
actors or transferred to the municipalities. Permits to exploit parts of ocean resources, should like today,
awarded by the state. These permits should however be traded between private actors.
We will pursue a rational, environmentally sound and efficient management of waste from households and businesses.
We believe that modern incinerators as far as possible must be used, and that the conditions are right
that such facilities can be established and operated without waste must be transported over long distances. The heat from
facilities should be used for heating water, heating or electricity production.
We should do more to exploit the resources of wet organic waste for biogas production.
We want to give business and industry the best possible conditions that may facilitate the
recycling and encourage reuse. We believe that competition stimulate waste sector will provide
economic and environmental gains.
Differentiated waste charges are a positive means of creating a fair system that rewards them
that pollutes the least, with lower fees.
Progress will:
 competition stimulate waste sector
 differentiated waste charges

SAFETY FOR LIFE AND PROPERTY
Police
Progress wants a credible, modern, dynamic, popular and responsible police.
The police must be able to prevent and follow up offenses. The police must have the necessary equipment and
legal basis for being able to work in a proper and efficient manner. Investments in audiovisual equipment and
IT equipment can contribute to effectiveness of police working methods. This can help to free resources so
that we can get more police officers out on the streets and less on office with administrative tasks.

27

The Progress Party wants to give police greater access to weapons, and opens for general arming of the police in the
police districts who see a need for this. Weapons training at the Police Academy and the general training for
graduation must be strengthened.
Many places harassed residents of the beggars and other groupings engages in an unwanted and criminal
activities of daily life, without it being turned down by the police. We want to make the police a clearer
Pursuant to ensure public peace and order and to reinstate the ban on begging. It should be permitted
pilot projects in the largest cities where one can establish a local police force that will give priority to secure public
peace and order.
Citizens must have confidence that the government does not control the privacy. We therefore wish to limit
use of surveillance with the exception of the matters relating to national security and serious crime.
The courts must approve the use of surveillance. It should be in some serious cases could be allowed for
Police to use provocations to reveal serious criminal activity.
The fight against crime must be sharpened. Crime exerted by foreigners, the law-abiding immigrants a
disrepute. All foreign nationals who are punished with more than three-month unconditional
jail, should be exercised. Expulsion alone is not enough to prevent the crime, but must
combined with a good integration policy. A tighter courses in immigration will also benefit
common understanding of the many law-abiding foreigners' presence.
Progress Party will reorganize the police force to strengthen neighborhood police. This will mean that police districts replaced by
larger, more powerful and competent police regions. That way you will streamline paperwork,
investigation and support. Freed operative police force to strengthen neighborhood police. In addition,
bureaucratic procedures by the sheriff's offices more efficient, and offices replaced by police records with 24
hour operational readiness.
This structure will be better suited to create an aggressive police adapted to today's and tomorrow
challenges and provide an opportunity to meet new types of crime. Both organized crime and terrorist threats
requires other instruments and a different focus than the current police are able to deliver.
In each police should be built up emergency centers, preferably by helicopter aid and
readiness troops with low response in the event of emergencies. Where appropriate,
burglaries cooperate on such emergency centers.
Progress Party will also change police training and recruitment to the police. The police need a modular and
differentiated police training. Police must increasingly recruit the skills the agency needs. The
Must be able to take part of a police education and qualify for specific tasks, rather than the current
practice where everyone gets first generalists, and then specialize in certain subject areas. Education
must also be reorganized to be more Law enforcement and operational training.
This gives police greater expertise and can recruit the necessary personnel faster.
It should also increasingly focus on ensuring that civilians can take over tasks of the police. For example,
civilian attaches to analyze crime data and financial crime.
Progress Party will establish its own investment budget for the police so that necessary investments not go on
the cost of routine operations. In line with what we have proposed for many years, will need IKTopprusting, purchases of cars and safety separated from the operating budget and thus ensure high
staffing and presence while police renews the necessary equipment and infrastructure.
Progress Party believes customs agency should receive limited police powers and be able to take a more active role in
crime prevention at borders. Drug trafficking and human trafficking are areas where customs agency
Competency is a much greater extent should be used to raise the effectiveness of crime prevention
while police are relieved. It should also be given access to the customs agency to print spot fines
and thus the determination of the easiest and least serious cases on the spot.

28

In the search for victims or presumed victims at sea shall Navy and Coast Guard assist the police in
search.
Progress will:
 prioritize more resources to the police in general and ensure that capital police have enough resources
to protect both their special tasks in addition to nationally important tasks
 invest in new equipment, including audio-visual equipment and new computer equipment to streamline police
work
 introducing a new police training in several stages
 bring in other professionals to ensure the support of the police and streamline tasks to skilled
police
 accept the use of preapproved Roma and wiretapping, as well as evidence provocations
 accept the use of pre-approved surveillance in cases concerning national security and serious
Crime
 strengthen police ability to ensure public peace and order
 that the police should not engage in tasks that can be performed equally well, or better, by others
businesses
 expel foreign nationals sentenced to unconditional imprisonment for three months or more
 have several police dogs, including drug dogs

Prosecutors
Prosecutors must be able to rapidly follow up on the cases that are investigated by
police. We believe that the public should be allowed to hire lawyers in private practice to lead
criminal cases in order to wind the heavy workload.
Progress does not accept that criminal cases with known perpetrator shelved due
capacity problems.
We want to expand the public legal aid scheme. There is great need for legal aid, especially among
disadvantaged groups. To alleviate the growing need, must also volunteer aid measures supported.
Progress will:
 ensure that cases with known perpetrator not being dismissed
 that police and prosecutors in individual cases shall perform their duties independently of government and
Parliamentary
 that police and prosecutors should be clearly separated from each other to achieve independence and
optimal legal protection

Prison and probation
Progress will remove atonement queue. This can be done by allowing private players operate
prisons commissioned by the State. Zoning Queue frames convicts, victims and society at large. Population
lose confidence in the rule of law when the perpetrators, even after serious crimes, can walk freely around in anticipation of
atonement. Particularly bothersome is this for the victims and their families. Foreign nationals who commit
Crime in Norway shall, wherever possible, zone in your home country.
The Progress Party is wary of the government's continual expansion of home atonement with electronic control. This
Emerging as a mild form of house arrest and not as a punishment. In addition distinguishes this sanction
among the weakest in society who do not have home or work and others who actually have it. An ever
expanded capacity with an open prison building walls down, and criminal element rehydrated.
Electronic control should be restricted to use against them with minor offenses and in the transition from
Annual atonement for freedom. This includes also leaves.
29

Zoning capacity within the walls need to be expanded, and one must begin by expanding capacity in already
existing prisons.
It is important that the penalty acts as a deterrent. Today's prison sentence in Norway is not sufficiently deterrent
for those who come here with the intent to commit criminal acts. Progress Party will therefore establish their own
Devices for foreign criminals in older prisons with somewhat lower standard and without economic and social
benefits for the inmates.
Norway should take advantage of the atonement agreements we have with the criminal homeland, and possibly renegotiate these
so they can be more effective. At the same time efforts are being made to put in place an atonement agreements with even more
land, so that we can buy atonement pitches in his home country for the vast majority who matter should be exercised.
It should be established separate prison units for young people and special rehabilitation measures should be introduced in
these departments. Criminal youths falls too greatly between several chairs where no finally feel
responsibility. This team needs a clear framework and better predictability of everyday life, something
which makes correctional well suited to monitoring sanctions against them.
Progress will:
 remove atonement queue by building more atonement pitches and open to private providers
 sending foreign nationals out of the country and allow them to serve the penalty in homeland
 negotiating extradition treaties
 open for private prisoner transport to free up police resources
 that aftercare should be offered in appropriate forms
 open for purchases of atonement places abroad
 that gave the go directly from legal judgment for atonement
 the implementation of better measures to reduce recidivism
 establish separate youth prisons

Courts
Progress focuses on ensuring individual legal protection. The courts should ensure prompt and
fair treatment. This is also important to avoid that persons are in custody for a long time. We look at
principle that one is innocent until proven guilty as fundamental to the rule of law. We
believes the courts and court processing must be modernized, and that the proceedings must be streamlined.
The courts should also have the freedom to be able to use simplified court proceedings to a greater extent.
To further strengthen the independence should court administration (DA) made more independent of
Ministry of Justice and Government at the budget process for courts made similar scheme
OAG. Parliamentary Ombudsman and EOS Committee must be directly under
Parliament. DA board's composition should also be considered.
It is too long of a case is investigated until it is settled in the courts. Queue in the court system
inflicts both victim and culprit unnecessary suffering. We want to impose limits, allowing defenders
which is paid for by the government not given the opportunity to undertake cases they do not have time to finish when the court has
put them up for discussion.
We want to develop the scheme for faster courts for certain types of cases to bring up efficiency and gain
adjudicated more of everyday crime. Quick Court shall have extended opening hours, and take matters
where police have taken perpetrators and preserve evidence. Foreign nationals who commit crimes,
can also be taken through the quick court and be in custody until the case is settled and they can be sent out of
country.

30

There is a need to review the system for appeal because the intention of the current system is misused.
The government uses a disproportionate amount of resources on the appeals, and it needs to look at
tightening of the rules.
Sanctions taken against offenders, should deter them from committing new
offenses (individualize preventive considerations), and deter others from committing offenses
(general deterrence considerations). Today's penalty level in Norway for many types of crimes so low that it does not
harmonize with population jurisprudence. We therefore higher penalties generally and
review of criminal laws. In addition, we want to introduce minimum penalties for some serious
crimes to ensure that the courts apportions penalties that are more in line with people's sense of justice than that
as is often the case today, as well as to remove the current volume discounts which means that criminals in a
trial sentenced for several conditions, not being punished for every one of the crimes he has
guilty of.
Today's court structure is not adapted to a modern rule of law and the requirements for specialized
expertise. With fewer things dishes can achieve greater expertise and greater opportunity
specialization of the individual judge. That way, the legal rights of every individual who is in contact
with the courts strengthened.
By increasingly adopting technology to the courts more efficient. Webcast should be introduced
in all things dishes, so you are better able to conduct remote meetings in confession cases, custody cases and other
types of cases where there appears to be important that an accused or indicted meetings personally.
Progress Party will keep the jury system. Summing up to the jury must be improved, and the jury must have the opportunity to
ask professional judges for input during the consultation. The Supreme Court shall have the opportunity to overrule the jury
decision in the question of guilt. In addition, it is important that all decisions must be substantiated so that the individual who
sentenced, should be able to know what has been decisive for his conviction.
We will tighten the limitation rules in the Criminal Code so that in fewer cases experiencing the perpetrator
can evade punishment. We want to change the system so that already sentenced not be barred. In cases
where the perpetrator is not convicted, shall obsolescence happen after 10 years of relationship with sentencing up to 6 years.
If the penalty is over 6 years shall the limitation period be 30 years. The most serious crimes
today has 21 years sentence, but that Progress will punish with up to 30 years shall not be
barred.
Progress will:

• streamline the courts and court processing
• develop the scheme for faster courts
• undergo criminal legislation to raise the penalties
• increase minimum penalties for serious offenses
• ensure independence of the courts
• remove the current volume discount by court for several offenses
• that all imposed imprisonment as a general rule shall be served in its entirety
• that the convicts are transferred directly from legal judgment for atonement
• review appeal system
• remove the limitation period where the indictment is crime against humanity
• remove the limitation period for offenses against children

Relatives and victim care
Progress will provide follow-up and assistance to those who are victims of crime. We believe that the current
system is structured so that the perpetrators have a larger public assistance than victims and their
relatives. We will create a special aftercare program for children who have been sexually abused.

31

Progress Party will ensure that the victim or his family gets paid any compensation from the State and that the State
Following shall levy the compensation from the perpetrator.
Progress will:
 establish an ombudsman for victims of crime
 that the victim and / or his or her family shall be entitled to offer follow-up
 that the victim and / or their relatives to be notified if the perpetrator should have leave from prison
 that the perpetrator may be imposed geographical restrictions for their leave to protect victim
and / or relatives
 review the legal rights of children after abuse

Preventive work
It is parents who are primarily responsible for following up their children. Nevertheless, it is necessary that
Public targeted focus on prevention. Some of the young people who come into a criminal
running track, have experienced an unsafe adolescence. It is important that public bodies that are in contact with children,
greater extent be able to detect when children are exposed to violence, abuse and other forms of
neglect.
Part of those who commit criminal acts, have extensive substance abuse. In the current system, they go out
and by treatment, and decide whether they are going to finish it. We want to allow compulsory treatment used
as a remedy when addicts convicted of crimes. This must be followed up by a comprehensive
program after completing treatment, so one can prevent relapse to substance abuse. Provisions should be made for
extending the use of compulsory treatment of drug abusers as an alternative to punishment. At the same time it must be
facilitate a comprehensive follow-up after completion of sentence.
Progress will:
 strengthen expertise in the health service, school, kindergarten, child welfare services and police, so that in
increasingly discovering children who are exposed to violence, abuse and other forms of neglect
 meeting young offenders with quick responses to prevent new offenses
 create a youth court and make sure it is set clear requirements for the individual when
sanction shall be implemented
 establish separate youth prisons so one mixing youth who have not developed an
extensive criminal career, with hardened criminals
 intervene early and have closely monitored by those who are trying to get into a criminal
tread
 strengthen cooperation between schools, child welfare and police
 enter for increased use of volunteers and non-profit organizations by prevention against
children and youth
 protect children against digital abuse

NORWAY AND THE WORLD
Limits are increasingly less in a globalized world. Globalization has led to differences between
between individuals and countries have been less. Never before have so many been lifted out of poverty. World
poor are not victims of globalization, but their problem is that they are excluded from the global market.
Norwegian foreign policy foremost task is to safeguard Norwegian interests. This must be done by grabbing the
positive opportunities that globalization offers and protect effectively against the threats it brings with it. Norwegian
interests is best secured through binding international cooperation aimed at international
32

annealing, lasting peace, the freest possible world trade and respect for fundamental human rights.
In this work, NATO and the EU constitute the pillars.
Foreign representation must be proportionate to Norwegian interests in the individual countries, and in particular aim at
assist businesses and Norwegian nationals.
Conditions to other countries must be based on the principles of equality and free trade. Free trade is the best form
for global division of labor with the mutual benefits of trade. Norway should therefore urgently downsize
trade barriers against other countries. Aid as a state compulsory scheme should be reduced. Norway must naturally
provide emergency and disaster aid through national and international organizations.
The Progress Party believes it is important to build alliances with like-minded countries and support
democratic right of states to defend themselves against terrorism and threats from neighboring countries. We support the Jewish
people's right to a national homeland in Israel. The State of Israel is recognized as a sovereign and democratic state
with the right to protect its citizens against external, existential threats.

Northern Areas
North has in recent years become more and more interesting for Norway as well as for the world. The increased
interest is due to the large amounts of natural resources have been found, and they would expect to find in
future. Besides changing ice in the Arctic Ocean itself so that new sea routes opened up, and this means shorter
distance between the eastern and western markets.
In light of these developments, Norway must clearly assert its sovereignty in our parts of the northern areas
through development, emergency and defense. Progress will develop this region for the benefit of all
nation, and take responsibility for a sensible, forward-looking and responsible development.
During increased activity in the northern areas, Norges responsibility for preparedness in all areas grow. Sailing via
Northeast Passage and the Arctic Ocean makes Norway's gateway to the entire European market, and that all
transportation from Europe through these lanes will pass us. This fact means that we must be able to
handle major disasters in Norwegian responsibilities, both in terms of recovery of people, ships,
systems and values. At the same time we have to have an oil spill of the highest standard to
secure us against significant negative environmental impacts.
This will also pave the way for the development of port facilities and associated infrastructure in the north, also on Svalbard
placed right in the area. It will in this connection be necessary to consider whether one can
maintain strict restrictions around Svalbard, or whether technological progress makes these
can be softened.
Norway's share of North contains a huge amount of natural resources in the form of fish and shellfish,
oil, gas and minerals. Pure and unspoiled nature, access to renewable energy sources and a unique flora and fauna
also represents great potential for growth and development. We will facilitate all these opportunities can
used, and will also emphasize innovation and research that promotes coexistence of industries.
We consider Norway's responsibility as a stable petroleum supplier to be very important, and will therefore open new
areas north of mining and exploration activity within the tight security rules we already have.
We believe that a strong and operatively defenses in northern areas is a necessity to promote Norwegian
sovereignty and ownership of the riches contained therein. We will thus seek to strengthen all
Armed to the north, as well as encourage increased allied exercise and activity. In addition, border control against
east enforced strictly, but effectively with regard to trade and cooperation.
Progress will:
 promote our ownership in northern areas
 strengthen all branches of the military in the north

Norway and Europe
Progress has individual freedom and self-determination as an essential objective. Means in
efforts to reach this goal is the reduction or abolition of obstacles to human expression,
diligence and realization of own goals. Such obstacles may be a result of state power is too
extensive. It may also be due to national boundaries by protectionist character, which excludes
people and companies from cooperating across borders.
Although there are major challenges related to transparency, voluntariness and free movement of capital, business and
people on a global basis, we see a number of positive developments in regional areas. In Europe
that area, we will work for a liberalization of the economy to promote growth and prosperity. The
Efforts should be made to associate Norway closer to Europe and seek supranational solutions when it comes to questions
on security policy, environmental policy, criminal policy and political areas that strongly relate to
free trade, competition rules and human freedom.
EEA agreement secures Norwegian access to the EU internal market, and is of vital importance for Norwegian industry. The
importance of predictability and clear rules for trade in the EEA. Progress Party will work to improve
EEA agreement with a view to securing Norwegian interests. The agreement must be in certain respects be more strictly enforced and about
necessary renegotiated. This applies particularly in areas related to export / access to Norwegian
welfare benefits.
External Schengen border is under strong pressure, and several Schengen countries have little ability to control their own
perimeter, with the consequences that people uncontrollably flowing illegally into the Schengen area. This
the problem must be grasped hold of and resolved, if the contract will be continued in its current form.
Developments in EU raises several questions of great importance for Norway. How the debt crisis will affect the EU
thus Norway in the longer term is uncertain. Both the political and the economic integration in the EU
has received a strong backlash that undermines the EU's foundations. Schengen Agreement, which has removed
border control in each country, and replaced this with an outer border to the entire area, has proved
having their weaknesses.
The Norwegian people have twice said no to Norwegian EU membership and we will respect this popular will.
The only thing that might change this, is the result of a new referendum. In the debate for or against
Membership prepared our elected freely and they are treated equally regardless of position. Congress will
loyally follow up the outcome of a possible new referendum.
Progress will:
 respect people's vision of a possible new referendum on Norwegian EU membership
 remove special Norwegian rules including prohibiting the importation of products that are legal in EU
 work to develop a good working relationship with the EU and the individual member states
 point out that the Norwegian exports of oil and gas deals with important national resources to be
be subject to Norwegian law and jurisdiction
 pursue measures to ensure a better preparedness for dealing with banking and debt crisis in Europe and
large fluctuations in the international economy
 raise the threshold to take part in the Norwegian welfare benefits associated with increased labor from EU
 continuously evaluate whether Norway is served by continued membership in Schengen

34

Development policy
Developing countries must be given the opportunity for economic development. They must therefore be allowed to export their
goods to Norway unhampered by restrictions, quotas, duties and taxes. We can not accept a development policy
which is to develop a production system in poor countries, then to restrict the flow of goods from the
same countries. The state should facilitate that Norwegian businesses can establish themselves in poor countries. It is
through expanded trade with the poor countries we can give our best contribution.
The experiences with the Norwegian aid policy shows that aid has not given the desired results. Countries like
has received most Norwegian assistance, has become completely dependent on aid, and aid has slowed required
economic and democratic reforms in developing countries. Research indicates that foreign aid money
can reinforce corruption in poor countries, since it is more profitable to work to get more assistance than
create their own values.
As long as it is not possible to get a majority to limit the state aid, we will work to ensure that the
assistance given shall receive the greatest possible effect. Today's assistance, according to financial experts small or
no effect in the recipient countries because development aid given to the countries with the worst economic
policy. Assistance should be channeled to those countries that are actively working to open to free trade, abolish
price regulation and are willing to balance their national budgets. Assistance should also be concentrated
thematically and geographically so that we can manage it well. It is also essential to encourage an effective
agricultural production, so that hunger can be prevented and drought disasters can be prevented.
The NGOs do much good. At the same time that the administrative costs constitute a
disproportionate share of total expenditure. It would be natural to set requirements for the volunteers
organizations deductible. The Progress Party wants to facilitate increasing the tax deduction for gifts for volunteers,
social and humanitarian organizations.
A reorganization of aid policy in this direction will require a review and adjustment of
funding agencies. It applies Norad, Norfund, Innovation Norway and the newly created Export Credits
Norway. In addition, the Norwegian Guarantee Institute for Export Credits play a central role. Through these, the state
primarily to take a monitoring and oversight and ensure that the private sector's efforts happening after
firmly established ethical guidelines and support the fight against corruption.
The bulk of Norwegian aid should be concentrated on development of business, formalizing
ownership and the establishment of property registers. It must establish a robust national bank and a stable,
convertible currency in the individual countries. Furthermore, it is important to help build out the water and
energy production and distribution for this, as well as roads and ports. The fight against corruption and for
rule of law and human rights must be central. With a stable economy makes it easier to develop
healthcare and education at all levels.
Developing countries repaying more debt than what is given in aid. Therefore, debt forgiveness be to
great help to achieve the desired development. However, it must be possible to set requirements for countries receiving debt remitted.
Each country's work for democracy and market economy, and work against corruption will be important
criteria.
It should also be considered to freeze debt for a limited period for individual countries affected by major
natural disasters such as floods drought etc. so that the country can use the resources to save life and health of their
citizens.
Progress will:
 limit state aid
 introducing free trade by dismantling the import restrictions including limits developing countries
 encourage voluntary assistance through humanitarian organizations
 provide assistance to countries that freely come in need by natural disasters and similar, for example,
by freezing lending commitments to Norway
 prevent Norwegian assistance helps to corruption

channeling aid to countries that actively works to open to free trade and who are willing to

threats from other countries

Human rights
The Progress Party's liberal worldview assumes that all people have certain universal freedoms and
rights regardless of where in the world they live, such as freedom of expression, religious freedom and protection of private
ownership. This means that we will work to spread knowledge of human rights and combat violence
and oppression, such as female genital mutilation, forced marriage, trafficking and sexual abuse
of children.
Dialogue is not always sufficient. In such cases, it would be most appropriate to stand together with others
Democratic allies to put pressure on single countries.
Sometimes it is irresponsible to maintain economic relations and contact with the individual states. We will
therefore support international boycotts and sanctions against states that consistently breaks
human rights in a particularly brutal manner or behind or finance terrorist activities in other
countries.
UN should concentrate on preventive war and peacemaking, humanitarian and emergency efforts
and protection of human rights. The organization and its sub-organizations have developed large
bureaucracies with enormous administrative costs. Progress will seek to ensure that the organization and
its sub-organizations must be reorganized and rationalized and that the extent of costly global and
regional conferences is limited. In addition, dictatorial states great influence and hinder efforts to
stop war and oppression. Norway should take the initiative for a fundamental debate in the UN about the relationship
between the United Nations, international law and totalitarian states. Norway should work to ensure that countries that consistently suppresses
their citizens fundamental rights, not be accommodated in the committees and commissions of the United Nations which has as its
The primary task of promoting such rights.
Progress will:
•
prioritize work for universal acceptance of human rights
•
ensure greater focus on human rights and democratic principles as part of
integration efforts
•
that the United Nations will be streamlined and focus on peacemaking operations, humanitarian and
crisis efforts and prevent persistent serious violations of fundamental human rights.

Foreign Affairs
Progress will strengthen the Foreign Ministry's organization and expertise within selected
areas and downsize the organization and use of resources within policy areas considered less
important. The consular services will be reviewed with a view to provide more effective assistance to
Norwegian enterprises and Norwegian citizens abroad.
Emergency preparedness will be reviewed with the aim of a higher operational readiness and organization, as well
better coordination with various ministries and other agencies. It will be carried out an evaluation and prepared
a new and action-oriented plan for Northern Areas initiative. Coordination between Foreign and
Ministry of Defence and the interface between defense and security will be separately
reviewed with a view at any time to ensure the best possible match between the long-term security needs, and
current defense structure. We also want a more proactive trade policy to better safeguard
market access for Norwegian export products.
Progress will:
36

 modernize, streamline and strengthen the Ministry's organization in accordance with the priorities of the
foreign policy.

Norwegians abroad
Progress notes that many and increasing numbers, Norwegians decide to move permanently or to stay
longer abroad. Especially many retirees, both disability and old-age pensioners, select this with a view
salutary effects due to climate. But we also see an increase in people in work choose to stay completely
or in part in other countries. This involves some issues, both in terms of social security benefits,
care, rehabilitation and fiscal matters.
Far too many have been put in an impossible situation due to inadequate answers from different public
offices. We note including a discrimination from the Tax Office and Population Registry depending on
where the office had to lie. It is therefore necessary to ensure that NAV International is able to provide
necessary and correct information to all. We will therefore in the period undertake a thorough review of
international agreements and Norwegian laws, with a view to create conditions more conducive to Norwegians
abroad.
Progress Party believes the fundamentals must be that taxes only to one country, and that it is in the country one taxes to,
one should possess and acquire further rights.
This means that you either are taxable in Norway and pay ordinary tax hit, or you're liable to tax in
country they have moved to. Shall not be imposed withholding tax on pensions to Norwegians who are tax
expat.
Pension benefits are individually acquired rights. These should not be reduced, even though the pensioner
choose to settle in countries with lower cost levels than Norway.
Norwegians living abroad but who have rights to the Norwegian health care through voluntary
participation in national insurance, or because they are not yet tax resident in, given the opportunity to reside
in Norway beyond fixed periods of time if they are to receive necessary health care.
Progress will:
 consider central tax issues
 improve approval procedures when it comes to benefits abroad
 ensure greater expertise by NAV International
 oppose any form of double taxation of expatriate Norwegians
 the earned pension is treated as a personal right, which can be freely taken out of
landed
 undergo customs and excise regulations for home moving to Norway

Immigration
With immigrants, we understand people who come to Norway to seek long-term stay. With refugees
we understand people who meet the requirements UN Refugee Convention set to give the right to stay in
Norway. Asylum seekers are people who even seek Norway to seek asylum. Asylum seekers who are rejected, is to
regarded as illegal immigrants. People who receive residence permits as part of family reunification
or on humanitarian grounds, is for the Progress Party believes not refugees but immigrants.

37

Social benefits
The main principle of the Progress Party's immigration policy is equal treatment where no group is given
preferential treatment. It must be emphasized that all those who have legal residence in Norway shall be ensured a fair
treatment. Employees with foreign citizenship must have the right and duty to earning
pension under the National Insurance Scheme, and the right to health care. More social benefits must be granted under
condition that immigrants are willing to integrate themselves and learn Norwegian.
Social benefits should be more closely linked to citizenship or other appropriate refinements.
It is a government responsibility to receive refugees, and therefore the state should also cover documented expenses up
seven years when refugees are deployed in the municipalities. Today many municipalities that integration grants
do not cover the actual costs of receiving and integrating refugees.
Special arrangements with benefits for immigrants should cease.
It is the municipality itself to decide whether it is ready to accept refugees. The municipality undertakes
to follow up the refugees so that they become integrated into the local community.

Family reunification
The possibility of family immigration is limited to a spouse over 24 years and their children under 18 years.
Family reunification for a spouse should only be granted if the couple does not have greater overall association with
any other country than Norway. Adults applying for family reunification must have earned
satisfactory knowledge of the Norwegian language and society before an application for family can
treated. People from the EEA and some other countries may be exempted from the stricter requirements
family. It should be able to require DNA tests to prove kinship.
The Progress Party believes people who have come to Norway through family reunification shall not be entitled
additional family reunion. Persons seeking to be reunited with family from the country of origin or from
third countries, must have received a permanent residence permit in Norway

Labour
Basically, Norway should meet the need for labor within their own populations. This can be taken
for by making arrangements that stimulate people's willingness to work, for example by putting down the tax burden
and get more benefit recipients into work. Needs beyond this can largely be covered by manpower from the EEA. It should be possible to procure labor outside the European Economic Area, based primarily on
ACCR contracts.

Refugees
Progress wants Norway to fulfill their international obligations and assist refugees.
Refugees, however, can best be helped in their geographical and cultural vicinity. Instead of taking many
Refugees in Norway, Norway should make a greater contribution to cover the costs of refugee reception in
refugees own neighborhood. It will provide assistance and security to far more people in such areas for
the same amount as it would cost to have one refugee in Norway.
Integration policy considerations should be based on any selection of quota refugees.

Asylum seekers
There is reason to fear that a continued immigration of asylum seekers, of only approximately the extent that one
had in recent years, will lead to serious contradictions between population groups in Norway. There are ethical
irresponsible not to tighten this immigration to prevent conflicts in the Norwegian society.
38

Progress will pursue a restrictive policy when it comes to admit asylum. Asylum Research is a very
important tool for providing protection to people who are genuinely threatened, and should not be misused in any form.
Asylum status to be granted only for individual treatment and thorough assessment of applications.
Anke Possibilities for rejection for residence shall in principle be limited to an appellate court. To safeguard
security of asylum seekers, there should be opened for the use of closed asylum centers. There must be a clear
assumption that refugees and asylum seekers who have been granted residence permit in Norway, to be repatriated to their
respective homelands when circumstances render it unsafe.
To a false identity to the Norwegian authorities is to be considered as a crime that qualifies for
expulsion. Forced return of rejected asylum seekers can take place to the country of origin, believed
of origin or another country in the region concerned is believed to have cultural affiliation.
Norway should negotiate return agreements with a number of countries, and this may be connected to the general
aid policy.
The processing time for asylum applications must be reduced. It is not acceptable that people should reside in refugee centers
several years while they stand in line at the immigration administration. This is especially important when children are involved.
Asylum applications should be processed within a maximum of six months, and asylum seekers will sit in closed
reception centers pending the completed application and clarified identity. Progress Party believes the current organization of
immigration authorities into two administrative bodies is inconvenient and want your complaints in immigration cases should
finally treated in a separate administrative tribunal.

Integration
Progress basic attitude is equal treatment of Norwegians and immigrants. Everyone should have the same
rights and obligations in relation to their community in Norway, regardless of ethnic background. A restrictive
immigration policy with active integration and adaptation to Norwegian society will prevent
contradictions and conflicts.
The making demands of immigrants, is to show them respect. By requiring immigrants to
conducting Norwegian and social studies education and job training as a condition for getting public
benefits, communication between Norwegians and immigrants and between immigrants from different
origin, ensured by Norwegian become a common language for all. We believe the status of courses in Norwegian and
Civics must be raised significantly, so that those who have successfully completed meetings a working and
society that takes them good.
Good knowledge of Norwegian is also an important basis for immigrants to join the labor market,
thereby making it possible to achieve an extraordinary career.
To become a Norwegian citizen and to get voting rights, it should primarily be a requirement to self-sufficiency capability,
social understanding and sufficient knowledge of Norwegian. There must also be a requirement to a minimum of ten years of residence,
from the date of granting of applications for residence permits. If the applicant is married to Norwegian
citizen, the requirement of residence at least five years.
Progress will:
 Norges receiving people from countries outside the western world narrowed sharply
 introducing an active integration policy based on Norwegian rules, norms and values
 the criteria for granting asylum shall be strictly construed and that immigration stop effectively enforced
 introduce municipal veto against the establishment of reception centers
 restrict family reunification scheme to a spouse over 24 years and their children under 18 years
 that those who come to Norway as a result of family reunification are not given the right to new or upgraded
family.
 introducing language and knowledge tests as adult family immigrants must pass in their home country before they
can stay in Norway
 respect for the church space, but do not accept the church asylum
39




the reception and settlement of refugees must be decided by each municipality
critically through public support to organizations and associations where ethnic background or
common homeland is a criterion for membership and for the organization's platform
tightening up the rules for carriers who bring asylum seekers without identity papers to Norway
that immigrants and asylum seekers who come from areas with high risk of disease, undergoing a
mandatory health checks

DEFENCE AND SECURITY
Protecting public safety is one of the state's basic tasks, and the original
reason why states were formed.
The defense policy shall always be designed on the basis of the security situation. Armed Forces
structure and organization must therefore be determined by developments in the threats and long-term security policy
needs and not a predetermined cost as is the case today. Progress considering Norway
security situation from different aspects and criteria. The basic relationship is Norway
geopolitical location where one is between the US, Russia and the European continent.
Historically, it has been of interest to warring parties to use bases on Norwegian soil in connection
with the game on sea routes in the North Atlantic. The parties have also wanted to prevent the enemy from establishing
corresponding bases.
After the Soviet Union dissolved, the relative importance of the northern areas increasing for Russia.
This is also apparent from the increased Russian military activity along the Norwegian coast in recent years. In addition to
the important fishery resources in the region are revealed large and valuable deposits of oil and gas in
waters off northern Norway and Russia. Border, sovereignty and responsibilities in these
areas must be clarified in order to reduce the risk of conflict and crisis. Norway must initially be
dealing with a crisis in the northern regions with their own resources.
Defense planning must be organized in recognition of the defense structures is time-consuming to change,
but security picture can change quickly. All historical experience shows that military conflicts arise suddenly
and surprising. The structures and capacities that are built up, must therefore be flexible and contain a
element of the cover relative to the current threat level during periods of low voltage.
The new security picture is additionally influenced by international terrorism, proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and unpredictable threats. Threat assessments over the last 3-4 years show that Norway is
deferred and that the threat level is raised.
Terrorism, on the other side together nations that previously stood against each other. Nations are now more
keen to ensure their own safety, and to create relationships with other countries to ensure a broad front against
terror. It is important that Norway takes active part in the fight against terrorism with the participation of international cooperation
and international operations.
Globalization has also given new challenges such as the spread of epidemic diseases, organized
Crime and religious fundamentalism. Distances are shorter and trade has increased. This has made
us more vulnerable as individual states and individuals.

Alliance Politics - NATO
NATO is the cornerstone of Norway's security and defense policy anchor. Norway should actively stimulate
joint training and exercises within NATO and with forces from European countries.
40

NATO's focus has lately turned more towards the safety of NATO's neighboring areas, and it is in
Norway's interest to further develop and strengthen this tendency. We want to increase the presence of and training for
Allied forces in Norway.
Bilateral amplification agreements will continue to be a vital part of Norwegian security policy. The
is particularly important to continue and develop the strategic partnership with our most important ally, the United States, but
also with other key allies. An important element of such a partnership is prominent storage of American
military equipment and related agreements. It is also important to continue the American training and
exercise activities in Norway, as well as having an effective intelligence cooperation.
USA dishes increasingly political and military attention on other areas and reduce inter alia
its presence in Europe. This means that we increasingly self must be prepared to protect our
Safety.
North Sea strategy covers the UK, Netherlands, Germany, Norway and Denmark, and involves increased
focus on multinational solutions for procurement, operations and maintenance, command and control,
education, training and exercises, and operations for all branches of the military. This need for the Progress Party
opinion should not break with our cooperation with the United States.
Through EU membership and participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace (PFP) have Sweden and Finland's
security policy platform. The development of the Swedish and Finnish defense will continue to be of great
significance for Norway. The new situation provides opportunities for increased cooperation between our countries' defense
as a supplement to our NATO membership, but may not constitute a substitute for this.
Cooperation with other nations, however, must not cause us to make us rely on these to safeguard
our key security interests.
Progress will:
 ensure continued Norwegian membership and influence in NATO through active participation in the political and
military forums
 ensure a continued strong alliance with the United States as our closest of allies
 ensure that allies still use Norway as rehearsal countries and encourage our key allies
presetting on Norwegian soil

The Norwegian defense
The threat can be changed faster than our ability to defend ourselves. We must therefore be able to defend the
values ​​we stand for and the values ​​we administer. Conscription applies to all Norwegian citizens.
Norway's ability to deal with a possible invasion or military action against Norwegian territory is weakened.
It is essential that this capability is recovered. The overall defense structure must be seen in relation to new
threats. Other threats to more urban areas and infrastructure, as well as oil installations, etc. have
emphasized.
The Armed Forces must be able to handle both threats and challenges to our territory, special objects and
installations as well as a wide range of terrorist threats. This will demand that the defense of all times
prepared to quickly move units to areas subject to threats or actions. In addition to
flexibility and availability is also crucial that the military is present in significantly greater extent in
North. Presence signals both willingness and ability to protect our interests.
Defense should also be prepared to reinforce capacity during crises.
Training of officers takes many years, and the officer corps are Defence's most important resource. Education, training and
use must be given priority so that officers are able to fulfill their role in war organization and in international
41

service. Military have a job that puts special demands and where they are exposed to special loads.
It should therefore introduced a scheme for specialist officers and NCOs in line with NATO standards. The
This also means that the state is obliged to safeguard the special needs. Exceptions to laws and regulations in the workplace can
be necessary, but these should be compensated financially.
Veterans have undertaken extraordinary burdens on society. This must be recognized, and
Veterans specific needs for monitoring shall be ensured.
Home Guard is an important part of the Norwegian defense. Home Guard can to a far greater extent than currently used
to solve different tasks in different parts of the country, in cooperation with the police. Several of these tasks will require
new equipment and new skills. It will also require officers with varied expertise.
Conscription and military service is a basic foundation of our defense. This gives access to the
chief of Norwegian youth, and is a good recruitment base for future careers in the military. Conscription gives
also defense a grounding in all the people, contributing vital to the defense will, and shows that the defense of
the country is a basic and common task. Cooperation with organizations that contribute to the defense capability
and willingness to proceed. In particular, cooperation with reserve officers emphasized.
Progress will:
 ensure that the Armed Forces at all times have the necessary materials and competent personnel to solve imposed
tasks
 ensure that the Armed Forces through military service, military service and recruiting a sufficient
recruitment basis for solving assigned tasks
 ensure that the officer corps gets predictable working and educational programs, the additional responsibilities given
reasonable compensation, and ensure that the officiating gets better financial allowances
 that financial constraints and staffing must be sized according to tasks
 increase endurance and capacity of the Army by utilizing reserve forces better
 reconsider the current arrangement where the Chief of Defence is integrated with the Ministry of Defence
 improve the ability of information warfare
 reduce support functions to improve operational capability
 ensure a large and stable presence of military forces in northern areas
 that Defence resources flexible to be able to support other agencies in emergencies, but this will not go on
expense of the Armed primary tasks
 continue efforts procurement of submarines
 ensure a modern combat aircraft guns, but financing of new fighter aircraft must not be at the expense of
other operations and exercises.
 that preparedness and response is improved and that our forces are effectively available when needed
 ensure adequate training standards among both duty and reserve forces
 reestablishing effort forces capacity in the National Guard
 ensure adequate training standards and readiness in the National Guard
 establish a broad-based National Security Council aimed at the most efficient running
managing the interface between security and defense policy, and between professional military advice
and political decisions.
 that greater investment must be financed outside the regular defense budget

International operations
The Progress Party believes Norway should actively contribute forces in peacekeeping and peacemaking
operations. The assumption is that the mandates are designed so that the force is able to solve quests,
and that they are time-limited. The costs of such operations should also be granted separately.
Norway should primarily participate in international operations based on resolutions of the UN Security Council. Humanitarian
considerations may however indicate that Norway also supports operations led by NATO or coalition forces, even
42

though these because of the veto power is not approved by the UN Security Council. Norway will have outside help, we must
Also be willing to help out. International operations also provide valuable experience for Norwegian military
personnel.
Personnel who voluntarily sign a contract for participation in the Norwegian contingents to international forces
UN and / or NATO must be able to obtain contracts of more than one year, and have the opportunity to further
contract renewal at the suitability and needs. This will ensure greater proportion of more experienced and mature
personnel in the forces which will operate in conjunction with other foreign forces in international
operations.
Collaboration with foreign allied forces through joint training, operations and armaments cooperation is
essential to ensure high quality of Norwegian contributions to international operations. Norwegian forces abroad
have further ensured the necessary and appropriate military equipment, including armored vehicles that make it
possible to carry out missions in an effective, safe and appropriate manner.
It is important that society gives veterans the recognition they deserve for the work they do on behalf
by the Norwegian government.
Injured veterans and their dependents shall be given follow-up and support so that they do not experience bureaucracy and
red tape as an additional workload. Norwegian soldiers who are mentally or physically injured in the service of
Norway, should be looked after both medically and financially, and they should be offered personalized follow-up in relation
employment or education.
Progress will work for the establishment of a satisfactory compensation scheme for those who did not
can be rehabilitated completely, so these should be able to maintain a decent life.

Terror - Civil
The new security policy picture is characterized by international terrorism, proliferation of
WMD and unpredictable threats. This will also affect Norway and Norwegian interests
abroad.
Developments in society with new forms of risk, vulnerability and threats demand new vigilance and ever
adaptation of safety and readiness of the top administrative and political leadership. It is laying
major challenges in areas including information and communication technology,
energy supply, transport, supplies, oil and gas, infection control and water supply.
It is necessary with stronger focus on all aspects of social security. We will therefore work actively
that Norway should be able to meet the new threats through good contingency plans, necessary
protective equipment, material and personnel.
It is necessary to have close cooperation and coordinated efforts from the security services, police,
municipalities, industry and defense. Nationally, it is basically a police mission to combat
terrorism. Defense must nevertheless be prepared to support, complement or take over police duties
extraordinary situations. Use of military forces domestically in peacetime will only occur on the order of
police or other authorities. Resources and personnel should be applied flexibly between agencies.

Civil Emergency
It is important to have a sufficiently developed civil defense, when disasters, terrorism, armed conflict and war will
Frame civilians greatly. Armed Forces will support civil society in emergencies and be trained
for this purpose as part of the total defense effort. Furthermore, an arrangement where both the defense and civil
actors performing the rescue, lead to enhanced quality. The consideration of what produces the best results, should be
guideline, therefore we will work actively for a nationwide service.

43

The modern Norway is vulnerable and very robust. Conducted vulnerability analyzes have traded in priority
aims to reduce the impact of increased vulnerability. It must increasingly be taken into account present and future
technology in emergency context. It is therefore necessary to ensure important public functions
against terrorism, organized crime, international hacking mm Progress will work
a strong and dynamic combination of civil and military resources and measures.
Increased transport of oil from Northwest Russia, as well as increased oil production in the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea
require a strengthening of the oil spill in these waters. Coast Guard and Air Force have important
oil spill response functions in northern waters. It must ensure a proper financing of these tasks
all along the Norwegian coast.
The Progress Party believes that the Directorate for Civil Protection and Emergency Planning (DSB), like
OAG should get a supervisory and control role against public administration. This includes state,
county, municipalities and Government. DSB will report directly to Parliament.
Civil Defence is a very important part of civil emergency planning. Civil Defence is an important support for
emergency services in addition to that there is a major emergency agency. Progress Party will strengthen Civil Defence with modern equipment
and better opportunity for exercises alone and with the emergency services. We will also consider Civil Defence
administrative affiliation and alternative organization outside the DSB.
Voluntary response organizations must increasingly stimulated. These have high sector knowledge and
general community emergency preparedness important. Moms- and tax relief is important and good stimuli. It lives
be the State's responsibility to cover lost earnings when volunteers exploration crews are out on assignment.
Progress Party will facilitate annual practice interactions with health care, fire brigade, defense and police.

FAMILY POLICY
For Progress is the family a natural, valuable and fundamental element forming important
frames for children's upbringing and future. We consider the family to be a very important tradition history and
culture bearer, and believes that family's position in Norwegian society will be strengthened rather than the public sector in
increasingly want to make decisions for the family.
Initially and premise of any family relationship is that it is based on voluntariness. Children are entitled
to both their parents, and parents must be at breakups equated in their rights and duties.
All couples have the right to organize themselves in a way they find best. Those choosing cohabitation as
its form, must also arrange to secure the necessary rights. Progress Party strongly opposes marriage
entered into under duress.
High taxes means that both parents usually must have remunerative work to
maintain the general standard of living. Through reductions in taxes and more flexible
working arrangements, made it easier to combine family life, caring for children, the sick or the elderly
family members, with work.
Maternity leave should be continued, with an independent vesting and withdrawal right of parental benefits.
Who parent should be at home with your child and how long is determined by the parents themselves. By
toddlers adoption applies the same rules to leave the maternity.

44

The family should increasingly be able to adapt and crannies from the individual family's needs. We will
therefore toddlers period prioritize freedom of choice by offering a greater variety of flexible and alternative
kindergartens.
The Progress Party wants it to be a diversity in the educational programs in kindergartens, and we ask ourselves
therefore positive for literacy in kindergartens. Good basic manning and a stable
staffing situation is a prerequisite for good nurseries.
We will legislate the right to day care of the child is one year, regardless of when in the year the child is born.
Public and private kindergartens given genuine equal treatment.
Government cash replaced by a municipal cash benefit for parents who want or need
alternatives to kindergarten. Child benefit shall be annually indexed.
One must distinguish between children's education and children's leisure. Skolefritidsordningen may advantageously be left to
private providers or NGOs.

Child welfare
It is always the parents' responsibility and obligation to give children the confidence, care and love they need
to grow up to become independent and responsible individuals. The reality is unfortunately not always so.
Therefore, we must have good arrangements that protect and help those families and children who need it.
We want to strengthen child protection and will introduce a sharing service. One part will be called preventive
Family counseling. The preventive cooperation must be organized in close interaction between the family, healthcare,
schools, kindergartens and other relevant government agencies. The idea is to find solutions and measures that make
the need for a relocation reduced or eliminated.
Sometimes it will be necessary to take the child out of the home, only then enters into CPS. When trades
it is about protecting children's rights, even if it comes at the expense of the adult's interests and
convenience. The CPS must always engage and assess immediate family and family
networks that your child already knows, such as foster care and child to participate and have an influence on it
that concern them. The CPS shall implement measures to ensure care of children's rights, while
that CPS ensures that the offer being made, is better than the child came from.
Replacement of officers within the family / child welfare should be a right for citizens, as this may
restrict matters concerning care if it only proves that cooperation is difficult.
The CPS should not carry one chats with children in matters relating to violence / sexual abuse when
leading questions can mislead children to create a false truth. A person who is not working on it
should be present. Such calls should be recorded on tape.
Progress Party believes that oversight arrangements must be changed. An inspection must be built on basic trust. Progress Party will introduce a
scheme trustees for all placed children in child welfare.
Children with complex problems require multiple services, then you have these services cooperate. We will
strengthen both children and their parents' legal rights, while we will give children the right to refuse visitation with
their biological parents, if this is a danger to the child or the child's desire. We will abolish the
dual responsibilities and financing form that child welfare today are subject.
Physical and psychological abuse, including female genital mutilation of children, are serious violations. Such misuse must
fought with far greater resources than hitherto, and penalties must be sharpened. To get stopped
FGM is the most important measure to introduce mandatory gynecological examinations for all children
risk groups. Violence and sexual abuse cases against children should always be a priority.
Progress will:
45

that access will be emphasized in the calculation of child support
that all approved nurseries shall be treated equally from the public
that children's rights should be strengthened
that the breakup equated parents' rights and duties
equate approved care forms
that public support to a greater extent given that the tax credit
liquidate county boards

Alone Boere
Very many people in Norway live alone for various reasons. That means they only have one income to be
cover costs for housing and other needs.
Progress Party believes that the fees and charges associated with the housing to the extent possible should be differentiated, in that it is payable
for metered consumption, and not according to stipulated consumption based on the dwelling area.
Because of the generally high cost levels, experiencing many single households that they are in a financial
demanding situation. Progress want the greatest extent possible political solutions that are general, but
which would safeguard the interests of different groups of people. We will for example:
- Reduce electricity tax
- Reduce the income tax
- Reduce car taxes
- Reduce demands for equity financing of housing
- Increase the housing, this will lead to lower house prices
- Removing the requirement of the Planning and Building Act, which will lead to lower housing prices
- Removing property tax
- Discontinue the NRK license
For single households, these measures will collectively help to better purchasing power and greater economic freedom.

HEALTH AND CARE
All welfare benefits that people are entitled to different life, work and health situations, closely linked
and engages partially into each other. To ensure a good interaction and provide solutions that are both the best
and the most economically sensible, all expenses are collected in the same budget and the same administrative level.
Progress will therefore collect all welfare spending in the state, making it unworthy game in which the state and
municipalities attempting to topple spending over one another, ceases.
That the state to cover the cost of welfare, health and care, requiring neither public
service provision or waiver of diversity and competition between different service providers.
Therefore, perform a welfare reform with a clear organizational distinction between bestiller- and
payment function on the one hand, and service production on the other. The principle must be that the state
pay for the service on behalf of the person who is assigned to a service, so that the user chooses
service producer.
The current situation with long queues health is not acceptable. The capacity of the health system, both public and
private, must be used so that the queues can be removed. This applies both within hospitals,
substance abuse care, rehabilitation, psychiatry and municipal care. Availability abroad should also
could be used.
46

Production of welfare services differs little from other services. To ensure good quality and proper
quantity should all service providers are treated equally by ordering / paying liable regardless of whether they are private
or publicly operated. Such equal treatment will stimulate creativity and competition to be the best at
quality.
For users to be able to make good and right decisions, it is important to develop
quality indicators. This means that both latency, achievement, risk of infection, the number of versions with
more can be based on patient choice. It should also developed a system in which patients can provide
feedback about their experiences, so this could be the basis for learning in health and other
patients' assessment.
To ensure a proper quality of all services and, in both public and private, should be done
by independent supervision.
We want a holistic approach to society's total expenses. It is unnecessary that the public must
pay out sickness benefits for people on the waiting list for easy processing, if there is spare capacity to get
processing performed. We will give priority to faster processing, to get people back to work earlier.
Companies within the current system pays for necessary medical treatment for their employees, should receive
deduction for this tax. No one should rather be in favor taxed to receive necessary medical care.
The Progress Party wants a diverse healthcare where patients' safety and freedom of choice safeguarded. We are also open to
medications and therapies outside the traditional scientific medicine. Where positive effects can
documented, we will increasingly be able to open for public funding.
There are many seriously ill and dying people who do not receive the necessary care and assistance in life last
phase. The Progress Party is keen to strengthen this offer for both adults and children, and is of the opinion that
establishment of hospice places could improve the quality of the offer in terms of providing comprehensive care in an environment
characterized by peace, dignity and time for both patient and family. We will therefore facilitate the establishment of
hospice providing great offers across the country.

Elderly
For Progress trades elderly about people who because of illness or impairment
combined with aging, need for treatment, care and / or practical assistance. Age is thus not a
independent criterion in this context.
There is a public task to organize and finance care for the elderly. A good geriatric care should not
depend on the good or bad municipal. We will, therefore, that the State should have the financial responsibility
for elderly care, and that both public and private actors should be able to compete on equal terms
regarding service. Elderly should be provided based on the principle that all people are equal and should
have respect for individual dignity.
Older requiring care must have the opportunity to live at home as long as they want, as long as it is justifiable. In order to
Achieving this must be facilitated for good home care. We want user choice on home care and
home care, so that the elderly should be able to choose the service provider who will come home to them,
and deselect offers they are dissatisfied with.
We want a carer scheme for the whole country so in need of care can also choose one of their nearest
to perform the services.
It is well documented that preventive home visits have led to improved quality of life, improved
disability, fewer hospital admissions, and lower mortality in the elderly. Therefore, we will introduce Deals
the outreach preventive home care for people over 75 years.
47

The Progress Party wants a stronger focus on everyday rehabilitation. When a user reports a need for assistance from
the public, it must be inserted into the resources necessary to get the user to be the most self-reliant
again. We would particularly focus on training and rehabilitation in home care services, in addition to ordinary care.
Some older people are lonely and feel insecure by staying at home even though they have daily supervision of
home care services. Many still have a functional level that allows nursing home is not the right
offer. We will facilitate modern retirement offers, Care +, for those who are too healthy for a
nursing home, but who feel lonely and insecure by staying home. This should not be
institutions, but homes that are leased or owned by residents, and where the social environment is an important factor.
It shall be limited staffing related to Care +.
The sickest seniors must be secured nursing home placement. We see that there is a need to develop capacity in nursing homes
Norway and give seniors in need of care a statutory right to nursing home when they need it. It must
created nursing home with units that are specially adapted for different user groups, and medical coverage
must be strengthened. We want private operators to be able to offer nursing home on an equal footing with municipalities, and the
who need a place to have the opportunity to choose offered outside their own municipality. When nursing homes
must compete for users, this will raise the quality of the offer.
Elderly in need of care have a right to a meaningful life and must decide for themselves when they stand up, add
themselves, what to eat, and so far it is possible to live life the way they want it. This shall also apply
people who live in nursing homes.
Many older couples want to continue to live and stay together, even if there is a need for welfare services
by one of the parties. We will work to ensure that older couples should have the opportunity to continue to live together, also in
Where there is a need to move to a more accessible dwelling or in an institution.
It is necessary to review the regulation on deductible for stays in institutions, and this needs to be changed
so that patients in nursing homes, staying in a double room against their will only pay 50% of the deductible.
To provide good deals throughout Norway for the help you need, we want to give the elderly
requiring care legal rights to care services. What services the individual will be offered to be assessed
locally, on the basis of clearly defined criteria, based on individual needs.
Shall we achieve quality in elderly care is needed for skilled labor. To ensure
recruitment of expertise must therefore be done professionally attractive to work within
elderly care.
We wish through funding, to facilitate the work to be used
regardless of geographic boundaries whenever possible and desirable. Services must be rendered within specified
on budget reflects the cost where the services are provided, if these are provided outside Norway
limits.
Progress will:
 let the state take over responsibility for financing care for the elderly
 provide private care players the opportunity to compete with the public bid on equal terms
 that the municipalities will be responsible for facilitating and quality in elderly care
 that the elderly in need of care can choose the service they want
 introduce a requirement for proof of good conduct for care workers in elderly care
 ensure increased nursing home offers in Norway so that those who need it, fit
 be positive to the creation of nursing homes abroad
 draw up legal rights for those who need nursing and care

Vaccination
The Progress Party believes that dental services should be strengthened, both in relation to increased education of
dental and through better reimbursement schemes. Dentists must be an integral part of
health sector collaboration. Collaboration is needed both in terms of patient safety,
joint efforts against lifestyle diseases and to ensure patients' economic rights. Teeth is a
part of the body, and oral disease must therefore be viewed as an ordinary diagnosis.
Patients who receive home care or nursing services should be able to continue with his regular dentist,
and costs for this refundable from the public on an equal footing with the public dental clinic would
received for the same type of treatment.
Progress will:
 maintain and further develop its focus on preventive dental health, with a particular focus on youth and
the sick elderly
 facilitate increased education of dental
 encourage interaction between dental health and other health and care services
 better reimbursement schemes for disease-related dental treatment, and eventually reduce costs
deductibles on an equal footing with other health treatment

Welfare Technology
Progress is positive for use of welfare technology. After the party's view it is important for innovation
and development to achieve a good interaction between the public and private sectors in this area. It will be
important in order to develop smart house solutions, adopting different sensor technology and electronic
messaging systems.
Progress Party believes that judicious use of welfare technology to housing solutions could provide more opportunity to stay in their own
housing even further. We will therefore be pushing for the public sector should facilitate and
implementing welfare technology solutions. There are already a number of welfare technology
solutions that far too little is being used.
The Progress Party wants to introduce tax credits for age adaptation of homeownership (ROT).
Progress is proponent of using welfare technology to introduce a more modern
kin policy. The use of new technology can provide people with aid or care needs the opportunity to
experience greater security and independence. Nevertheless, welfare technology never become a substitute for care
and nurturing. Housing subsidy to care homes must ensure funding of basic installation for
welfare technology.
When using welfare technology it is important that there be adequate privacy. Many elderly suffer in
day of acquired mental impairment, and it is important that welfare technology that involves monitoring only offered to
users and patients themselves do not oppose this.
Progress will
 pursue increased use of welfare technology

Institutions
Progress shows that a good primary is important in terms of prevention and treatment
diseases. Health and care services that the public has funding responsibility, should be professionally
safe and of good quality.
Physician services must be organized so that patients themselves will be able to choose which doctor they receive services from.
In such a system the doctor will get paid for the work performed, and not based on how many people doctor

49

has on its list. The system will also address students or others who might need to consult a physician under
temporary stay in places other than where the under the current scheme has her doctor.
It is important to have a good emergency service that can treat acute conditions which are not
legekontor the regular opening hours. There is a need to look at tariff system and what is an obstacle to
doctor goes home to some patients, especially the poor patients must be collected by ambulance and transported to
LEMC.
In order to ensure greater choice for patients requiring physiotherapy services, we will discontinue the current scheme
physiotherapy authorizations. Equality of officially approved physiotherapists will provide greater diversity and breadth
in supply, while helping to reduce waiting times for users.
It is important to establish comprehensive treatment chains. An important prerequisite for the success of this is that
funding comes from the state through the course of treatment regardless of whether the offer is given by the
public or private, and whether it happens in primary care or specialist services.
The municipalities lack a consistent offer in terms of training and rehabilitation. We will strengthen the
interdisciplinary collaboration and cooperation between levels of government, so that the focus is on the patient
a whole person.
There is a need to put in place ICT systems for the exchange of necessary journal data. In cases where
health and care institutions employ various records system, one must benefit of the patients, make sure it
used systems that "talk together".
Progress Party also believes that there is a need for better security against journalsnoking.
Progress will:
 improve the RGP Scheme
 that GPs to be reimbursed by patients treated
 liquidate current legal scheme for physiotherapy / chiropractic, etc.
 have a good school health and a good maternal / child.
 safe systems for the exchange of necessary journal data
 strengthen midwifery

Rehabilitation
Progress will strengthen rehabilitation services and adopting the capacity and competence
available on the field. The financial responsibility for rehabilitation services should lie with the state, while
patient in consultation with her doctor should be able to choose between institutions that can provide the necessary
offer. Government funding should apply regardless of whether the offer is public or private.
To ensure comprehensive services within the health sector, it is important to see rehabilitation in conjunction with
other services within the sector. Prevention and early intervention are important to mitigate the need for
treatment and rehabilitation services. Ensure a sufficient number of nursing home places, so
rehabilitation places in helsehus not being used for long-term underlying nursing home patients.
Progress will
 increase rehabilitation capacity
 equate public and private providers
 focus on prevention and early intervention

50

Mental Health
Progress is concerned that increasing numbers, too many young, struggling with mental health problems and
disease. We therefore give priority to strengthening the promotion in psychiatry. While all parties have a long history
ambitions to develop in this field, falling ever more out of educational and employment as a result of
their ailments. Treatment programs must be tailored to the individual patient.
Many of those who today are struggling with mental illness can and should preferably be treated outside the institution
through close professional supervision. For those patients who need residential care, it must be
sufficient capacity. Progress Party will extend the offer with "warm beds" for long-term severe mental
diseases. A differentiated psychiatric service is essential for reducing the use of coercion and heavy
medication.
Therefore, we believe that a change of the funding for psychiatry is required. Today priority
Early monitoring and treatment over the municipalities since the financial framework is too small. We will
introduce a scheme where money follows the individual patient to the treatment site and thus ensure
patient's basic rights.
It should go without saying that both private and public service providers can be used in the course of treatment,
both to reduce waiting times and to put in place diversity and healthy competition based on
quality in the services patients should receive.
Progress will:
 treat all public and private service providers
 strengthen prevention work also through school health
 have a new escalation plan for psychiatry with earmarked funds
 ensure sufficient capacity in the course of treatment
 strengthen psychologist services in municipalities
 introducing private offer psychiatry ambulances

Substance abuse treatment
The Progress Party believes that preventive work to prevent the development of drug addiction must be prioritized.
It is therefore appropriate to prioritize prevention targeting children and adolescents.
Drug addiction is a disease. Although each individual has a personal responsibility for their own conduct,
they do not go away that it is often the underlying causes of drug abuse. Among these are mental
disorders. We will therefore ensure that the treatment of substance abuse also must allow for adequate treatment of
morbidities.
Progress is concerned that all those who are motivated to get out of drug abuse, should get it
necessary treatment and follow-up to succeed in achieving a drug-free life.
We will adopt all public and private capacity to reduce long waiting lists in Norwegian
substance abuse treatment. It is therefore necessary that the state takes over financial responsibility for drug services so
drug addicts are not throwing balls in the relief. Allocation of treatment contracts should happen
Based on the quality of offerings, performance and that ensuring a width of treatment.
In order to succeed there must be a comprehensive treatment chain with detoxification, treatment and aftercare. We will
also that each drug user should be assigned a coordinator who can provide help and support during
the course of treatment.
For people without residence or independent living skills, it is also necessary to follow this up after the rehabilitation.
We want the establishment of acute alternative housing.

51

Some drug abusers will today offer to help with the reduction of the use of heavy drugs
through medically assisted treatment (MAT). Rehabilitation Part of this has been thoroughly
abandoned, therefore it is time to focus on rehabilitation.
Progress says no to include heroin assisted treatment as part of LAR.
The best solution to get people out of drug abuse is through voluntary detoxification and
rehabilitation. In some cases, however, the use of force necessary to get the drug addicts into
treatment program.
Progress will
 strengthen prevention efforts to prevent substance abuse
 accountability the individual to contribute to solve their own situation
 use availability among public and private for treating substance abuse
 strengthen rehabilitation in LAR
 to introduce the right to aftercare from day one
 move financial responsibility for aftercare to the state
 ensure a comprehensive treatment chain

Hospitals
Progress will change the organization of hospital services by abolishing the regional
health authorities, and distribute the tasks between the Ministry of Health and the individual hospitals.
Ministry of Health should ensure a comprehensive health system in the country based on academic criteria.
The local health authorities must be independent operating units that add up their business in line with
demand and control signals from the Ministry of Health. We believe that hospitals must be paid a state
unit price which provides financial incentives for patient care, so that each patient be put in
center, and the unworthy health queues can be removed.
Effective treatment chains and continuity of patient care requires comprehensive patient funding stream
regardless of who performs the service, and when. It is also necessary to ensure that
emergency services, education for health professionals and research will cover those expenses through
pre-arranged funding and earmarked grants.
Norway's geography and lack of infrastructure implies a decentralized specialist health, and we can not
support a comprehensive dismantling of local hospitals. It is a measure to provide equitable health
regardless of residence whether it is acute or chronic disease.
Development of new rural medical centers-clock emergency care and specialist outpatient clinic at
daytime can provide better treatment to more, but should not prevent patients requiring hospital treatment to
get this within a reasonable traveling distance. In order to give the patient the best possible offer, and to stabilize and start
treatment of serious injuries requiring treatment at major hospitals, local hospitals should have a
minimum of treatment which ensures the-clock emergency response. There is also a need for a
competence reform for doctors in emergency departments at Norwegian hospitals to improve patient safety.
We want the public and private health services shall be treated equally legal and economic order to
compete on equal terms. Patients should be after having been granted a particular health of the public,
even have the right to choose which service they want to avail. Patients should also be able to choose
approved healthcare abroad. Healthcare professionals should as far as possible be used for patient care, and
support functions should as far as possible safeguarded by other disciplines.
We want to invest more in hospital equipment and ensure that we exploit the opportunities that technology offers
us to work more efficiently. For example, telemedicine is used to a greater extent in order to achieve cooperation
between hospitals and in the execution of remote operations.
52

It is a national responsibility to ensure that hospitals have comprehensive and common ICT systems to ensure good,
safe and efficient flow of information across health enterprises. Therefore, it is better to control to ensure a
national ICT system for the entire health care sector.
Norway has a unique opportunity to invest in knowledge and development, and we will therefore strengthen our efforts when it
apply medical research significantly. It is particularly important to prioritize stem cell research.
Physician Specialists in private practice who deal with health represents an important and effective part of
specialist services. We want to expand the scope of contract specialists and the diagnoses that they can
treat.
Progress will:
 treat all public and private hospitals
 strengthen user participation and freedom of choice in the specialist
 raise funds for medical research
 increase performance-based financing (ISF) proportion of minimum 60%
 have an investment boost in medical equipment and buildings
 introduce an "Accident" after the model of transport, in order to go through unwanted
events at Norwegian hospitals
 gearing up and expanding Radiumhospitalet

Drug Policies
Progress is critical to a development where an increasing number of drugs are transferred from the reimbursement scheme
for individual reimbursement. We believe it is necessary to have a review of this scheme.
Norway has through his research and access to capital are well placed to be able to lie in
forefront experimental medicine. Norwegian regulations and guidelines relating to adopt new
therapeutics should be softened and adapted to other Scandinavian countries. The current arrangement
which in practice means that it is politicians and not the communities who approves the new medicine should be used,
must change.
To preserve expertise in pharmacies as well as ensuring that new drugs coming fast in use will we both
undergo pharmacy margin and increase the de minimis limit.
Progress will:
 be positive for experimental medicine
 strengthen medical research and development
 that deductibles should be kept at a moderate level
 that several non-prescription drugs can be sold in the shop

Gene and biotechnology
Many people living today have longer and better lives thanks to advances in gene and
biotechnology. Progress has a positive attitude towards the possibilities offered by R &
the use of gene and biotechnology. We therefore believe that Norway should not have stricter regulation than others
countries it is natural to compare itself with. As long as it is medically and ethically, should Norway be
a pioneer in research and development of gene and biotechnology.
Norway has strict rules with regard to the treatment of infertility. This causes the methods
offered in other countries, and that there are accepted as medically necessary, are not part of the Norwegian
treatment.

53

There must be a legal precondition for assisted fertilization the biological origin can be clearly
defined as one biological mother and one biological father. It will thus be a prerequisite for
eggtransplantasjon and sperm donor is known. Progress Party does not support surrogacy as a method for obtaining
his children.
Progress Party are positive to the opportunities gene and biotechnology, to improve and develop people's lives while
this happens within safe and scientifically approved forms.
It should be possible to use preimplantation diagnosis and prenatal diagnosis, and ultrasound should be able to
is also used before 12 weeks of pregnancy where desired and professionally sound.
Progress will:
 pursue a positive and modern developments in gene and biotechnology
 increasing research efforts in Norway considerably

Organ donation
Progress sees the need to increase focus on organ donation. Future health card will give better
possibilities for registering donors. We should concentrate more on information campaigns about organ donation, and
scheme with donor responsible for "donor hospitals" should be developed and strengthened. Similarly,
transplant department at Rikshospitalet strengthened so as to increase its capacity in line with the increase in
availability of donor organ.
Progress will
 increase capacity at Rikshospitalet
 have regular donor accountable by "donor hospitals"

Xenotransplantation
Progress realize that the need for material for transplants of organs will increase and is therefore
hopeful that the research is to identify, and possibly improve, the possibilities for use of material from animals to
transplants on humans in cases where this is possible. The Progress Party wants research and possibly
testing of such practices takes place, as long as the animal ethical principles also safeguarded. Thorough assessment of a
publicly appointed expert panel must determine whether the new methods and procedures are professionally and ethically justifiable.

WORK AND WELFARE
An organized labor
A strong tripartite cooperation between employers, employee side and the government has proved to
be successful to ensure predictability, necessary moderation and adaptability.
The Progress Party believes that a good and well-functioning tripartite cooperation requires that all parties concerned
are heard and treated as equal participants in the collaboration.
Fremskrittspartiet for full organizational and contractual freedom and relate to agreements in
workplace. If someone wants to stand outside the unions, should be respected, and these
must be allowed to negotiate their own agreements with the employer.

54

However, we will work to adjust the collective bargaining system since it does not safeguard the nuances of
labor, shades one can best see and solve at local negotiations. Nuances in this context,
including geography, loads, competition in the labor market as well as the safeguarding vulnerable industries.
Key negotiation does not always such considerations, and the central pot must be reduced in order to increase
the proportion of local negotiations.
Strikes and lockouts The right course is to be preserved as part of a conflict between workers and
employers. Nonetheless, we want to invite the parties to a discussion to find other mechanisms to
come to an agreement. Strike inflicts largely innocent third large loads.
Temporary employment is a necessity for different reasons. This applies both to ensure a
good working environment, and especially for young people and seniors can easily gain entry into employment. Dog
Should permanent positions form the basis for creating safe workplaces.
Progress Party will liquidate union deduction and replace this with a general tax relief for everyone.
Progress will:
 soften rules for temporary employment
 equate unionized with organized
 have greater local bargaining
 have flexible working arrangements between employee and employer

Working
Norway needs more manpower in the future. Labour is our most important resource, both for the
individual and for society. Our ability to create value and develop the welfare society will be determined by
how the total workforce is composed, how large it is and what quality it has. Nevertheless,
many people standing outside.
Value added in Norway is affected by an increasing number living on welfare. It is therefore crucial that they arbeidsog welfare policy instruments arranged in such a way that work will always pay off, and so the
Some make use of their real capacity for work for the benefit of themselves and for society.
Increased labor supply can be secured through lower absenteeism, more people into work and
full time rather than part-time.
With a working life of change must also Working Environment Act adapted and renewed in line with changes in
society and the workplace. The work performed in society both in the private and public sectors must be increased to
maintain the current level of welfare. Working provision in current labor laws must be adapted
individual and businesses' needs. Changing the work schedule will help to increase full-time employment and provide access
for more manpower.
We will contribute to creating a safe, flexible and family-friendly working space for all, and where fixed
employment to remain the general rule. The social laws and regulations must still reflect that
employers, employees and consumers want greater flexibility in their daily lives. Then we need to have a working life
which is based on transparency and accountability. Work Act must ensure workplace flexible frameworks and provide
room for local adaptation.
It is very positive that it is attempted with so-called alternative shifts or desire shifts, which have given good
Results for both users and employees in several locations in the country. Experiments with alternate shifts have given users
more predictability, while employees receive longer leave periods. Much can also indicate that
such rotation schemes contribute to better resource utilization, lower absenteeism and fewer part-time jobs.
Progress will:
 open that alternate shifts can be decided locally
55



liberalize the Working Environment Act so as to ensure labor market flexibility, but safe framework and allow
for local adaptation

Sick pay scheme
The Progress Party believes that it is important to encourage the lowest sick leave, then the opposite frames
both companies, individuals and society as a whole. A good and productive health care without long
waiting times will be an important factor to reduce sick leave.
Research shows that doctors' sick leave practices vary greatly. Therefore, the introduction of better control
and procedures that ensure a more uniform sick leave practices. Should include sick leave beyond the sixth
month carried out by a specialist or another doctor than the patient's GP. In addition, it will be crucial
that ensures greater expertise so that doctors should be able to make a real employability assessment of the individual.
We will have a graded sickness, but believe that sick leave rate far greater scope should be based on
the individual's employability.
Mental disorders represent a large percentage of all sick leave. Activity and employment is the best way to
meet people with minor mental disorders, so as to prevent social isolation.
We want a good sick pay scheme which, like the current arrangement ensures the individual a safe and
predictable income during illness. In addition, NAV gain the ability to organize work so that more people
vocational measures earlier.
For many patients with serious diagnoses, requiring a prolonged behandlingsløp, the statutory
sickness benefit period be too short.
Therefore today's sick pay scheme is extended to those who have serious illnesses. We will also have investigated
possibility of introducing a time account arrangement where the duration of sickness benefit depends on
sick leave percentage, yet within a maximum period of up to 2 years.
Progress will:
 that a far greater extent based on the individual's employability
 that relatives who are employed get maintained their rights of temporary sick pay when they
tend his nearest who are seriously ill
 open for an extended sick pay scheme for serious illness
 consider a savings schemes can help people with severe diagnosis has improved
opportunities to get back to work

Unemployment Benefits
Progress will maintain a system of unemployment benefits for those who for various reasons,
unemployed for a period. Jobseekers must be geographically mobile and able to accept work in all parts
of the country.
It would be natural with flexible arrangements related to layoff scheme, wage guarantee, and
certain other arrangements related to dagpengeutbetaling, so that arrangements adapted to the situation in
labor.
Today is not the right to lay off statutory. This means that the current law allows workers in
Businesses without a collective agreement and with fewer than 50 employees, little or no right to information and
employee consultation. Therefore, we will legislate rules that govern layoffs freedom in businesses that do not
is bound by the collective agreement.
Progress will:
56




legislate rules that govern layoff entry
adjust layoff schemes in line with the labor market

Labor
Too many of working age are unemployed. Labour market measures are one of the main
instruments that work-oriented welfare apparatus has, and rehabilitation and growth companies are key players
to successfully include several with reduced working labor. The Progress Party believes that it
must work more closely with the individual through career guidance and individual support geared towards
their ability to work, skills and motivation to get out of work, either through
education or internship. The goal must be to get users quickly as possible employed in ordinary jobs.
Cooperation between rehabilitation and growth companies and the mainstream labor market must be strengthened. Furthermore, the Progress Party
facilitate more players may be approved and provide labor. Progress Party will simplify and
de-bureaucratise current measures structure.
Function Assistant scheme helps people with strong disabilities to work and
remain in work. Progress Party will make arrangement with function assistant into a permanent arrangement.
Labour and education travel is a crucial mechanism for many disabled people who need
transport to and from work or education, but who can not benefit from regular shuttle service. With
this offer can they participate in the labor market. Progress Party will make arrangement into a permanent arrangement.
Progress will:
 create multiple placements, through an escalation plan
 contribute to strengthening cooperation between labor corporate education and the
Secondary schools
 strengthen facilitation subsidy on workplaces and open that companies without
IA agreement can benefit from the grant scheme
 introduce a "flexible wage subsidies" to get more people with reduced work capacity into the labor market,
regardless of whether the company has the IA agreement
 making scheme with function assistant into a permanent arrangement
 make arrangement with labor and education site into a permanent arrangement

Temporary appointments
There are currently strict conditions in order to hire someone temporarily. If a company has hired an
workers in temporary employment without requirements for temporary employment are met, the employee in
basically entitled to permanent employment. This allows businesses often fail to employ
workers, although in a limited period may be needed for labor.
There are several groups that are currently struggling to gain a foothold in the labor market; including ethnic minorities,
persons with reduced work, young workers and graduates. Increased access to hire
temporarily will reduce employers' perception of risks by appointment, which can provide more opportunity
to dabble in the workplace.
Temporary employment is a good opportunity to gain work experience. This makes it easier to get work later,
or get an extension to permanent position.
Progress would stress that the main rule in the Norwegian working life should be permanent employment. Therefore,
it is gratifying that research confirms that about 2/3 of those in temporary employment, end up
permanent work in the company, while only a small minority of 4 percent of those who were employed temporarily
which today are out of work.

57

The Progress Party believes that a continued strong employment in Norwegian working life can be combined with greater
flexibility regarding appointments to the benefit of both employers and employees.
Progress will:
 ensuring that more people have the opportunity to enter the work force through the opening for greater use of temporary
appointments

Welfare
The Progress Party believes a basic attitude must be that everyone should contribute according to their ability to ensure good,
and sustainable welfare systems in the future.
Today's welfare system is based, basically, on the principle that anyone who can, should fend for themselves,
live off their own income and take care of themselves and their own families. Those who fail this, inter alia,
health reasons should be helped by the community to live a dignified life. At the same time welfare policy
arranged so that it will always be profitable to work.
The Progress Party wants a future-oriented welfare policy based on this principle. This means a policy that
ensures security of the individual. We want a welfare system that ensures the individual right performance at the right time. The
However, requirements on the payment of public funds, so that attention is directed towards them
who need them most.
EU enlargement in 2004 and that we have free movement of labor within the Community, has led to Norwegian
welfare systems are under pressure. Increased labor from EEA countries and rapid accrual of
welfare benefits has led to increased export of some welfare benefits. Because Norwegian benefits provided for in
compared to Norwegian prices and wages, this gives very good purchasing power in some other countries.
The Norwegian welfare system is vulnerable to high immigration. There is therefore a need to find new solutions
which can ensure continued welfare programs, while minimizing the possibility of exporting
welfare of the country. Progress therefore believes that there is a need to renegotiate the EEA Agreement provisions relating to labor and welfare schemes.
Progress will:
 that we have a welfare system that ensures the individual right performance at the right time
 promote a series of measures to prevent the export of welfare schemes
 study the possibility of turning the benefits of cash benefits to tax credits

National Insurance
National Insurance shall act as an insurance scheme for residents in case of illness, disability and old age.
Workers and -givere shall pay the premium for the national insurance and acquire rights to benefits in
needs. Social security benefits should be a statutory privilege, not a social performance that relies on
political priorities. Progress accept redistribution in social security system.
The premium for the national insurance scheme shall be determined by Parliament in the annual state budgets. It shall be divided into two
parts, one helsedel and pensjonsdel.

NAV
Progress wants a labor and welfare which help to achieve the goal of more in
work - fewer benefits. Progress Party believes it is necessary to make organizational changes in NAV so that one
achieve a coherent and efficient management. The changes must involve making it easier for users and that
organization adapted to users' needs. A well-functioning NAV is the assumption that
Community welfare is managed in a prudent and proper manner.
58

Progress wants to strengthen the user perspective and users' legal rights and will therefore repatriate
expertise to first line / NAV locally, thus ensuring adequate assistance and follow-up by users.
The current organization with a government and a municipal part emerges as a complex and demanding
partnership. We will therefore undertake a review of NAV organization with the aim of collecting the state
and municipal part in a unit. A unified organization must also cause avbyråkratisering and simplification
of current legislation and benefits.
Progress will
 merge the state and municipal part of the NAV to a governmental unit
 repatriate expertise to NAV locally
 give users the right to change supervisors / officers in NAV and NAV offices
 transfer the financial responsibility for social assistance to NAV / State

Social safety net
The Progress Party believes help themselves should be the guiding principle within the social services and will
therefore introduce a legal requirement concerning a duty for the individual social assistance recipient, if
receiver is physically and mentally fit for the activity. No show from such participation must have consequences
to the user. There should be attractive to choose welfare over work, even if you have limited
employability. Progress Party will make social assistance into a state responsibility under NAV, together
with responsibility for employment and social security.
Social aid should be a temporary performance and not something people should live by over time. Persons of
health reasons are unable to work, shall be considered for disability benefits.
It is important to find innovative solutions to the social challenges we face in society. Progress Party
want increased investment and stimulation of social entrepreneurship and job training projects for young people
social assistance, as well as closer cooperation between the public and private in order to solve the social
challenges.
To motivate children of social assistance recipients to apply against workfare rather than benefit the line, we will
changing the current curtailment practices, so as to not make curtailment of parental social assistance when they have children
under 18 living at home and who have their own income under the tax free income limit.
Progress will:
 introduce activity duty of all social assistance recipients
 introducing a ceiling on how much one can get in total social benefits

Public pensions
The Progress Party believes there should be a clear intention behind the introduction of a new pension system that
it was possible for them to receive benefits to familiarize themselves with the background of the performance calculation method
and quantity of the benefit received. There is little doubt that the pension reform has provided a more
complicated and difficult pension system.
It is unfortunate that we have different pension systems in private and public sectors. We believe it is
need to change the public service pensions so that there is consistency between pension system
private and public sectors. Public pensions should be structured so that it can be earned and added
Insurance benefits without coordination. The Progress Party wants to contribute with a policy that can make this possible.
This will ensure flexibility and opportunity for public sector workers to combine pension and work income.
Progress will:
 pursue a scheme where one also in the public sector earn occupational
added to the national insurance without coordination
59



ensure public employees the same opportunity to combine pension and work income, as can be
do in the private sector

Contractual pension (AFP)
When AFP scheme was established would give the toilers an opportunity to go out of working with dignity,
without losing economical. New AFP in the private sector is not longer about "toilers". This is confirmed by the
those who can bear to stay in the position for many years, will be considerably better with the new scheme. While
workers with arduous professions and those who have worked part-time, probably will not afford to think of one
retirement when they are 62 years without combining this with continued work. This is because neither
national insurance or pension account has been large enough.
The Progress Party believes the new negotiated AFP scheme violates the original
intentions and believes it is deeply unfair that those who work in companies without collective agreements shall not
will benefit from the scheme.
We will work for a new and progressive early retirement scheme (AFP) which is more geared towards those
really need it. This means that you can return to your starting point, and that the State's contribution to
scheme must be extended to include those who are not covered by a collective agreement.
Progress Party notes that the scheme now has become an early retirement scheme for all those who have AFP agreement, where
State finances 1/3 of the cost. Therefore perceived the new scheme as unfair and
undemocratic. We will therefore work to ensure that the government contribution shall cover all retirees.
To prevent many public sector workers in the future may come to stand above the choice to continue in
work beyond the age of 67, or losing future pension income, will FRP work to ensure that you get approximately
the same arrangement as in the private sector.

Retirement pension
Pension shall Fremskrittspartiet opinion ensure the possibility to a dignified retirement and
financial security in old age. National Insurance will include retirement benefits for all members of
national insurance upon retirement. A pension shall help to ensure that everyone has an opportunity
to a dignified old age.
Pension rights earned through premium payments to the National Insurance Scheme. The prize will be shared between
worker and - giver. The individual can choose the time of taking out earned pension after age
60. Pension benefits shall be in proportion to premiums paid and accrued rights.
There shall be established a minimum performance that everyone is entitled under the age of 67 - even those who have not been in employment
or / and paid premiums.
The pensioner can choose to take out the part of his accumulated pension wealth, which exceeds
guaranteed pension level, as a lump sum - calculated based on a predetermined
life expectancy for each cohort. Current pensions granted lifetime.
Progress does not accept curtailment of accrued pension of income, marital status, or
housing conditions. Progress will therefore remove the curtailment of 15% of basic pension / pension guarantee
for married and cohabiting pensioners. It is unacceptable that the new social security provide curtailment of pension guarantee
to retirees with low performance, while those with higher performance can not curtailment.
The Progress Party believes pensioners should have the same purchasing power as the economically active and
does not accept the current under control by 0.75 percent of current pensions.

People who want retirement benefits beyond the level National Insurance Scheme entails, must
ensure this through private agreements with such insurance or savings schemes in banking.
Annual deposit until national insurance base (1 G) should be tax free.
Progress does not accept that it be given better benefits to persons without earnings than to residents with
long residence and entitlements under the National Insurance Scheme. Supplementary benefit for those with short residence discontinued.
Pensions will be taxed as income, but with a special allowance for age. Taxation of pension benefits with
redistribution within the group or groups of retirees, will not be accepted.

Surviving spouse's pension
Social development has meant that almost all adults, able-bodied people in Norway are working shorter
or longer periods of life. To serve most up their rights to retirement benefits when retirement age
occurs. In the future will likely need pension benefits to surviving lapse.
Still exist, however families with one parent, where the other family members are dependent
of its income. If the breadwinner falls from it can lead to difficult economic conditions
bereaved family members. Therefore bereaved performance continued until further notice.

Disability
Transferring young people to a permanent, idle existence of passive social security benefits as
livelihoods, is an admission of failure. For all those who have an opportunity to utilize or work up a
employability - large or small - must develop better procedures and processes for monitoring, qualification and
training that can help strengthen their prospects of a more active and rewarding life through
participation in the workplace.
Developments in recent years with an increasing number of people who leave the workforce and going over to permanent
disability benefits, is worrisome. Progress will also emphasize that people who because of
illness, injury or disability are not able to participate fully or partially in the workplace, will be given an income
from society that make it possible to have a dignified existence.
We will remove the curtailment of disability allowance for married and cohabiting. Today's means tested scheme
children addition retained, but we will introduce an upper limit on what one can get in disability benefits, including child supplements.
There must be introduced a far more flexible grading to get into the disability scheme, and the lower limit
set at 20% disability. NAV shall be obliged and responsible to follow up the users and provide the necessary assistance
and guidance so that any residual employability mapped periodically and exploited.
Those who have not had salary income, or who have had low income to earning above the minimum level,
to ensure a minimum benefit in disability benefit that it is possible to live by.
The disability must have the same purchasing power as the working population. We will continue to work to ensure that tax-free amount of new
disability benefits increased.
Progress Party's guiding principle is that no one under 40 years old should have permanent disability benefits, unless it is completely obvious that
they will never be able to participate in working life. The young should instead have continuous support and good effort in a
development cycle.
Young disabled who however obviously can not participate in the labor market, which are born disabled, or have been at least
80% disability before the age of 26 shall be ensured performance young disabled. We will increase the supplementary pension benefits earned for these.
Progress will:
 seek to ensure that tax-free amount of new disability benefits increased

is quite obvious, that they will never be able to participate in working life
ensure young people who are in danger of ending up on disability a separate development program
work to increase the supplementary pension benefits earned for them with the performance young disabled

Nursing benefits
Progress is committed to creating a caring and compassionate welfare society, and with a
such a basis, we can not allow a policy where you allow more children with "serious illnesses"
experience an almost arbitrary processing applications for Attendance Allowance. Progress does not believe there
shall be such that the family must fight for their rights, and live in one long "rollercoaster situation", marked by despair and uncertainty.
Progress will emphasize that the clinical picture of children with "serious disease" often are very
variable, which means that it will also vary if and when the child to participate in the facilitated
training. That parents can risk losing their income in those days the child is healthy enough to participate,
is unreasonable.
For many, it will be able to cultivate their own seriously ill family members be a strong desire and a good
supplement to the public offer. This should be met by having good rights
Attendance Allowance / sickness benefits.
When a physician specialist has concluded that the severely ill child, that it needs follow up all day,
and that it is appropriate to perform care at home, should the right to attendance allowance automatically granted.
Progress will:
 the NAV will not be able to overrule legespesialisters health declarations
 that the term "permanent unstable state" removed. It must be the actual disease state which is
crucial for the nursing allowance will be granted or not
 the right to attendance allowance is retained even if the child in periods may participate in kindergarten, school and SFO

People with disabilities
Progress want people with disabilities to the extent possible should get equal opportunities to
function in society, like any other. It must be taken to ensure that disabled people wherever possible
degree should be able to get an education and to work so that the individual gets realized its capabilities. Society must add
facilitate disabled by public buildings and public space follows the principles of universal
design.
Persons who, because of illness or injury are reduced working, should have quick rehabilitation and
necessary assistance so that they can continue to participate in working life. Training and rehabilitation should be
rights attached.
Progress Party will establishing a National transport means (TT) for persons with disabilities and
special transportation needs, and that the scheme be improved. The objective of the scheme is that people with
disabilities should not be prevented from having an active and independent life.
Progress Party will strengthen relief aid scheme and remove the 26-årsreglen on aids to stimulation, training and
recreational activities.
Progress Party also wants people with disabilities and large aid needs should be able to decide their own
everyday and get better opportunities to be active. We will therefore legislate right to user-controlled personal assistance
(BPA), a scheme that gives the user the freedom to choose how aid can best be used.
62

Mentally disabled shall as far as possible be given equal opportunities to work in society
others. Conditions must therefore be taken to ensure that developmental disabilities can live as normal a life
as possible, both by participating in work, leisure activities and have the same freedom as others to choose living arrangements.
It must be taken to ensure that handicapped guaranteed better opportunities to realize their employability.
We want to do when you initiate an escalation plan for adapted education and employment for persons
with developmental disabilities.
We want a review of the circumstances of life, living conditions and services for the handicapped in Norway,
aim to improve services for users.
Progress will:
 have escalation plan for adapted education and employment for people with developmental disabilities
 undertake a review of the situation, living conditions and services for the handicapped in Norway
 the rehabilitation / habilitation still must be stipulated by law
 establish a federally funded transportation system for the disabled with large transportation needs
 strengthen assistance agent scheme and remove the 26-årsreglen on aids to stimulation, training and
recreational activities
 educate more service dogs

Seniors
The Progress Party believes seniors possess valuable skills and constitutes a valuable asset in
community. Senior population in Norway is increasing. Seniors are not a homogeneous group. The only
which is common to all, is the age. The current pension, which was introduced in 2011, allows earning
pension up to 75 years of age. However, it includes working law allowed for an employer to terminate
Workers at the age of 70 only based on attained age. Progress Party considers this illogical and little modern, we
would therefore remove this right.
Progress Party considers vested pension pensioner's estate. Vested benefits shall not be reduced or
coordinated because of marital status or political priorities with different rules than those applicable to
other groups in society. Certain groups of pensioners can not be imposed financial responsibility for other
groups of senior citizens through taxation.
The fee to the National Insurance Scheme are to be regarded as an insurance that will provide entitlement to benefits and services in
future when it comes to health and pension. We do not accept that seniors, who can no longer earn new
rights to pensions shall be charged premiums for this purpose. National Insurance contributions for retirees should be
only covers the part intended to cover the health aspect of the charge.
Most seniors are healthy and well-functioning people who manage themselves and do not need special
initiatives from society. For those, however, for health reasons are dependent on
welfare society, such as municipal care and / or specialist, it must
ensured freedom of choice and needs adequate measures in due time.
We want to stand for attitude changes that lead to a positive outlook on seniors and a dignified treatment of
those whose need for community assistance in old age.
Health, general condition and suitability must be applied when assessing the ability to lead transportation,
Limitations based only on age removed. These criteria should also be applied when assessing
employability, authorizations of health care and the like.
Progress will:
 seek to ensure that seniors have greater participation in society
63




remove the right to terminate workers at the age of 70 only based on age attained
pursue an age-neutral society

EDUCATION
Introduction
Progress will put knowledge at the heart of the Norwegian education so that each student's abilities
and opportunities safeguarded. We want a flexible primary where each student's level of knowledge shall
emphasized more. The public shall have responsibility for ensuring that we get an education in the world. Everyone should have
equal access to basic education and higher education regardless of their parents' resources.
The public sector should be responsible for its high quality and for the financing of education. Progress Party will open for
greater degree of private actors within the education system. There must be transparency about performance in school, and
it must arrange for schools to compare results and exchange experiences in order to be even
better.
The education system must assume that it is parents who are primarily responsible for ensuring that children receive a
educations. The Progress Party is critical of a trend in which the public - through, kindergarten, SFO and school - taking
over an increasing share of their upbringing.
Knowledge and education must be the objective of our education system. Progress is busy
of that quality in schools needs to be improved, and wishes to prioritize the content of basic education rather than
impose school owners to increase the number of hours.
Progress wants a national competence policy based on lifelong learning, and that
recognizes the workplace as an important arena for training. To achieve this there must be more closely linked
ties between school and work, so that educational institutions take greater regard to employment and
labor market needs.
Progress Party believes that the hijab, niqab and burqa is oppressive to women garments. These should not be used in
primary school.
The Progress Party wants a strong public commitment to higher education. Parents economy should not be
decisive for who gets the opportunity to realize their capabilities through higher education. Nevertheless, it is
important to emphasize that students are responsible for taking an education one can make use later, and
it is important that it be conditional on implementation in determining the financial support.
We believe the government must take greater responsibility for research. Research in areas where Norway has merit
is particularly important to assert ourselves in global competition. It is therefore important that the basic funding to
research institutions increased, and that in addition established good public incentive schemes for
business-oriented research.
Progress Party will lay down Utdanningsdirektoratet and return to an exam secretariat. The tasks
Directorate of Education today, and which are related to research and international studies, can
added to the Ministry of Education.

Basic education
It is the parents who are responsible for raising their children. Schools should do what follows from
curriculum, but beyond this it is the parents who are responsible for children's development.
The Progress Party believes that the starting point must be that every parent wants the best for their children.
64

Progress Party believes it is important to distinguish between school and leisure. Norway is a country with a tradition of a rich offer of
leisure activities outside school, such as sports teams, marching bands, scouts and so on. We believe it is important to
hold fast to this distinction and is a school model in which recreational activities are added to the school day, so
supporters of all-day school wants.
Progress Party will give parents more power by giving them school choice. All children should have the right to go to the nearest
elementary school, but parents should also have the opportunity to apply their children to a different school if they wish
it.
A good school is not created by politicians and bureaucrats, but by those who constitute the school; students, employees,
parents and school administrators. Public authorities should not put obstacles in the way of a good development
school, but creating good and predictable framework for school development.
The school is currently overly detailed guided by central authorities. Constantly new and detailed rules, circulars and
plans creates a lot of frustration and does not promote learning. School owners and employees currently use a lot of time
reporting and documentation, without providing better education. Samples and measurements must increasingly
contribute to better learning. It must be shown greater respect for school administrators and teachers' professional judgment. The school
must increasingly be targeted, and less detail is controlled.

Objectives of primary education
Progress supports the Knowledge, but believes that the current curriculum is everything
extensive. The curricula must be simplified and made clearer, but it should always be local
Customization for the school owners who want it.
We will increasingly emphasize basic subjects that are crucial to the further development, that those in adult
age to function in the Norwegian and international community. Good knowledge of Norwegian, English,
mathematics, science and ICT, as well as understanding of Norwegian society and Norwegian values, will become increasingly
important in an international world. Mathematics should also be aimed at giving young people a better understanding of
managing personal finances. Cultural formation implies that students should have knowledge of Norwegian and
Western culture, language and history. The Christian and humanist inheritance shall be in a unique position.
The Education Act should be softened to provide school authorities greater freedom to choose how their school day shall
organized. Should include the clause in the Education Act that prevents level-based training are removed.
There is a need for a more flexible curriculum and lessons. School owners themselves must find their model
organization of the school day. Central Government should set certain minimum requirements for what students should learn,
but school owner must have greater freedom to decide how it will be resolved.
By grading in order and conduct of the third grade, and in mathematics, English and Norwegian from
fifth grade, the individual student and his or her parents in a simple and easy way to follow the
social and professional development. By having such a feedback will at an early stage could see how
each has its strengths and build up under this, while early could put extra resources
where necessary.
The Progress Party wants no central regulations on homework assistance scheme, but believes that questions about homework and
homework must be up to the individual school.
Progress will:
 introduce flexible school age with school no later than at age seven
 the marks must be based on objective professional achievements, so that all parties in the school can get a
good measurement of learning outcomes
 introducing grades in math, English and Norwegian, and from fifth grades
65

give students the freedom to opt out of 2 foreign languages ​​or linguistic specialization in English or Norwegian in
middle school
ensure a more practical secondary including by providing school owner the freedom to shape the content
in elective subjects
resisting demands for increased hours and extension of the school day, but let school authorities determine this

Selected areas
Science Commitment
Progress sees a particular need to strengthen science and science initiatives in education.
Norway has a great need for manpower with scientific expertise, but unfortunately we have in recent years seen
that expertise in science among students has decreased. This is serious.
To get up competence and interest in science, it is important to better science teachers.
It must therefore be introduced incentive to get people with scientific backgrounds in other parts of the labor market
into the schools.

Counseling
There is a great need to increase the competence of counselors in Norwegian schools. Those who work as counselors
are important for educational choices. Unfortunately, we see today that there is a lack of expertise among our
advisors both business and education.
Progress will therefore consider introducing a form of certification for consultants to secure a
minimum competence. It is also important to have good cooperation with industry and other
educational institutions. One can for example put in place arrangements so that consultants can be seconded by various
professions. It must also be easier for educational groups with experience of other labor to be hired
in school as advisors.

Christianity
Christianity and Christian heritage have lost space in both religious philosophical and ethical discipline (RLE) and
preamble recent years. This has meant that, for instance, have been questioned about
bordbønn and worship in their school years should be allowed. The Progress Party believes that Christianity should have a
special position in RLE subject, and that there should be no doubt that school authorities should be free to draw our
Christian heritage into school life and school worship should be allowed. It will of course also be
possible to apply for exemption from performing activities.

Secondary language teaching
Progress wants to make the written and oral secondary language teaching optional.

School environment
The Progress Party believes it is very important that students have a good physical and psychosocial environment of the school. In
Today we see that many schools are due, and that there are poor physical working conditions for students.

66

The Progress Party believes that we need greater investment in upgrading of school buildings. Investing in
school buildings is an investment for future value creation, and we must prioritize.
Safety in school life is a precondition for prosperity and learning and that students look forward to going on
the school. Systematic work for a good school environment and prevention of abusive behavior is important. It must
turned down hard on offensive behavior and bullying, and it is important that students and parents do not feel
powerless in such situations.

Special needs education
The education system should increasingly take into account that pupils are different and have different abilities and needs. School owners
shall have a duty to ensure students with special needs necessary aids.
Each student shall have the right to adapted education, and control bodies must ensure that this right is safeguarded by
each school. Schools should meet students' rights, but we believe that it is much better
exploitation of resources that schools themselves will insert the measures they deem necessary, without this going
through heavy bureaucratic channels.
It is worrying that more and more resources to basic education is tied up in special education,
something that goes beyond the customized training. Special today is characterized by long
processing, increased bureaucracy and delayed efforts.
The more resources that are bound up in special education, the less is left to the custom
training. This has become a vicious circle, where the concept of normality increasingly becoming smaller and smaller, and there
increasing numbers receive special education rather than education systems in the mainstream classroom.
The Progress Party wants a review of the psychology service and the right to special education, as well as the use of special school.
Progress will:
 that the bully must change schools when skolebytte is the only resort in severe bullying
 increase investment in school buildings
 the secondary language teaching and exams in regional languages ​​should be optional
 have a real commitment to science
 ensure Christianity and the Christian heritage in basic education
 strengthening the expertise of advisors

Coping in school
The Progress Party wants all rivers should be able to feel mastery of the school. Each child is unique, and we recognize that children are
different, but they should get the same opportunity - yet with different approach, based on their own
assumptions.
A strengthening of basic subjects is a prerequisite, but with a different pedagogical approach. Pupils are
different and have different learning abilities. Progress Party will evaluate teachers' pedagogical approach. Progress Party will
changing unit school as it stands today and create a school with more and different educational
learning models. It gives each student starting point for mastering. Coping is important, it provides increased self-esteem and
contributes to also succeed in other areas.
Dropping out of high school is worrying, and this is partly due to lack of basic knowledge of
primary school. Special instruction may stigmatize individual, and an altered educational
approach has shown that even the poorest students mastered - only teachers use a language and approach
that students understand.

67

Financing and equal treatment of public and private
schools
The Progress Party believes the money should follow the learner, regardless of whether the student is in public or private
school. We will therefore have differentiated unit price financing of schools. So there will be more equal treatment
between private and public schools. The municipality will still have overall responsibility for ensuring that all students have a
training.
Progress Party will have a reorganization of the public schools, so that they floated to become independent units with
its executives driftsstyrer, chosen by school owners, but with parental representation.
Private schools are an important part of a diverse and varied schools of Norway. Private schools are also important for the
freedom of choice to be real for parents and students.
Private schools' right and opportunity to develop their individuality, whether it's teaching methods or
beliefs, must be strengthened. It implies freedom to hire, freedom to design curriculum, organization and method.
We want freedom of establishment of private schools, provided that quality standards are met. It is assumed, however,
that such schools are not an obstacle to integration.
Parents who use private schools have already paid the tuition of other taxes. We will have a
financing system that equally treats public and private schools. We believe the cost of capital
(rent / buildings) to private schools must be included in the grant. Schools must get 100% subsidy. Only then will there
possible that all who wish may choose private school, regardless of their parents' finances.
Progress will:
 introducing school choice
 treat all public and private schools with regard to financing
 introduce a funding model where money follows the pupil
 cherish greatly custody
 that the schools' results are publicly available

On teacher education and quality teachers
Progress is concerned that the teaching profession must become more attractive. We do this partly by increasing
opportunities for continuing education. We want to introduce a voluntary expertise semester each
seventh year, which gives employees the opportunity to take continuing education, research in the field of his, in observation in
industry or have other arrangements for skills development. The contents of this expertise semester must
decided by the individual teacher in cooperation with school authorities, based on what kind of skills the school and teacher
need.
To invest in teacher training and continuing education for those who teach in schools there
important thing we can do to improve the education system.
Progress also wants to strengthen the professional profile in education and will require that anyone who
to teach from 5.trinn must have a minimum of 60 credits in Norwegian, mathematics and English to teach
these subjects. The goal should not be a teacher who can bit about everything but skilled teachers with professional expertise
within their fields. With this system we will get an increase in master's degrees in secondary schools and teachers
middle school.
The school does not get better than teachers who teach there. Therefore it is important that schools are fully utilized the
competence of the teaching staff. Planning and implementation of teaching and evaluating
student work must be the teacher's main tasks. The school must therefore have another device to treat
reporting, special monitoring and mercantile tasks.
Progress will:
68







set standards for teacher if a minimum of 60 credits to be able to teach mathematics,
Norwegian and English from 5.trinn
require masters for teaching personnel in the general studies programs
secondary school
that teachers should have the right and duty to continuing education
give all staff in schools entitled to a "capacity building semester" every seven years.
that salaries of teachers should be determined locally

General studies program
It is important with a high professional level of the general studies programs. The Progress Party believes that
those who teach in general studies programs should have a master's degree and lecturer expertise.
The Progress Party believes part of the curriculum is too extensive and diffuse, and that they must be simplified and
clarified. It is a national task to draw up clear evaluation criteria for the subjects.
Progress is critical to increasing the use of assistive devices and the Internet on the exam. Exam will measure
learner's knowledge and professional understanding, not just the ability to find information. We therefore believe that it is
requires a critical review of the exam arrangements.

Secondary education
The Progress Party believes that there can be different requirements to get into a high school,
Depending on the relevance they have different characters for further study. In this way one will get
grab them as best suited for the different education departments.
The studies part of secondary education must have a high level, and one should look at tiered
training to ensure the pupil from the instruction. It is also a critical success factor that
teaching done interesting, and that requirements of individual students so that learning lust becomes high.
For the vocational education is crucial that cooperation between school and business is good, a
cooperation has been strengthened in recent years. Firms should be given the opportunity to come early into school
to contribute to the teaching of the apprentices who later get apprenticeships in companies.
Norwegian workers have been and are still among the best in the world. It is extremely important for both our
industry and for Norway as a society, we have a good vocational training. Much of the criticism of vocational
vocational training is that students come too late in the process to work within the subject they actually
want to educate themselves, and that many of the subjects are of little relevance. The Progress Party believes that we are already in it
first year in vocational education should be given a greater degree of sharpening of education, towards the discipline students
want to educate themselves in. This would increase the motivation of students and make them better able to enter that
apprentices in companies.
Many students drop during his high school education, which leads to unfortunate
consequences for both society and the individual. We will therefore look at possible measures to reduce
dropout rate, such as increased practical teaching and flexible school day. The ability to stretch
education course by combining work and education to a greater extent than today, may also be an option.
Sharpening of VG1, occupation correcting common subjects and the introduction of more and past practice, will make vocational subjects
more relevant for students and business, and lead to less apostasy.
Progress Party believes that one must have achieved grade 2 or better in mathematics, English and Norwegian
main goal in elementary school, before you get start with secondary education. Students with lower grades shall
given the opportunity to improve these through personalized courses in municipal auspices.
Progress will:



basing admission to high school marks in subjects relevant to the learner
education
the costs of tuition, books, supplies and equipment should be covered by unit price financing,
Whatever your choice of education
facilitate better cooperation between schools and business, including by combining a
apprenticeship grants per student, with the removal of payroll tax to cover the costs of the practical and
theoretical part of vocational education
that secondary language training should be optional
further develop and strengthen JA and similar industry relevant student work
reinforce counseling

Industry-driven training
Progress wants a softening of the Private Education Act so that it can be opened up for industry controlled
training. By this we mean that the companies themselves can establish their own training programs. Firms can then
educate workers with the skills they need in their business. The training must of course be
accordance with the national curricula.

Higher education
Progress will develop Norway as a nation of knowledge. To that Norway must have an offer
in higher education that is competitive internationally. Public financing of
private- and public campuses, should increasingly be equated.
The educational institutions must combine teaching with research and have close contact with
international institutions with high level of teaching and research. Students should actively take part in
research at educational institutions.
Higher learning institutions should be able to decide their curriculum and their way of organizing the training
on inside national requirements and limits. Universities and colleges should be able to determine admission to
students.
The financing schemes should increasingly be used to control the HEIs capacity,
to strengthen the programs in which the workplace to the greatest extent requested expertise.
Norway has a great shortage of engineers and skilled labor to work in the oil and gas industry and in
other knowledge-intensive industries. We have a great need for highly qualified and skilled engineers, and
Norway is bound to have a world leader scholarships and incentives for engineers whether we should continue
the great value in the future. Progress Party would therefore like to introduce a pilot project where we will
full funding of students at several of the world's top universities. This will be a useful investment
where we cultivate our talents in sciences.
Progress will:
 finance study for some of the best students.
 have full local freedom for individual schools to organize school life in terms of educational
content and focus areas

Vocational schools
Progress will strengthen vocational colleges by providing more flexible framework, where funding-responsibility
added to the state. To get more technical colleges that provide offers of market-driven quality education, we will
creating better conditions for industry controlled vocational schools. Various forms of cooperation between schools and business,
70

also purely private, industry-run vocational schools, will provide updated knowledge to students who want vocational training.
This also ensures that the program is consistent with the needs of business.

Study financing
Progress is concerned that everyone should get a financial support they can live on, and which simultaneously allows
to complete the program in the prescribed time and with good results. The sum of loans and grants should provide students
sufficient purchasing power so they can study full-time. Progress Party considers it problematic that the sum of loans and
Scholarship does not follow the usual wage and price inflation, therefore, should loans and grants linked to
the basic amount.
The study financing system should be changed by providing higher grant proportion to those students who fail to implement
studies in the prescribed time or shorter. Students with special needs additional time to finalize a
commenced education, must have the opportunity to obtain a supplementary / supplementary grant when this is
evidenced by the educational institution / physician.
Progress Party will supplement State Educational Loan Fund with a government guarantee that the individual student
can avail. How will each student be guaranteed student loans on the same terms as at present, but will be able to
choose the bank you want.
In a globalized world it is important to facilitate that Norwegian students have opportunities to take
education abroad. Therefore we want 70% of school financial support being given as grants both for undergraduate and
Master students.
Norwegian students should have opportunities to study abroad if they wish. This
imply equal financial support to both full- and delgradsstudier and support for the first year of education in the US and
non-Western countries.
Norwegian students at approved private educational institutions in Norway should overturn student loans
applies tuition fees or tuition fees, to grant the same model applicable to Norwegian students
abroad.
Progress will
 introducing 11-month study support
 strengthen basic funding for universities and colleges
 that all who qualify for it should have the opportunity to pursue higher education regardless of their own or
parents' finances
 better conditions for foreign students
 raising the limit for how much you can earn and have the fortune before benefits from the State Educational Loan Fund
truncated
 build 2,000 student housing units a year

Lifelong learning
Labour and business are constantly changing, and lifelong learning is becoming increasingly important. Norway has a large
number høykompetansearbeidsplasser, and many workers will for various reasons need
retraining, while others will need more and more continuing education.
Progress Party will have a good, effective adult education sector, where competence courses that can be utilized in
a value-added employment priority. Nowadays grow interstate fragmented and not very transparent, something
which do not provide optimal use of resources, and that creates problems for users. Progress Party will have in place one
national strategy for lifelong learning in cooperation with social partners, academia and
adult education institutions.

71

Research
Norway, as a knowledge-based society, must take steps to ensure that research is best
possible growth conditions and will benefit society as a whole. At a time when the world is becoming smaller and there
boundaries are blurring, the Norwegian research to a greater extent than previously be internationally oriented.
Maintaining Norway's position as a knowledge-based economy with a competitive, dynamic
and productive sector, requires a boost in research efforts.
Competition promotes quality, therefore it is positive that the competition becomes an integral part of
framework conditions for Norwegian researchers, while researchers also need to be given better and more long-term conditions.
Progress therefore believes that Norwegian research policy should prioritize areas where we have
competitive advantages, industry structural advantages, natural advantages or a combination thereof.
Basic research is a public good of major importance for society and should therefore be ensured adequate
resources and be free and independent. The public funding must be long term and predictable to
create research that have high quality and competitive.
Applied research creates the potential for increased productivity, innovation and creativity in business as well
as in the public sector. There is a correlation between investment in research, development and innovation and growth
in the economy. Closer cooperation between industry and research institutions is therefore very important,
and something we want to encourage.
It is important to strengthen research positive influence for better use of resources in the public sector, and for
innovation and productivity in business. It is particularly important to work to reduce the time
takes from knowledge becomes available to the implemented in commercial and public sectors.
It is positive that individuals and businesses donate money to charitable causes. We therefore wish
tax deduction for such contributions. SkatteFUNN is a good initiative that encourages increased research in
sector by providing tax relief on private capital which is used for research. The scheme should therefore
expands.
One element in such a stimulus would be to remove tax on property and on profits from
research institutions and foundations that do not take dividends from its operations. Such exemptions should also apply
for profit from any spin-offs, while the yield enters as equity or assets in
Foundation.
Progress will:
 increase research expenditure
 introduce tax deductions for donations to universities and research
 that basic research should be funded by the public
 expand SkatteFUNN, User-driven Innovation (BIA) and the Ministry PhD
 simplify the bureaucracy surrounding the application for funding
 that the public must lead an active and effective research policy so that Norway can grow into
future
 that the industrial research is targeted at areas where Norway has special expertise or
strong business clusters
 the allocation of research funding also to be based on performance measurement and project evaluation
 offer competitive conditions for recruitment to research

TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS

Good infrastructure is a cornerstone of a modern society, and the Progress Party will make this a competitive advantage
for the nation. Businesses must get its goods and services quickly and easily forward markets. Most people
wants to move quickly between housing, employment and leisure activities.
Good infrastructure and flexible solutions enable the housing and labor expands and why people use
less of their everyday transport tasks.
Congestion on Norwegian roads and railways is because society over longer have abandoned
infrastructure. Progress Party will implement an ambitious commitment to the development of both road and rail, as well as better
coordination of transport solutions for road, rail, air and sea. The initiative must involve both strengthened
financing options and better organization of the authorities.
The state should be responsible for a proper road and rail development in the country. In planning processes must
realistic traffic forecasts assumed, so that the infrastructure is dimensioned in line with real needs.
Central and local governments must collaborate on the choice of solutions, but local parties shall have
veto possibilities in such cases.
In a competitive future, infrastructure for transport and communication become increasingly important,
especially considering the opportunities that globalization opens for value creation in Norway. There is no reason
to Norway with their natural distances and the disadvantages both in Norway, to Europe and to
other markets, will reinforce these with poor infrastructure.
In a period of substantial revenues from the petroleum sector, Norway has a historic chance to build out one
modern infrastructure. By reallocate a portion of oil revenues from financial investments abroad to
real investment in infrastructure here at home, we will increase the return on our oil wealth. Unlike
consumption, this investment in future growth and value creation for the country.

Renewal
The main modernization and renovation tool is to implement the legislative changes
which is necessary to establish a market-driven transport market. The government's role is limited to purchases
and sale of transport rights where regulation is still needed.
The transport and communication sector must undergo an extensive reorganization of one
Department of Transportation with responsibility for the overall transport sector and one transport supervision responsibility
control of all transport infrastructure (road, rail, air, sea, ICT and energy) to ensure that all rules, and
when in particular safety regulations are followed.
National Rail and NPRA distinguished as separate companies modeled from Statnett and Avinor.
Due to the current very lengthy process takes an average of ca. 9 years of starting to plan
project until you can put the shovel in the ground. Progress wants to cut planning time
3 years or less. Government regulation should be the general rule for the construction of infrastructure projects of
national importance. Predictable financing of the entire project will be available at start of
planning process, and it will be mandatory ferdigstillelsesår. Opposition opportunities being restricted,
State objections must be coordinated and the requirement for external quality assurance of the project will be streamlined.
Road Administration, railway works and coastal works transformed into state-owned companies that can raise loans. This ensures
predictable and clarified funding for a more effective, coherent and comprehensive development of greater
projects. We will abolish the post monopoly, but still ensure public responsibility for the existence of a
national service.
The public should essentially own the infrastructure but buy construction and maintenance services in the market.
Progress will:

high quality on offer
the establishment of a state transport supervision which stands for control of all transport, and ensures

Road network
Norway is an elongated country with low population density. When both population and business is spread over
great distances, it is required that the road network is designed so that people and goods can be transported efficiently,
safe and environmentally friendly.
We will increase the capacity of the current road network to achieve better traction and safety. All roads in
Norway will be developed and operated in accordance with established standards. This should include a
high-speed road network that connects cities and regions together in an efficient, safe and environmentally sound
manner. Such development must include solutions that manage traffic outside the towns, which reduces
the need for strong restrictions on road traffic in urban areas.
Progress wants to classify roads trunk roads, other highways and municipal roads. This
means that administrative reform is reversed so that the roads counties took over from the state in 2010 returned, and that
the remaining county roads divided between the State and municipalities.
Highway network should aim to be transport corridors between cities and regions, and the shortest and
most socially useful choice of routes will mainly be used. These roads are prioritized as they
important in the country, and further development of ports, airports, railway lines and interchanges between
transport modes should be coordinated with these. Design of the national road network to prioritize ferry free
compounds and it must increasingly focus on four-lane highways with physical separation between
driving directions. Physical separation between traffic directions should also be established at other highly trafficked roads.
It is important for the state to a far greater extent have discretionary authority in the selection of future pathways for
European roads and other main thoroughfares of national interest. Each municipality should as far as
possible, be taken on board when it comes to location and be given the opportunity to provide submission.
Upon commencement of construction of new roadsides shall be ensured further expansion opportunities.
Municipal roads will be developed and prioritized both for security reasons and
accessibility considerations. In particular safety along school routes and around other gathering places
sports halls and similar can be very high priority tasks.
Road safety is important. By building new highways increases the capacity of the relevant sections
and traffic safety is increased considerably. Riksveier who have no need for highway capacity should primarily
built with median barriers.
Pedestrian and cycle paths provide good road safety gains and prioritized for development. Development of pedestrian and
bike paths along school routes must be prioritized.

74

It is important, particularly along the national road network, the establishment of a sufficient number of staging and resting places with a
standard customized professional drivers' needs. Professional drivers need in a proper manner comply kjøreog rest regulations.

Construction, operation and financing
Progress will earmark part of the annual return of the oil fund for long-term and predictable
investment in infrastructure such as roads, railways, collective transport and ICT. We will also establish state loans
to companies that implement construction of public infrastructure. To further accelerate necessary
infrastructure, should private companies are invited to participate in the development and operation of projects through public private partnership (PPP) or equivalent. This will provide a huge economic benefit. When it comes to
operation of existing infrastructure, this should be tendered.
The state should be responsible for a proper road construction in the country and the use of tolls, road pricing or
Another direct road-payment is an additional tax on road users. Tolls, road pricing or
other forms of direct user fees can not be levied for the use of public roads.
This applies regardless of whether this built and operated in the public or private sector. Exceptions may be made
limited to the following conditions:
 For ferry relief projects it is assumed in project financing that savings in expenditure
for the State for the operation of ferry credited over a period of 50 years.
 On private roads built and operated by private parties and which are open to the public, it may
required tolls. It is assumed that if there regardless of public roads desired
built a road private, should not in itself be prohibited to finance this by payment
from those who wish to use such a way.
 Local expediting road that is locally rooted through referendum, should
could be advanced when the government approves this. Private should be invited to build and operate new routes
(OPS). This will provide great economic benefit. When projects are repaid, in advance
specified conditions, the state can take over road maintenance and responsibility. As regards the operation of
existing national, - county and municipal roads, these should be tendered.
 Local expediting road is unalterable condition that a majority of citizens in
affected municipalities have agreed in a local referendum, and the existence of relevant and realistic
possible detour without direct user fees. It is assumed that the population locally will
buy new road, they should not be denied this.
Tolls collected on public roads under these exceptions shall be used to fund a
specific road project and removed immediately project is repaid. Road pricing, congestion charges, congestion or
other terms of taxes which intends to increase the cost of transport can not be accepted.
Progress Party will work to remove existing toll road projects. Until this happens, existing
toll road projects get interest-free loans from the state.
Progress will:

create an infrastructure fund for sustained and predictable funding of targeted and rational
development of infrastructure

repay debts of toll companies thus removing current tolls on public
roads

introduce project financing of long corridors for a more effective development

give municipalities access to interest-free government loans that are designated armament, maintenance and
newbuilding

change cash basis within road construction so that one can leverage developments based on life
and social benefit

Having a high-speed road network that connects cities and regions together in an efficient, safe and
environmental way
For greater consistency between speed limits and road conditions, as well as increase the speed limit on modern
highways to 130 km / h

Rail transport
Progress wants rail network open to free competition, so that rail transport can
become more competitive. Increased competition will lead to better and cheaper deals which will provide a
significant environmental benefit. Traffic on the railway network must therefore be deregulated by changes of regulations to
Railways Act, and opened to free competition. Control of the rail sector should be added
Transport Authority who also must have a special responsibility for security.
We believe that there should be better adapted for passenger trains in densely populated areas. This
These include adequate number of stations and commuter parking spaces. This means that development
of intercitytrianglet must be implemented quickly with upgraded standard double tracks. It must also be
up to develop and rearm railroads around the other major urban areas in Norway.
The maintenance of the railway network, which is particularly inadequate and leads to many situations
undermines confidence in the railway, should be strengthened considerably. For rail, the possibilities for good
transshipment points in the terminals a prerequisite for success. The railway is suitable for freight transport over
longer distances.
Progress will:
 sell NSB AS
 repeal togmonopolet on passenger transport so that it is opened for free competition on the railway network
 that it is better adapted for freight transport over long distances, including several long
crossing tracks
 that the railway to a greater extent be adapted hubs for other infrastructure
 that it is better adapted for passenger transport in densely populated areas, with double track, increased
frequency and higher speeds
 upgrade the rail network between major cities and regions to withstand up to 250 km / h
 investigate train at high speed linking Tromso, Bardufoss, Harstad and Narvik together

76

Aviation
Over long stretches are fly all other transport superiorly. There must therefore be a thesis
To ensure the population the best possible offer within the air transport to most reasonable price.
The state should facilitate the freest possible competition for development, operation and maintenance of airports.
The current solution with Avinor AS as a state monopoly institution with indirect taxation
residents, and major challenges related to restructuring and change, is not satisfactory. The state should
facilitate competition for contracts for the operation, maintenance and development of our airports, with
well-defined quality and safety requirements. The state should consider a wide range of models and shapes
liquidation of Avinor as monopoly institution in the area. The best model which involves resolution
current Avinor, and that ensure proper safety and quality should be chosen.
The regional STOL network has played a crucial role for development in Norway and has contributed to the
citizens across the country have received a flight deal. Constant changes and improvements to the other
infrastructure has led to the travel time to / from and between airports has become increasingly shorter. It must therefore
considered whether the offer in parts of the country can be strengthened through airports merged and expanded, and that one
thereby getting increased passenger traffic, more destinations, increased frequencies, lower prices, increased competition and
lower public route purchase.
Progress will introduce a scheme whereby the government its costs to route purchases on the regional network of
50 years may be used to finance other infrastructure, such as roads, where an airport is closed down,
modeled ferry relief scheme.
Progress will:
 open to private airports and promote competition between airports where this is possible
 encourage local participation in the ownership and operation
 that Avinor monopoly liquidated and operations privatized, divided or sold and that the state
facilitate the greatest possible degree of competition in the area
 that the Norwegian government to divest its ownership in SAS

Sea transport
It must be taken to ensure that a greater portion of freight transport over long distances can be transported by sea.
It must focus significantly on new infrastructure when it comes to ports. We believe that public and private
ports will be treated equally and that the ports are given a good framework. Port charges should only be collected
for the full cost principle.
New technology within charts, farledsmerking and navigational aids will increase the precision and
safety in navigating considerably. Progress believes there must be further developed installation
such important aids to increase safety when working at sea.
It goes without saying that in seafaring nation, Norway must have adequate marking of the fairway for optimal
safety at sea. Unfortunately, yet parts of the fairway inadequately marked with light or other means.
Ferries linking public roads together in a natural way. The ferries on the national road network is thus a
public responsibility, while private ferry companies should be responsible for the actual operation. It is therefore natural that the use of
Ferry will be free of charge where the ferry is part of the national road network. In the investment context,
quays for ferry connections increasingly seen in conjunction with road network in general. Operation of
ferry crossings should be put out to tender, so that the costs are lowest possible without compromising
safety. The quality of the equipment shall be part of the basis for comparison. The state should establish
standards for ferry offers to accompany all competition releases.
Rescue Society is an important and necessary part of the rescue service along our coast. The state should contribute to
that the voluntary rescue service can maintain its activity. Several accidents have occurred along the coast,
could have been prevented by earlier notification. The current international system with salvage reward can be a
77

obstacle for early warning of ships in distress. We will therefore consider establishing separate regulations within national
Waters, 12 mils zone, which implies a restriction of salvage reward.
Maritime transport is extremely important for Norwegian industry. Shipping of goods by sea has low cost and can be even more
effective if they both national and local planning an infrastructure that enables efficient utilization
our unique coastal strip. It is important that ports get good conditions and that the tax is only required after
full cost principle. Due to the high cost in Norway must take care of all the possibilities for cheap
and efficient transport of goods.
The potential for transferring goods from land to sea is significant. A national port strategy is needed to
lift maritime transport. Norway lacks a coherent, strategic and systematic approach to the development of
major ports and cargo hub. There is a need for that to define certain ports as national
interchanges, where sea, road and rail transport meet, and that prioritizes the upgrading and development of
these.
Public and private ports must be equated. Competition is essential to ensure accurate pricing
port services. Responsibility for ports should be moved from the Ministry of Fisheries to a transport ministry to
integrating ports in infrastructure planning in a better way than today.
Progress will:
 that the state set standards for ferry deals to be followed in all competition releases
 maintain net wage scheme for seafarers
 that work with electronic charts and marking speed head accelerated
 put the carriage of passengers out to tender with requirements for safety, quality and regularity
 coordinate and enhance coastal preparedness

Public transport and urban traffic
The Progress Party believes that it is absolutely necessary to have a good public transport system, especially in the larger cities, and
that the state is responsible for the purchase of public transit services. Transit is the most central part
the shuttle service within our larger metropolitan areas.
We want an overall planning of public transport that looks beyond the individual county. When
county abolished, it is natural that it is the state that is planning the nucleus
public transport and is responsible for and develop infrastructure in the main cities. We want a
flexible and user-friendly model where both subway, boat, plane, bus, busway and cab used from an overall
transport needs of the population.
Quantitative restrictions and price levels should be determined by the market. The extent of subsidies and
transfers must be reduced, including through the use of competition. Progress Party will work schemes
provide greater use of gas as fuel for public transport, especially in cities.
Transport industry conditions must be liberalized. We believe that quantitative limits are going away
and that price levels will be set by the market. Transfer Arrangements must be reduced and the harmful
cross-subsidization of transport should be dismantled.
Progress will allow the companies within the taxi industry can be organized in the same way as
regular businesses, in that the individual taxi dispatcher / cab company is allowed to procure taxis and even hiring
the drivers they wish, provided sufficient Norwegian language skills, local knowledge and
repute.
Progress will:
 the scope of regulation of public transport be reduced
 that public transport should, as far as possible, be facilitated with universal design

boat and plane

facilitating express buses across county boundaries
contribute to a trend towards a more universally designed transport system

Driving license Training
Due to lack of capacity it has long been long queues at NPRA order to wind
practical driving tests. We want to liquidate monopoly NPRA has on driving tests by giving
traffic schools that are authorized for it, the ability to authenticate each other's students after compulsory
training.
Young drivers are to be given the opportunity to get more practice. We will therefore introduce graduated driver's license for people
under 18 years. This means that people from the age of 17 years take a graduated licensing where one can drive alone
with some restrictions on the use of cars.
Progress will:
 that driver training modernized, including by the use of driving simulators
 that driving schools assume the NPRA tasks by driving tests
 the introduction of better monitoring of both the oldest and youngest drivers, including graded
driving license for young so they can get more practice

Transportation Security
Progress believes the need for enhanced security in the transport sector requires greater and more
systematic effort than today. We will have a sectoral treatment of safety and security within
transport sector's main areas: road, rail, maritime transport and aviation. An independent joint
transport supervision is central.
Progress will:
 the establishment of an independent state transport supervision which stands for control of all transport and ensures
the rules, especially security regulations are followed
 the introduction of a system of periodic approval and classification of road network

CULTURE AND SPORTS
Progress wants a vibrant cultural and sports, with minimal political control, based on
personal involvement and volunteerism. Culture is a broad term that encompasses everything that characterizes the nation
and people. It is the result of the choices and values ​​one has agreed on, both spiritual and material. It is
an important task to protect our heritage.
Much of well-being for most people is linked to experiences in the cultural area. Professional artists,
groups, associations and individuals making an outstanding effort to provide a diverse range of events.
It must be encouraged to continue volunteering, and we will therefore be positive and look at the possibilities
for a closer interaction between culture, the public and private sectors.

79

A vibrant cultural and sports in town and country have great importance in terms of well-being and quality of life.
Cultural activities are developing individual, artistic and social skills. This enriches the community,
gives unity, well-being and belonging.
We believe culture to a greater extent can and should finance itself. Cultural life should increasingly be developed
who own industry, where the public's enthusiasm will largely determine which art forms
survives. There is no political task to decide what is good cultural expressions such as through
public support, but where the government spends money on cultural initiatives, it is important that the money comes people
most benefit. Children and young people should be given priority when public cultural and sports funds should be distributed.
Volunteering within the cultural sector should be given equal access to lottery funds that sport. Volunteering within
This area has been subject to a systematic economic discrimination and discrimination in
relation to sport.

Our common heritage
The Norwegian cultural heritage represent significant value and helps to give the nation and citizens identity
and community feeling. Our common heritage is represented through cultural heritage, land, buildings,
music, art, literature and language. The main part of our common heritage managed by private owners. Your
positive efforts is of utmost importance for future protection. When the state requires investigations to look for
cultural heritage, the state must also bear the cost. In cases where the state Freder private or public
cultural heritage, the State shall also bear the cost of this. The set of separate allocations to
Cultural Heritage budget to ensure the maintenance of cultural heritage.
We also need mechanisms to ensure the financing of the construction and places the public regards as
cultural heritage. An example would be tax incentives to owners of cultural heritage, so that conservation and
protection worthy cultural heritage is ensured a safe level for maintenance. Owners of
preserved houses and facilities have higher insurance costs. This should be compensated by the state, because it is
State that imposes the owners to restore the building in case of fire or injury.
The public must also increasingly secure objects and private collections as part of our important
heritage.
Progress wants to safeguard Norwegian culture and heritage. Integration of expression from other cultures should
place in a natural pace and should not be a public task. Norwegian culture lives in natural interaction
with other cultures and therefore need not politically approved stimuli to absorb new impulses - they are
best received when they are not being forced into.
Progress will:
 that where state Freder private property, should be given compensation
 that heritage matters subject to political consideration
 that it must be made a package of tax cuts to private owners of protected and
preservation regulated properties for hedge maintenance and restoration
 that the financial responsibility for the management of monuments imposed state

Volunteerism
Cultural activities for children and youth are becoming increasingly important. In an age when children in far greater extent than
previously passivated, all our voluntary organizations especially important. Cultural and leisure activities
Children and young people are also important for the well-being and upbringing, as well as for the development of social skills and
affiliation. Children and youth work being done in voluntary organizations is priceless as
preventive work, also when it comes to substance abuse.

80

Most residents are members of one or more voluntary groups or organizations. The sector must be given
opportunity to grow and grow, independent of political control. Volunteering should not be used by the public
as an instrument, but must choose their tasks, organization and working methods themselves.
This voluntary teamwork is the main target backer of this part of our heritage. This is a large and
important work for children and young people to identity to their community and knowledge of Norwegian culture traditions.
Much of well-being for most people is linked to experiences in the cultural area. Clubs, associations and
individuals do an excellent job in providing a diverse range of events.

Korps
Corps helps that many children and young people have access and opportunity to exercise art through playing on a
instrument. For Progress, it is therefore important to ensure that bands get a better life. Current
Corps contributes music education of children and young people and give children who want it, access to instruments.
To improve the daily lives of corps wants Progress Party to introduce full VAT exemption for the purchase of instruments, as well
find incentives to improve access to conductors.

Sports
Athletes should as far as possible be independent of political control. Sport must not be seen as an extended arm
by the public, but must be allowed to grow and heal on their own terms for the benefit of participants and practitioners.
Public money spent on sport, should primarily be used in children and youth sport. A broad commitment
the sport will also be an important element in efforts to achieve a broader integration between the country
different ethnic populations. Top sport should be self-financed, so it does not pull
public funds away from recreational sports.
We have over many years recorded a considerable need for rehabilitation and new construction of sports facilities. It is a
large gap between available resources and the need for venues, which negatively affects the
public health efforts, and that limits recruitment to sports activities. Sport is not an isolated topic,
but have major repercussions in many areas. Public health in general, alcohol and drug work, prevention,
rehabilitation, integration and school work can be mentioned. This means that one must look sectoral and
country as a whole. We must therefore to a greater extent take responsibility for banks to offer throughout the country.
Progress is concerned that sports that are not established must be released, and that all sports should
treated according to the same principles of the public. Financial support and regulatory framework must
on the basis that all sports be given the same basis for growth and development. With increased diversity
will sport an overall stronger position in society and ensure the participation of broader segments of the population. We
wants to repeal the ban on professional boxing in Norway.
We wish that the system of lottery funds Kang is changed so that the wait will be removed, and that
State will advance the residual amount for Norwegian Tipping so clubs and associations that build sports facilities and
cultural, get subsidy when the plant is placed in service.
Golf equipment and other facilities for sports that do not currently have access to public funds must be equated with
other sport, even where it is not being given municipal guarantees. Governments should facilitate and
allocating resources through mutual agreements in which clubs and associations make themselves available when
organization and the public has mutual benefits of this.
Progress will:
 encourage continued volunteering
 prioritize child and youth activity
 eliminate taxation of voluntary work
 introducing VAT exemptions for nonprofit groups and organizations
 increase the tax credit amount for gifts for volunteers
 improve the opportunities for the disabled have the opportunity to participate
81



expand the system of tax deductions for gifts to non-profit purposes, voluntary bodies

Cultural experiences
Cultural experiences, whether it's dance, theater, stand-up, live music or taking other forms,
important. They show the present, and they maintain and brings heritage further.
It is not a public responsibility to produce cultural experiences, but a public responsibility to facilitate
those who provide such experiences. Therefore, it should increasingly be encouraged to volunteer and
user financing than funding over public budgets.
Some national and regional institutions are important to the nation's identity and as such should be maintained,
Regardless of which activities are taking place in the buildings. These institutions should therefore
made more independent of fluctuations in cultural activities.
Progress will:
 that cultural institutions to the extent possible awakens commitment and support greater self-financing
 that public support should get most people to good and give the widest possible audience
 maintain support for maintenance and investments for some national and regional
cultural institutions
 simplify the rules for self-employed artists

Copyright and rights
Creators and performers should be guaranteed the opportunity to subsist through their business by ownership of
own creations and achievements. These groups' incomes will increasingly be based on real value in terms
the actual utilization, rather than government agencies and politicians guesswork.
Anyone who creates intellectual property rights must be safeguarded in an adequate manner. At the same time consumers'
rights to legal use of intellectual property not be unduly restricted. Technological developments both
opportunities and challenges.
The Copyright Act should be liberalized in line with our neighboring countries, so as to draw up a general agreement license.
This will inter alia help ensure that NRK can widen the range of archive programs. The Norwegian media market
will be more able to trust other types of rights through a general overall agreement.
Progress will:
 that the Copyright Act and consumer rights be modernized so that today's digital consumer culture is
a good both for those who create and those who use copyright

Archives, libraries and museums
Archives, libraries and museums are important sources of knowledge. In a knowledge society like ours, access to
information of crucial importance, and public collections has for many years been important
contributors. In today's society where the Internet is becoming the dominant knowledge base, it is
important collections have the ability to adapt.
Progress is concerned that library services should be free. Everyone should have an opportunity to use
library services. The library is an important knowledge arena, therefore believes Progress Party that good
school libraries are an important factor in achieving students' learning.
We believe libraries core business must be strengthened, but that activities with pure entertainment
competing with the private sector, can be advantageously reduced. This includes lending
video games, cd, dvd etc.
82

Museums are important local institutions - involving volunteer enthusiasts, professionals and authorities jointly take
care of cultural heritage. The public sector should facilitate local efforts with funding for operation and
investment in fixed. Museums are currently organized under different ministries. It is important to
coordinate, improve and strengthen the coordination between museums. We will therefore organize all museums
the same ministry. Cultural heritage protection is currently organized under the Environment Ministry.
Cultural heritage protection should be strengthened and organized under the same ministry as museums. The interaction
between culture and industry are important in local and regional development.
Public collections should increase its target audience, so that collections will be increasingly utilized. Increased
use will inspire individuals, strengthen Norwegian culture and give pleasure to many.
We should encourage extensive and open cooperation between our museological institutions and private collectors
terms of trade and the use of volunteers, specialists and collectors. Museums' capacity to purchase and
storage of contemporary objects should be strengthened with a view to a greater future selection of historic objects.
Progress will:
 that collections digitized to ensure content for the future and to increase
audience availability
 that collections should communicate with people and lend content over the Internet and adopt more
distribution ways
 organizing museums and cultural heritage under one ministry

Language and Literature
Language is perhaps the most important part of our common heritage and should be preserved as a living resource.
Language battle is largely history, and today there is a growing consensus that the individuals themselves should
few choose their language form. Central cultural institutions such as the national media and library are for people,
not vice versa, and therefore should select a language that hit most.
The best strategy for a strong and vibrant Norwegian language is the daily, voluntary use of language. Real
Languages ​​joy and acquired on this basis can not be created by affirmative action and public orders.
The public literature political goal of enhancing, varied and quality embossed Norwegian written culture, and
stimulation of children and young people's understanding of language is important. The goals are best reached through a free market for
books as well as more targeted measures for particular disadvantaged groups.

Film, audiovisual sector and other media
Progress sees film as a potential growth industry and wish that this could be one of several examples of
creative industries which may eventually give the country a strengthened culture. As long as there is funding to
production of film, these should aim to reach the widest possible audience and trigger the most private
capital. Norwegian film productions that when the international market will be able to provide a
marketing effect for the country, and also strengthen the Norwegian culture industries.
A free and independent press is a prerequisite for democracy, free speech and rule of law. To ensure
competition and diversity in the media, we will work for the greatest possible degree of freedom of establishment in
media industry. Ordinary competition rules should also apply to media companies.
Progress will remove the license fee, convert NRK corporation and sell state shares.
Financing NRK must occur on the same terms as for other broadcasting companies.
It is important for the authorities to facilitate healthy competition between providers of
broadcasting services to consumers. Public Broadcasters should be held responsible for coverage under
their licenses.

83

Nationwide ether media must be subject to special provisions in order to impart necessary
Information in a crisis situation. This will be done by entering into contracts where the governing authorities granted
possession of the ether medium by an emergency.
TV, radio and new interactive media will increasingly be at the forefront of development and distribution
digital infrastructure. At the same time it is a democratic right to have a reasonably good access
mass media. Therefore, it should be taken to ensure that Norwegian consumers are benefiting from the new opportunities.
A country's press is not independent if it is dependent on support from the state. As the press being
more and more dependent on government subsidies, independent journalism weakened. There is a danger that the press
critical attitude to the state board will be muted because of government subsidies.
Progress will:
 that it should be given incentives so that it pays to invest in or support film
 that public support should stimulate hitting a larger and more diverse audience and why
production is less dependent on public funds
 liquidate unnecessary censorship and to oppose any form of censorship
 remove the license fee
 reduce and change press grant
 equal treatment dailies and magazines with regard to VAT rules
 secure platform neutral editorial responsibility
 secure platform-neutral tax rules

Culture industry
Culture often creates relationships between people and develop strong individuals. Culture can be a factor to
growth. People are becoming more aware of their cultural consumption and turnover in cultural industries is growing more
than other industries. Tourism is one of many industries that are related to culture, and which helps
local development. It is essential to invest so that culture can be a factor for growth. Cultural life should therefore
regarded as an independent industry where one can involve volunteering as well as professional
engagement. It is a prerequisite for growth in the cultural sector that focus on interaction
between the voluntary sector and professional actors. This will eventually provide the most enduring repercussions both for
culture and society. It is also important for cultural industries will have the same conditions and
regulations that small and medium enterprises.
Creative industries are growing. It is important that the public facilitates closer cooperation between
in industry and artists. Creative capital is also important in traditional industries through the recovery and
development of products, by marketing etc.

SAME POLITICAL PROGRAM
The Sami Parliament is a political body that is not in line with the Progress Party's democratic principles. This
is a body where voting rights and eligibility is based solely on ethnicity. We want to impose
Sami Parliament. Saami and other groups handled by the ordinary democratic elected bodies
in the country; local councils, county councils and parliament. Until this goal is achieved, we will through elections to
Sámediggi use our position there to ensure equal treatment of all ethnic groups.
Our same political program is a complement to current of principles and program of action
(parliamentary program) with individual program formulations derived from this, as well as clarifications around
issues in particular insofar as concerns the Sami population.

Progress will:
 impose Sami Parliament and liquidate the electoral register
 oppose that Norway joins the Nordic Saami Convention

ILO Convention
ILO Convention no. 169 empowers the basis for some ethnic groupings should be granted special rights
at the expense of others within a community settlement area. The Convention allows for the Sami Parliament will
sovereignty over 40 percent of Norwegian land area of ​​Røros and north. This is an abuse of
residents in the country at large, and in violation of the Constitution's § 1: that "Norway is a free, independent, indivisible
and inalienable realm ".
The Progress Party believes that this Convention is irrelevant as an instrument for regulating the relationship
between Sami and Norwegian ethnicity in our country. Within both Sami and Norwegian thinking stands
reasonableness and fairness at a premium. None of the groups shall be given special treatment
background of language or ethnicity. The political tradeoffs must follow the same principles as opposite
other comparable industries in Norway. It must be vulnerability considerations in relation to the industry as
decides, not the athletes' ethnicity.
Progress Party will also vote against other proposals to conventions and agreements that help to corroborate or extend
special arrangements for the Sami population, such as the Nordic Sami Convention.
Progress will:
 Norway to withdraw from the ILO Convention no. 169

Sami culture
Progress considers it important and enriching for Norway to maintain the Sami language, culture and
tradition in those areas where the Sami have traditionally resided, and where they had their work. Efforts
to ensure this should be done through ordinary elected bodies, or organs originating
from these, and on a voluntary basis.
The public sector has a responsibility to help keep the Sami language, culture and Sami traditions alive.

The right to land and water
Progress wants equal rights to use of land and water for everyone in Norway. There should be no
discrimination based on ethnicity.
Progress Party will impose Finnmarkseiendommen (FEFO), and the properties are transferred to the respective
municipalities.
Natural resources in Saami areas should be treated on equal terms with how such resources are treated in the country
general. Sami Parliament objection right is an obstacle to growth and development in the northern regions. Progress Party will remove
Sami Parliament the opportunity to raise objections to the Planning and land use matters.
Progress will:
 impose FEFO
 remove the Sami Parliament's opposition right

Language and education
Progress considers Norwegian and Saami as equal languages. Yet it is a prerequisite for a
nation that the people have a common linguistic platform. Norwegian must therefore be the main language in the Norwegian school.
85

Progress Party will discontinue administrative Sami language. Today's model of language management is not working.
The proportion who use Sami is on the decline, and management areas for language are the wrong instrument. The proportion
Sami as their mother tongue, there are currently no listings.
Progress Party does not want Sami languages ​​die out, so the remaining three Sami languages ​​are threatened.
Norwegianization has had its price, but the last three decades of policies that have been marked by bad conscience
rather than a real desire to preserve these languages, constitutes the greatest threat to the Sami languages
Progress Party will have established an e-learning platform for the Sami language, so that people who do not live in bilingual
municipalities can learn Sami, whether as regional languages ​​in schools or private. Progress Party will maintain and develop
the Sami College in Kautokeino as a resource center for Sami language.

Business activities
Sami have, after Fremskrittspartiet assessment, exciting assumptions that minority group when it
regards tourism, with their culture and traditional way of life. It is important that arrangements are made for development
of tourism industries such as snowmobile safaris.
Progress Party has a liberal attitude to all motor traffic on uncultivated land. Roads that are not plowed in winter, and old
thoroughfares should be used as snowmobile trails, as well as that it should also be possible to create second conductor
where execution can take place.
Arctic agriculture has great conditions for niche production as all stakeholders in the industry should be able to
develop.
Progress will:
 strengthen the branding of Norway as a tourist destination both nationally and internationally, including the
Sami culture
 treat tourism industry on an equal footing with other competitive industries
 have a more liberal attitude to all motor traffic in uncultivated

Reindeer
The Progress Party believes that reindeer must be treated as other industries, even when you apply
rules for investment and assets. The industry should be approached as freely as possible, and the public responsibility
should be limited to a reasonable resource management of public pastures.
Loss of reindeer grazing by predators attack has become a major problem for reindeer industry.
Management of the predator population should be ensured on a local basis. It is not granted compensation to herders as driver
illegal or having more than 600 reindeer on the label.
We will liberalize regulations for mobile slaughterhouses in order to ensure sustainable management of reindeer tribe.
Progress Party will not that the Sami Parliament should take over the management of reindeer husbandry agreement.
Progress will:
 reduce bureaucracy facing reindeer husbandry
 treat the reindeer industry as other industries
 pursue a sensible and predictable resource management of public pastures
 gradually reduce subsidies for reindeer

Duodji
Duodji is a collective term for various Sami activities within handicraft, handicrafts, gutted and
imposts and is instrumental in helping to maintain the Sami culture and tradition. Likewise duodji important
for investment in tourism in Saami areas. Progress wants to maintain technical training in
duodji in schools.
