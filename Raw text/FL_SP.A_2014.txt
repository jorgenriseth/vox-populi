Speech Bruno Tobback
Chairman

2

First and foremost, I want everyone here and by extension, our members and militants in Flanders
thank you for what we have done in recent weeks together. Lists of candidates and make a
election preparation is an incredibly interesting part of the democratic process. But
also belong to long debates, tough choices. And disappointments. Decisive action is not
always easy. Not when you have to do it alone. But much less when we
must do together. Usually also agree with many external pressures, to camera crews
at the door of a local congress. Looking for a juicy story.
But when I look at the results of the provincial congresses and the congress today, then
each partner of you and with you many thousands of members of this party with reason proud. Because
Despite all these obstacles, our lists approved in each province by more than 90% of
the members. We are more than ever shoulder to shoulder together to make a difference.
Almost a year ago we made the radical choice to our more than one hundred years
rewrite ancient declaration of principles. To our founding principles of liberty, equality and
commitment to give a contemporary and future-oriented interpretation. That far-reaching
substantive renewal was approved by an overwhelming majority. Even now, at the
formation of our listings, we have made clear choices to make room for a
new generation of people. I asked each province with a lot of pressure to put on those lists
visible and much to offer winnable placed on the new politicians who needs our party
to build that Flanders of Tomorrow. I would like the candidates, Yasmine, Katia, Tine,
Jan, Gino, Joke, Nick, Sam, ... wish incredible success. And calling on each of you to
hard to go for them because they are the sp.a tomorrow.
But I would also point out the responsibility that goes with the confidence that they are of so many
members have received. The responsibility for every Flemish in the coming months
convinced of the usefulness and necessity of a vote for sp.a. The responsibility to
next five years to be the heart and the face of a modern, future-oriented, social-democratic party in Flanders. A party that makes the difference. A party that goes all out for
real prosperity.
Prosperity where everyone participates and where everyone shares in it. Welfare which are not only
on the stock exchange is located, but in jobs for young people who want to build a life. Prosperity
which not only gives bonuses but a fair wage for everyone who is committed and the best of themselves
displays. Prosperity that offers a perspective to everyone, not only to the best and brightest.
Prosperity built on respect for impartial.
Social welfare
It is a responsibility we have also included unhesitatingly in recent years.
When I was good two years ago, chairman I told you that we would not listen to the
prophets of destruction and negativity. That we should not resign ourselves to the idea that the
things could only go back for this generation and the next. We did not meet the
side would stand up and make room for the right project of degradation and inequality, as
it then across Europe and made today by some in Flanders entrance. I have you
promised that we would rowing against the current. Or that stream now Olli Rehn called or Angela
3

Merkel. Because the direction they wanted to take us not only not fair, but just not
good is. Because there is a different path, a different project. A way that allows us to social
build prosperity.
And we have kept our word.
We have incredibly difficult times our country on a steady course to fiscal consolidation
held.
We have done it without affecting the purchasing power of working people and
pensioners. Who works or has worked there can still be sure that his income
cost of living follows.
We have entered into a litany of tax and social security loopholes. Systems that the nail to the
coffin were the many bona fide employees and entrepreneurs in this country.
We have the income from fully devoted to lowering labor costs to real there
jobs create it.
We -finally- put an end to the discrimination between workers and employees.
We have to drastic measures in the Flemish and the federal government's nuclear exit
irreversibly created and revolutionized the energy market. Giving families in this country is fair
price to pay for their energy, instead of their household budget on bonuses to Suez
viands.
We have a reform of the banking sector pushed by enabling your savings no longer
can be deployed on the gambling tables of international business banking.
And we have the cost of health care held in check, without patients to more
pay for the care that they deserve.
I hear now and then that other parties seem a long time to campaign being run. We
have chosen their slogans can not be answered with more slogans. We have
chosen to put down results.
And more importantly than that, we have also been vindicated.
Two years ago, ran our deficit, our growth ducked down and increased the interest rate on our
debt every day. This was - for whom it was supposed to be forgotten - not the result of an out of control
walked leftist politics present a passed deregulation of the financial sector. Today is
which rates lower than ever, reduction in the deficit and our growth prospects in the best of all
Europe. The choice to build back the welfare without pulling it away from under the carpet
feet of each working citizen in this country was the only right choice. The selection of social
prosperity.

4

I've said it before and I will continue to say, if only because so few
however dare affirm obvious proposition: the Di Rupo government has done terrific job!
Thanks to socialist parties which are not, as in the past sometimes been the case, stepped aside
because they shrink from the responsibility in times of crisis too difficult
to take measures.
But the work is not done. We may survive the storm and the levees are repaired,
thus the prospects have not been rosy for everyone. We have, such as the
small village of Asterix and his stubborn of all Gauls, held out against the calls of right
to recover winnings by allowing uncertainty and rise of inequality. But stand is
not enough. That Belgium is one of the few countries where inequality does not increase and
Flanders even a rare region where poverty falls is gorgeous, but it's not enough.
Because while it is in the country of scholarships and bonuses for many already going very well lose in
the real world still everyday people their jobs. Young graduates are difficult to
to get to the container. Too many young people leave school without a diploma them a place on
employment guarantees. Allow people much-needed health care out because it is too expensive. And
Making employees were worried every day about whether and when a pension there before
they will be ready.
Our commitment for the next five years should therefore be very clear: to rebuild prosperity
not only for the happy few but everyone offers positive prospects. A
frankly social-democratic project of social welfare. Sustainable prosperity is indeed
not built to get him off of others. That is the essence of the program
that we go to these elections. A program in which we project our social
wealth translate into concrete policy. At all levels, because governments is that they
can make a difference only by working together.
A program in which we re not choose easiness solutions. Where we do not
give in to the temptation to choose the wrong enemies.
We can translate our fight against social dumping in strong language about the Romanian,
Bulgarian and other southern European workers coming to work in our country prices
manifesto are illegal. As the Portuguese construction workers we here in Brussels not long ago
saw with hourly wages of less than 3 euros per hour. I know only too well how many Flemish
employees and entrepreneurs out there wildly from it.
But it's not that Romanian and Bulgarian workers that we need to be evil. They would
Here, after all, really do not if they could earn a living in another way. What are we angry
should be on European rules that not only make this kind of exploitation possible but
yet stimulating and profitable. They even stop us to act against it, because it
the market would disturb.
Our answer is a Europe which not only makes binding fiscal rules, but also
binding social standards for all. The answer is a European standard for minimum wage
which applies to every country. The answer is a European commissioner, Olli Rehn who do not like us
5

will explain that we should abolish the minimum wage, but a fair everywhere in Europe
remuneration and social protection of workers going to enforce. A Europe that builds social
prosperity instead of breaking down. Because a Europe that builds on progress
everyone is a Europe that has no future.
Progress for all means that we must also be prepared at home to a number of old
forms and thoughts to put on their head. For example by face the fact that our
pension system is functioning well but is too complex, too many exceptions needs
just to stay and therefore generates no confidence. The answer is again not
in slogans about the affordability of aging or 'structural reforms', which
actually refers to the reduction of pensions.
The answer lies in a pension system which departs from what we we need everyone
to ensure a fair pension. And that therefore everyone requires the same effort.
Our answer is that we can assure the retirement of this and future generations, as
Everyone strives for 42 years to contribute, in return for the assurance of a good
pension.
And it is self-evident that it is not enough to ask that effort if we do not also there
sure everyone gets the chance to deliver them. And therein lies one of the biggest challenges
for our society. More and more, the labor market in the developed economies there
one where the gap between, on the one hand, highly skilled workers in booming sectors and
the other hand, less educated people in less profitable industries, unbridgeable
becomes. If we really want to build social welfare and to anyone wanting to offer some perspective,
then the answer can not be that we condemn workers in weaker sectors to mini mini jobs with social protection. Or by all of them move up to the living wage, so there
then help organize an inexpensive way of city cleaning. Employees earning more
respect than that.
So yes, a Socialist Party government will be a government which lowers labor costs, even dramatically.
But where we can make a difference. Building social welfare We do this by
in the areas where we can make a difference, where margins are low and vulnerable jobs, the
labor costs to decrease sensitivity. To keep industrial production in our country and to real jobs too
create. So that both the company and the employee will be pushed forward.
With these measures, both simple and transparent, in place of the things more difficult to
create, as in the past though it was too often the case. The work check for example, which we
at the same time help young people into jobs and small businesses a lot of uncertainty and
take administrative burden off your hands.
Social welfare not only means that we leave no one behind, it means in the first place
that we are also prepared to invest together in the future. In sustainable and environmentally
technology, a mobility policy that goes for real alternatives to the car and that public
transport attractive. (so yes, we will continue to fight if necessary as a last
rate increases and for maintaining free public transport). But in the first place in
people.
6

By the child to treat every child. Because of affordable child care a right
to make each parent. And yes, by education in all disciplines and all students
to deal with the same respect.
The correctness of the education reform that we have put on track last year I've nowhere
so clearly seen as underlined by the visit I spent a week ago to a group
Students car and bodywork in the athenaeum of Leuven. Their school has been putting on the principle
which students are first time to explore their interests and talents and the best
possible means to develop that talent. Then maybe it is not the highest paid or
sexiest or its fastest growing sector, but what I saw in that school and in the company where they
internship walked were committed and motivated people. Which almost certainly be a job to
have the day they graduate. Which, as we have invested in the right way in them,
Now, in turn, have the opportunity to contribute to this prosperity.
That is more than ever the project we are going. A project of prosperity is built on
respect for everyone. A project of cooperation rather than exclude. Investing in
rather than depreciate. And yes, it is not a project to be the leftist opposition, it is a project
which we want to control. Because at this time we are the only ones that can make a difference.
In Europe, where social democracy on the verge of difficult years after the largest party in
to the European Parliament. But also in Flanders and Belgium. Where today already uncountable
many people every day make their contributions to such a society. In education and in the
business, health care and community life, in their family and their work,
themselves and others.
They are entitled to our commitment. That we are there with full enthusiasm and conviction to go against. They
are entitled to a project not to some but to everyone hopeful, just
and sustainable future can give. Right to social welfare.

1 ENSURE YOUR INCOME

1.1 Introduction: a real job pays the bills, and more
Insure your income: not by chance, we start with this promise. A job is just a job,
when they allow you to pay the bills at the end of the month. Mini- or flexi
jobs that do not permit you to meet, therefore, no real jobs, but exploitation. Also your
pension should be high enough to let you enjoy your without financial worries
deserved retirement. You must be able to build up a pension equal to 75
percent of your salary. We make this possible, via the first, second and, where appropriate, via the third
pension pillar. Social benefits finally be above the poverty line
prosperity be fixed. Moreover his fundamental rights and can not in the
time to be limited. A decent income for all, that's our goal.
Labor is the engine of our social welfare state. The more people there are to work and
contributions, the stronger our social model. We therefore conclude a pact for jobs. No German
states, but a pact for quality and working conditions. We create jobs by focusing the
reduce labor costs for low-skilled, young and old, by focusing on innovation,
and by making the labor market accessible to all. We believe people want
work. We, therefore, they must allow to be able to work. We want young people faster
finding a first job at their level, that older people a longer life span in our labor market,
people with a living wage are better supervised and that ethnic minorities equal opportunities
get. We do this in the mainstream labor market or in the social economy.
Obviously, to work more and more produce than non-working. The difference between income from
work and a benefit must therefore be sufficiently large. When calculating your pension,
we consider the number of years worked and assimilated periods. After a career of
42 years, everyone retired.
A good income should translate into a strong purchasing power. This purchasing power we safeguard by
the automatic indexation of wages and benefits. At this indexing is not touched. We
also guarantee your purchasing power to control price increases. Crucial products
For example, live well, such as food, energy, heating and telecommunications may not
are higher than those in neighboring countries. We continue on our momentum and keep strict control on the
energy prices. If the market does not work, we are again in order to control prices
hold. We also remain committed to telecom on the ability to compare and monitor
fair competition so that your bill drops. Finally, we continue the fight against debt
by focusing on prevention, awareness and quality supervision. Loans serve
financing sustainable procurement, not permanent to live on credit.
Insure your income, we do this both in Belgium and in the rest of Europe. Otherwise threatens social
dumping and unfair competition between countries, with a negative wage spiral downward.
Nobody is better. There is no future for the European Union unless it is social. Every
Europeans should be able to count on a guaranteed minimum level of social protection with a
11

universal access to health care, income support and social security. So away
with the growing phenomenon of the working poor and unfair competition between Member States.
Europe must strictly guard member states' efforts to combat poverty, unemployment and
reduce inequality. Just as they now do for the budgets of its member states.
Spearheads a strong, united and social union is a resolute approach
Youth unemployment, binding targets to combat poverty, the introduction of a
European minimum wage, the fight against social dumping, fiscal harmonization and a more social
Budgetary. We want a Europe with first- and second-class citizens, we do not want
Europe, where workers have to compete against each other. We do not want a Europe where freedom of movement
low wages brings inside and put the hard-won social protection under pressure. We want
a Europe that brings together work and prosperity. That means for us that everyone in Flanders
might work, but then our wage employment there.

1.2 Working together to create more and better jobs
sp.a want everyone who is able to operate, also can work. Work plays a crucial role in
build a good life: it provides livelihoods, gives people a sense of
esteem and opportunities to advance in life. You are entitled to progress through
working conditions. Work also brings social welfare. The more people into work
are, the stronger our welfare state. The progress should come from more jobs, which fairer
are distributed across all strata of the population.
Therefore, we make a pact for jobs. A pact in which we ask employers, employees,
officials, professionals and government to work together more jobs. So that everyone
is able to operate, also can find a job. A quality job at a fair wage. No
German states, where people work for a pittance and a growing class of
working poor arises. No minimum or flexi-jobs which are not at the end of the month
ensure that bills can be paid. Who has a job, always decent in there
live. Even when life becomes more expensive. Therefore, we reserve the automatic indexation
wages and benefits.
Our labor market faces major challenges. We need to create more jobs through labor tax
making and by fully pulling the card of innovation more attractive. At the same time
we get more people to work. Sustainable jobs and careers that make it possible to
to combine work and family life better, the labor market should be more accessible. There are extra
efforts are needed to get young people as soon as possible to work, older people work longer
to keep and bring people of foreign origin on board instead of excluding them.
Right to work workable
Work provides the best buffer against job insecurity and work for everyone sure we
together for progress. Employment and economic growth must reinforce each other over
is the case today. Because work is the foundation for growth, creating employment and work. Therefore we address
our wage problems where they occur. Especially jobs for low-skilled, young people and
elderly people threaten to disappear or to be created. Since the economic benefits to
is small relative to the gross cost for the employer. We therefore lower labor costs for
12

employers who create these jobs. To avoid the jobs are cleared away or
moved abroad, or replaced by machines. We do not want labor
where only well-paid jobs for highly educated. Because then threaten lot of people and
attacking talents from the boat. Therefore sp.a opt for a combination of lowering the
wage costs for employers and an increase in net incomes of employees. Thus, there
more jobs, and bring those jobs even more. We do not choose to like in Germany
lower limit of storing the minimum road and ask people to go to work
starvation wages. A low wage should provide a sufficient income to live in dignity
life to lead and must provide a perspective on progress.

1.

The gross wage costs for employers for less productive jobs must
Down by a reduction in employers' contributions to social security
for low wages. This will lead to more jobs. The net income of the
employees in those jobs must increase by a reduction of tax on
low-paid labor. This will lead to better jobs, the transition from non-work
to work is rewarded more so than is currently the case. We lower labor costs
not linear, but rather directed to achieve the maximum effect of employment.
Targeted reductions for young people, low-skilled and older because this
groups have the lowest chance of finding work.

On the index, we do not touch. That is a matter of respect for those at work. In this way
we avoid a loss of purchasing power, which would have a negative effect on the domestic
consumption and consequently on economic growth.

2.

Purchasing power remains protected by two annual negotiations between
social partners within the framework of the Law of July 26, 1996 to promote
employment and the safeguarding of competitiveness.
The law guarantees the automatic wage indexation and scale increases ..
The purchasing power of the lower-earning employees rises by a
cutting taxes for lower labor incomes.

sp.a will continue to focus on an industry that creates jobs in our country. Therefore we not only look
the traditional industrial sectors hit hard today. Industrial jobs can
arise in new, sustainable and labor-intensive sectors, which could eventually provide
additional economic growth.
We need to focus on new sectors to be ready for the changes that globalization
technical progress and global warming entail.
3.

Investments in sustainable industries and services are stimulated
through fiscal and other measures. In addition, job creation is central. Participatieen investment companies are instructed to proactively and effectively
to put on the sustainable industries of the future.

sp.a believes in the importance and value of social dialogue. Working together for social dialogue
makes the difference. In the past we built so our social security system, and recently it took
13

consultation for a support for the unity statute whereby the main differences between
workers and employees finally lapsed.
4.

sp.a focuses on collaboration through consultation with the social partners. We expect
of social dialogue between workers and employers deployed
job creation, education and fighting discrimination.

sp.a will create more opportunities for those who are not yet at work and longer working lives as possible
make. Additional measures for target groups remain necessary as long as the labor market
certain disadvantaged groups is not proportional to their representation in the population. Like
in Belgium we are also in Flanders little use of the skills and talents of older people
and young people, people of foreign descent and less skilled. Low-skilled
young people of foreign origin have to endure the extra hard. A diverse labor market works
however better, is a company with a diverse workforce, both economically and socially
better off.
5.

Everyone who works has the right to a good quality of work, with an
acceptable level of stress, an attractive feature, opportunities to learn and
a good balance between work and private life. Social partners and the government stimulating
this. The efforts in the framework of primary prevention at work are strong
increased.

6.

sp.a recommends that people who are ill or have been able to work flexibly.
If you can not immediately halftime? Then, a kwartjob must also be able, or again completely
stay home. To then try again later whether and how you can work. Not
to force people to go back to work, but to provide the opportunity.
Because work is also therapy for many people: you hear it again.

Youth unemployment in Flanders eminently a growing problem. Especially among young people who
leave the classroom without any real qualifications. Fortunately not turn the crisis at us so hard to
as in Spain or Greece, but the rise in unemployment among young people is extremely worrying.
We can not afford to lose generation. We can no young person to his fate
leave and should help all young people to prefer a basic qualification. The
Education reform will allow at least for a thorough improvement of the starting opportunities
all young people. This requires a continued collaboration between education and labor market (under
other employers and VDAB) is an absolute priority, both at central and local level.
Young people should receive sufficient information and in touch during their training with the
labor market. Better information on the study is taking a starting point. In addition,
young people very quickly, immediately after they leave school and if possible even earlier, guidance
get at the VDAB. Especially when there are indicators that show that the opportunity to unemployed
be big. For sp.a means giving young people the prospect of a qualitative and sustainable
career. That can not when they linger in certain statutes intended solely
to start with the careers. We therefore advocate a limitation of the duration of this
Statutes. Young people should be able to start quickly to a sustainable career. We achieve this by
simplified and targeted labor cost reductions and strengthening the supervision of
youngsters.
14

7.

For low-skilled young people we reduce labor costs so that it is competitive
with neighboring countries. Employers receive a job-check that they
Younger pay no activation premiums and reductions to
ask. The cost of the check corresponds to the net wage costs and ensure
ensure that the government social security of the young worker in order
brings.

8.

It's aim is to help every young person to a basic qualification.
This requires a continued collaboration between education and the labor market
(inter alia Gumtree and employers) are essential. Substantive terms of experience and
know-how, but also in terms of infrastructure. We need to focus on both the
preventive aspect as the remedial component.

9.

After the first cycle of secondary education young people need and their
parents are informed of the subsequent employment opportunities connected
be on the study. Youngsters will have the opportunity to taste jobs
in the sectors where they are interested in. This can also help them with their
study. They are informed in the final year of their social
rights and obligations so that they do not unprepared in the working world and steps
know where to turn if problems arise.

10.

Every young person in part-time education must have the guarantee of a meaningful
completion of his full-time commitment. This is possible by alternating employment
a bridging project, a preparatory pathway or a personal-development. We go
Decent workplace learning.

11.

In the final years of secondary education, especially in upper secondary
technical- and vocational training should be able to taste every pupil
the redress of its study through practical placements
('Workplace learning'). These apprenticeships are part of the curriculum. The
skills and competences acquired by young people in the context of such
Internships are attested. Starting their own firm should
to be addressed in the curriculum. To the alliance between learning and working
succeed, we provide a learning process with certification of acquired
competencies in the activation process.

12.

Each training beyond compulsory education should include a compulsory internship
where the student taste of the professional capabilities of the study. We
provide appropriate compensation for using public transport
in the framework of internships, workplace learning and part-time education.

13.

Tackling youth unemployment should be directed locally. In
Brussels is due to its specific location, needs a youth employment plan based
of a cooperation agreement between the three Regions and the two
Communities.

15

In Flanders, the chances of you find work after age 50, much too low. For 50s, we want a similar system as for young people: a highly simplified and focused
reduction of labor costs that leads to more jobs for 50-plus. Employers need a more
conscious personnel conduct and discrimination based on age is unacceptable.
But employers also may not be hindered by costs related to
career schemes such as unemployment payment. This is more extensively
in chapter 1.6.

14.

sp.a want you as over-50 also has a full place in the labor market.
Your chances to find work after 50 years must be increased substantially. We realize
which further reduce the labor costs for workers aged 50-plus and
continuing to invest in the skills of workers, regardless of their age.
sp.a wants older people a longer life span in our labor market, and thus adapted
work (content and volume) should be able to.

15.

In some sectors are the pay scales according to seniority very diversified. This
makes older workers very expensive so they are the first victims of a
collective redundancies and they find very difficult job back. sp.a wants the social
partners in these sectors revise the wage structure according to seniority so
large differences are reduced to acceptable levels, and this without affecting the
employee on the whole of his career will earn less. Government
This transition should allow, and support. Our proposal on the
allowance for young people is a first step in this direction.

Right to progress
Every day, invest in our future, each at his level, which is the task of both
employee, employer and government. Working together to make progress. The time that
Learn stopped at the moment when we left the classroom, is far behind us. Compare your own
job once again with the same job 10 or 20 years ago: What's the same? Perm
invest in education and training during the career is necessary to participate. No
single diploma is resistant to time. That is a task for government, employers and
employees themselves. Hold employers invest now insufficient in this up to date standards
the competencies of their employees. The participation rate in education and training is very
uneven. Therefore, the employers not only cause damage to you as an employee, but also to
the company: employees which is not invested, stay longer unemployed and need
intensively supervised and trained by VDAB before they find new employment. A lake
Mandatory schemes for negligent employers is necessary.
The 'cost' of education may indeed not deter employers: Employers who invest in
education, training and employability are more productive, more durable and better results. The
benefits far outweigh the costs.
But also part of the employees is not yet sufficiently convinced of the necessity of
lifelong learning. They run the risk of being found after a dismissal difficult new work,
16

because they are very limited use. An education bill - mainly fed by the employer and
the government, plus a small contribution which may vary according to salary level - the need
enable a worker to use during the entire duration of those resources for career
training or reorientation he wants. Courses at the employer in relation to a job
with that employer, of course, be borne by employers, both in cost and time.
We continue to guarantee the right to paid educational leave. Especially for low-skilled workers can be a
mean springboard for a better future.
Even during periods of temporary unemployment, the employer must work on the future of his
employees. Education provides the greatest certainty of a job. Strengthening skills
must be done during a period of work and need a higher gear switch
be a period of (temporary) unemployment.

16.

Often, job seekers are not eligible for a job because experience
a specific task is demanded. The employer must avoid this handicap
by offering training at the start of the appointment. An employer who
insufficient investment in the future of workers, can be financially
responsibilized for the additional costs caused by this to the
unemployment and the coaching costs.

17.

Employees have the right and duty of their talents and skills to
maintain and increase. They can use the services of a
individual training account funded by employers and is
government. Paid educational leave remains a right for each employee.

An entire careers in the same job and the same employer is more the exception than the rule. A
good thing because variation and growth keep us sharp. The employee must thereby be
be helped to make the right choices. Also employed is career guidance,
that they should be able to rely on professionals outside the company, absolutely
necessary. Career at regular intervals should be a right for every
employee. We want to ensuring that career guidance also for low- and medium-skilled
is accessible. Within Every company is under internal personnel attention
For his career, older employee and workability.

18.

Each employee or jobseeker gets right to career guidance, both
inside and outside the company. In addition to career counseling at the initiative of the
-working, there is also career in the context of the internal
personnel of enterprises and organizations. It is important
companies and organizations in the field of career guidance to
stimulation.

sp.a choose a good balance between activation and protection, between account hold
freedom of choice and the reality of the labor market between rights and duties.

17

We resolutely opt for a competency policy. A uniform and general system of attestation
prior learning must allow the matching by Gumtree is based on
competencies, rather than on the basis of qualifications. This requires a change in the thinking of many
employers, the government itself in the lead. Disadvantaged groups in the labor market make them here
advantage, since they can often more than is apparent from their degree. A competency policy is good
for your career: who is working on his skills will grow faster for a better job and
quickly find a new job after discharge. Employers will be enhanced in order to properly
Assessing what talents have employees.
Identifying and recognizing competencies is a first major step for many people. The
additional training and learning new skills remains a priority and the greatest
guarantee of success.

19.

A statutory system of certification of skills should allow
employees to lead more quickly to suitable jobs. The government takes herein
the lead by keeping track of recruitment into account both competence as
with diplomas.

20.

Employers must at fixed times the competencies of employees
screening, so they can work on time to training. At the same time they serve
work towards the recognition and the recognition of existing
competences. An external body may be entrusted with the task of the
to screen skills if the employer is not able to do so. Gumtree
takes on this task for people who are not (yet) been at work. Previously
VDAB must have sufficient resources.

Gumtree must activate by investing in job seekers and all the possibilities to provide fast
to find a suitable job. Everyone's benefit to regularly assess whether he
his task - working or looking for work - performing well. Now this is happening already, but strengthened
to be brought forward by the initial evaluation and shorten the periods between reviews.
VDAB will have to play a more active role in mediating between employer and
job seeker, so that the mediation action itself both feedback from jobseekers, as the
employer is removed. Thus, the focus of actions CareerBuilder can shift from formalist
control, for continuous monitoring during mediate between employers and job seekers.
When jobseekers after several consecutive positive evaluations still no job
have, must follow a concrete offer. Who is not looking actively for work or who
repeatedly refuses to go to a suitable range of training or employment, lose his or her
entitled to unemployment benefits.
Gumtree today spends much of her tasks of counseling and mediation to organizations
which yield little result in terms of youth employment. Gumtree must ensure
an efficient service of counseling and mediation results in a concrete
supply of work, training or work experience.

18

21.

Job seekers will be more customized and according to their abilities and needs
monitored and supervised to optimize their efforts. A number of
consecutive evaluations should lead to a concrete offer or a job,
either training or an internship. It is also important in this context that the
demands we make as a society to be realistic and remain unemployed.
The efforts that job seekers perform must be respected.
Only through people support through a tailor-made support and retrain
they will find a job that suits them and offered them as a human accomplishment. This
is a process that requires time and this is something we need to give courage. Who
his or her chances are not grabbing, has no place in the unemployment insurance.
Gumtree must therefore organize itself or counseling and mediation.

22.

sp.a do not want unemployment that is limited in time. Jobseekers
punishment because there are no suitable jobs or because it takes longer for a
suitable offer can be done is pointless and counterproductive. If you
paid contributions and actively seeks out new work, you are entitled to
benefits. Who is not looking actively for work, however, has no place in
the unemployment. Everyone is at risk to fall on a day without work.
To ensure that risk, you pay contributions. We also give through a
power-distribution to young school leavers the chance of finding a
suitable job and building an independent life. During the
arming period, we will actively support the young people into work, training or
education.

Not just a job, but also a good job
If we want to attract more people into the labor market the available jobs should also
good quality and meet your expectations. Working time, work schedules and
ability to reconcile it with your private life are extremely important. Make it possible to
temporarily to work less, or not work at all even for a while, can prevent you
earlier labor market exit. But working full time should remain possible by providing
a system wherein a part of the domestic work at a reasonable price can be
outsourced.
Part-time work is not a problem, but part-time work should not be trap which prevents you from going full-time
work. Many workers, however, often have to settle for a part-time job because they
not find child care or because they have to care for their parents in need of care. Therefore
it is necessary for sufficient and affordable childcare and care for dependent elderly too
provided.
A career bill every worker should offer the opportunity for a certain
time to roll back the paid activities without the band with the labor market
losses. Each employee will start with an initial grant of career. As the
increases number of years worked, the employee will receive extra time on his or her career bill.
For specific situations - a birth, palliative care to a family member caring for a sick
or disabled child - is there extra credit.
19

The benefit paid at times when the work is interrupted, should be sufficient
high so that a single person (with or without children) and people with low wages financially
can keep their heads above water during those periods. Therefore, the current needs
interruption allowance increased considerably, but are taxed as wages.

23.

We form the system for time credit for a career account for each
employee. An initial grant is awarded which is completed when
occur specific situations (birth, care for sick parents or children).
To enable longer working, the credit is expanded in
function of the length of career and age. The allowance is increased and taxed as
a wage, so that it effectively also record the accumulated time
low earners, single parent families and people living alone is a real right.

24.

Part-time work can be a choice, but the consequences should from the outset
to be clear. Employees should be well informed about the
consequences of their choices for including their pension rights.

Instead of having to work less, families spend household tasks. Moreover
the service voucher system employs a group of people who did not before - or only in
the black economy - was at work. Undeclared provides no protection and does not build
rights to social security. That is why we advocate for the preservation of the system of
service vouchers, where the cost is not more expensive than the price 'in the black'. Also in the
employment with service should be sufficient attention to quality, with guarantees
in terms of guidance, education and training for workers. To encourage employers
to keep workers longer in employment, advocates sp.a for a higher resale value (intervention
from the government to the employer) for service when the employee has more seniority
has built.
We want the price you pay for a service check is transparent: no tax credit
more per use service checks you only two years after payment of the service voucher
get reimbursed through your taxes. The price of the service voucher can put today
be at 6.3 euros (today: tax from 30 percent to 9 euros).

25.

The continuity of the scheme of service is the first priority. The
quality of employment must be ensured with guarantees in terms
counseling, education and training. The pay and working conditions in the

Every job must be a quality job, which gives you perspective on progress. A job with at
least a minimum income sufficient to make ends meet, and it yields more than a

benefit. The index ensures that work does not lead to impoverishment and that the purchasing power forever
is preserved.
26.

sp.a fits for mini- or flexi-jobs. The use of temporary contracts by people
keep on daily contracts on the line should be prohibited. Work must
be high and this means that contributions to social security,
provide good protection against unemployment, sickness, disability and
when one retires.

The fight against discrimination
Older workers, women, the disabled and ethnic minorities have the
Today difficult on the labor market to find a job or in a company by
grow. These socio-economic deprivation is unacceptable. These are people who want
work, but can not because of their age, disability, gender, national origin or religious
conviction. It eats away at a person. One feels unappreciated and by society
put garbage on the roadside. That undermines the support for solidarity between peoples.
Apart from the many human suffering, as well as a society we will be wasting an incredible amount of talent
it desperately needs to build on the welfare of tomorrow. Only together we can
make a difference. Discrimination and racism are therefore a concern of the whole society. In
to relativize and minimize rather than discrimination, going sp.a for an anti-discrimination
policy with teeth. Everyone has the fundamental right to equal opportunities in the
labor market.

27.

The government must actively detect discrimination in employment and tackling.
sp.a wants the employment of ethnic minorities, people with
disabilities, the elderly, and men / women are mapped by industry
(via the social balance sheet of firms and / or by figures from the
government). In sectors with a statistical underrepresentation be
Aggregated practice tests performed. This practice test can be performed
by the government or by the Centre for Equal Interfederal
Opportunities and the Fight against Discrimination and Racism.

28.

When these field tests in conjunction with the figures indicate a
presumption of discrimination in a particular sector, the competent
Joint (sub) committees in their collective agreements or covenants
take measures and commitments to combat discrimination in the
sector. For example, these measures include of a compulsory
diversity plan, the anonymous job applications, codes of conduct and
binding targets, making agreements on reporting and
grievance procedures ... The reasoning is that customization is needed by sector and
social partners themselves can best evaluate what measures in their sector
may or may not work. Companies receive active support in the form of
training and advice to conduct a gender and diversity policies. Sectors
consistent failure to pursue an anti-discrimination policy, we sanction
financial and / or we impose coercive measures.
21

Old, but not out of the labor market
An organization work more efficiently if they have a workforce in which all ages
are represented. Skills, knowledge and competencies evolve with time, and an ideal
mix of ages in a company also provides an ideal mix of skills. We
throw your greater experience, increased problem solving skills, and lessons
team skills are not gone, but we're right even more useful. We count talents
on one another.
We therefore transform the negative image that allows you to make as an employee receives as
you get older. This means that employers must pay more attention to the
working conditions of, in particular, their older workers. Heavy, unilaterally,
unhealthy or monotonous work has a much greater impact on each employee than his age.
We take all obstacles away for increased participation of older workers. Wages must
less based on seniority, because that makes all older workers more expensive, without
there is a necessary connection with their personal abilities and productivity. Recruiting
older job seekers, we encourage because the employer does not complete the following few years
cost to bear the payment of unemployment (formerly early retirement).

29.

Any form of age discrimination must be proactive investigations, prosecute and
be sanctioned. Recruitment policy, the career and the
retention policy of each company should be such that they each
exclude discrimination based on age, with special attention to
multiple discriminations (such as older women or older workers
foreign origin).

30.

An age-conscious personnel is the norm. For these employers
to raise awareness, we are focusing on prevention and the sharing of good practices.
But also more coercive measures, such as respect for
age pyramid on collective redundancies and the drafting of a business plan
with a focus on older workers must be respected.

31.

Employers need to worry about the whole career for a healthy and safe
work environment, with an adaptation of jobs and working conditions
older workers. Employers who do not, and their older squeezed
dismiss employees systematically, should financially responsibilized
be.

32.

We reform the pay scales so that wage growth happens in function of
competences and no longer principally a function of seniority. This
reform must be implemented in phases. One must consider the
expertise of the older employee (s) according to the job description
to which they can be deployed, taking into account the physical and
psychic ability of the person concerned. In the long term we advocate
a smaller rise in wages by age: young people should
22

more can earn and wages may mean a stumbling block for work
on later age. They are the social partners in the joint committees and
companies best placed to determine what weight to the
Factor experience, among other factors, to be granted on wages. Government
must make such an exercise is possible and support. Because it can
certainly not the intention that an employee would in his entire career
deteriorate.
33.

The expense to carry an individual employer as an employee who he
later age has recruited shortly afterwards on unemployment with company
goes, should no longer be a restriction to the recruitment of older job seekers.
Therefore the costs associated with the recruitment of older job seekers,
sympathized be employers.

1.3 A strong social protection
The social welfare system is built on two pillars. Workers carry through their contributions to
good social protection and who can not work have the right to a decent
replacement income. To have to live at least above the these benefits dignified
lie poverty line. But it is only fair that the amount of your benefit
related to your previous contributions. Who has contributed more, is entitled to a higher
retirement, higher unemployment or higher morbidity and disability. Who
by adversity inadequately or not may have contributed, of course, let's not abandon.
They have the right to a living wage, a guaranteed income for the elderly (IGO) or a
income replacement for people with disabilities (IVT) that protects against poverty, as
not enough to get out of poverty own resources. The benefits from the social security
(pensions, unemployment and disability benefits) must be higher than the
assistance benefits (income support, IGO and IVT). That is the model of social protection where sp.a for
state.
Social security and social assistance are fundamental rights. These benefits may
therefore never be limited in time. That would be anti-social. You do not have to your property
sell your savings not to eat or not to prove that you are poor, before you are entitled to
benefits.
The more people there are who are working, the stronger our welfare state. Earned income must

work must also be actively seeking work. The government should actively this search

spa

Unemployment benefits above the poverty line. Further, we resist
strongly against the reduction of unemployment benefits over time. A real

social policy limits the period of unemployment, not the period of the

The income for the elderly (GRAPA) you should protect against poverty and

Who really needs a dam against poverty.

36.

Each person with a disability should be able to at least have an income
possess above the poverty line. The amount of the income replacement
compensation (IVT) must be at least above the poverty line. A
Disability should not be the same as living in poverty.

37.

Everyone should live a life that meets human
dignity. The (equivalent) income support is today below the poverty threshold.
sp.a lifts all living wage amounts above the poverty line. This increase will
accompanied by an increase of the federal intervention in the cost of the
living wage for the CPAS.

38.

The living wage should take into account the growing complexity of households.
The living wage category of persons with dependents' is therefore split between
'singles with dependents' and' living together with a family. " beside
A scheme is also developed for joint custody, with the
living wage amount meets real household burden of both parents.

39.

We keep all social benefits consistent with prosperity to the insidious
hollowing out counter.

40.

sp.a anchors the poverty test on every policy at every level of government, in
partnership with people with experience in poverty and exclusion. We
ensure that equal access to public services for people in
poverty.

41.

Dialogue and participation in the policies of people living in poverty are essential
to proceed with business knowledge in the fight against poverty. Around the
lowering barriers to access to the government for people in poverty,
is the involvement of people experiencing poverty and social exclusion
dramatically expanded. Because we are the problem of poverty as early as possible
want to address the areas of childcare and education are
priority. For associations where the poor speak we build
support further.

42.

Due to the state reform come many new powers to
Flanders in the field of family, labor and care. Where social
partners today are part of the management of these powers should
they can do this for the future Flemish social protection.

24

1.4 of the future The CPAS
We leave no one behind. Everyone deserves a second chance in life, regardless of setbacks
or wrong decisions in the past. Everyone deserves an equal place in our society.
The right to a decent income above the poverty line is therefore linked to the
right to social integration. The CPAS of the future, let people up to the
participate in society, even if this is difficult.
Social integration
sp.a wants people with a living wage intensive and tailored guidance to decent work, a
training, care work or volunteering. We wish to distance ourselves against mandatory
"community service" in which people with a living wage in consideration all kinds of odd jobs
need refurbishing. Instead, we help people to address their problems and
to enhance skills so that they can be independent in life. That takes more effort,
but this human approach yields more time for both the individual concerned and the
society. Social activation is a mutual commitment. The company supports
who needs, guidance and cents. And who gets help, gets fully committed in the
counseling project.

43.

All people get a living wage required an activation plan (the
called GPMI) which examined together how problems addressed
be and how skills are enhanced. Depending on the capabilities of
the person, the social activation occurs on the regular labor market,
in the social economy, in the labor care, through training and / or in the
voluntary work.

44.

People without valid residence permits can only rely on
emergency medical assistance via the CPAS of the municipality where they reside.
Big cities have the largest inflow of undocumented migrants. sp.a wants
that CPAS is not only to recover the aid provided, but also a
intervention given to administrative assistance and social research.

45.

Although work no conclusive guarantee against poverty, sustainable jobs is
an effective remedy to get out of poverty. sp.a want as much as possible
people with a living wage help to a permanent job in the social economy or
on the regular labor market. CPAS currently have a number
instruments to a people with a living wage and relevant paid
for them to gain work experience (including the so-called art. 60§7 and Art. 61).
Given their years of expertise, will sp.a that the use of these instruments
after the sixth state reform remains the responsibility of municipalities. By
their local embeddedness they can deliver tailor-made according to the possibilities

and challenges of the community. By binding targets by CPAs
We encourage municipalities to offer professional activation programs. The
targets should place emphasis on the sustainability of the job. The

25

quality of the offered course must take precedence over quantity of the
number of persons who are no longer a client after activation of the CPAS.
46.

To encourage people with a minimum income (part-time) work, there is now
the exemption for socio-professional integration. This exemption can they
a portion of their living wage retained in conjunction with their income from work
(of course, limited to a certain income). So we avoid the
so-called "leefloonval '. sp.a makes this exemption easier and progressive:
who works more, earns more.

47.

The exemption for socio-professional integration is detrimental for couples
receive a living wage, because they have to share the exemption amount. This
disadvantaging we put right by the exemption for socio-professional integration
to individualize for couples.

48.

sp.a wants everyone to be helped across borders settings. The
consultants of the VDAB, the CPAS and / or other welfare services should
work together as one team to guide people from both welfare and
labor point of view. There is a more structured dialogue needed for the 'warm' transfer
files (eg. people with a living wage by following their professional career
VDAB be helped or jobseeker suspended by the RVA
and should be knocking on the CPAS).

49.

We also note that a significant proportion of job seekers far from
employment status and benefits with additional support from the
CPAs from both work and welfare point of view. Therefore, the VDAB needs to
together local municipalities. The Flemish government and the CPAS have a
close administrative agreement setting out arrangements for cooperation,
referral criteria and funding.

50.

We advocate that welfare offices of the CPAS and work shops also
physically located in the same place: in this way, people have one
contact address for assistance regardless of their status. That makes it complex web
public services easier. From reinforce this dynamic interpretation
we work these points so that all future services related to
employment in a community at one point meet.

51.

People and families with small incomes often live literally in a smaller
world. They have a greater chance of loneliness and social isolation. This
'hidden poverty' we tackle by poor through sports and cultural activities,
workshops involving group trips and volunteering more in the
society. Social workers provide a proactive social
activation process tailored to the question. CPAS via targets,
exchange of experience and additional staff resources stimulated. Extra attention
These are for the elderly, single parents and children who grow up in
poverty. A structural reinforcement of the Fund Participation and Social
Activation is therefore appropriate. But also cooperation between CPAS and
other actors such as voluntary associations, cultural centers and sports clubs must
26

encourage the government. Finally, we support more development
of neighborhood networks. Intense supervision over all departments and disciplines around
required. People in poverty should have one contact for all forms
services, so they do not have to find their way into the administration,
let alone the legislation.
52.

Living in poverty often manifests itself in shame, insecurity and guilt.
In all activation pathways is a focus on the psychosocial dimensions
poverty. Intense supervision over all departments and disciplines is needed.
People in poverty should have one contact for all forms of
services, so they do not have to find their way into the administration, let
are the legislation.

53.

Currently, the service varies widely between municipalities. Certainly small
CPAS do not have sufficient resources to provide adequate
to offer services. Cooperation between CPAS is therefore crucial.
Often they can only work together for guidance on
professional and social activation and an offer for debt. spa
encourages even more than now CPAS to join forces.

54.

People with a living wage that consistently break their commitments and promises,
can be sanctioned. We are striving for a humane and effective
sanctions policy. By sanctioning customization is required in order for the process
of the person (eg. partial or temporary withdrawal of the living wage in
Instead of immediately suspend totally).

55.

More and more young people without qualifications knocking at the CPAS for help.
Socialist Party is in favor of the current system whereby the CPAS to help young people
to graduate. So we offer them more opportunities in the job market.
Living wage Students who pass their exams in the first seat should - as
other students - a paid summer job can do without complete loss
their living wage. A summer job provides work experience and gives young people
an extra penny to rotate fully as young people in society.

56.

Many people lose some of their income and social protection as
they lose their social rights - primarily those who need them most
have. We maximize the impact of our social policies are in the

Debt counseling

27

Debt problems cause much misery, they close out the dependency, and in many cases poor.
We see that more and more people struggling with excessive debt. If we therefore sp.a
the gauntlet. sp.a want a client-focused and integrated debt sufficiently
accessible and affordable for everyone. CPAS here form the hub of.

plans for discharging. We also do not lose the interests of the creditor

To ensure we write into law the right to a counselor and

59.

We provide additional resources for the CPAS to lawyers and clients in a
support file of collective debt settlement.

60.

The law on collective debt settlement submit additional
sanctions, to be pronounced by the court to be included, as
alternative to withdrawal.

61.

We also encourage the CPAS to organize group sessions 'budget'
for their customers. These have an important preventive value and work
while reinforcing processes of debt relief or aftercare following completion of
a debt relief program.

1.5 Social economy: custom engineering
Due to physical, sensory, mental, psychological or psychosocial problems can not be anyone
compete at the labor market. For them there happy place in the social economy:
social and sheltered workshops, insertion, activity cooperatives or custom departments
in mainstream companies. Within the social economy is to work with people
disadvantaged central. This employment may be an interim solution to skills
strengthen and thus to move on to regular employment. For others it is not again
temporary solution, but the guarantee of a permanent job. sp.a strongly believes in the added value of
both forms.
The social economy is obviously much broader than just employing people
disadvantaged groups. The economic activities that also broader societal goals
pursue, such as social services (eg. social restaurants, bike repair services or cleaning and
restoration work) or durable goods manufacturing (eg. the thrift shops, or energiesnoeiers
28

organic horticulture). These activities provide employment through social responses to new
social
developments
(eg.
energy efficient
neighborhoods,
new
Models
from
community facilities, etc.). These are goals we naturally endorse wholeheartedly
and want to support further.
62.

We support the social economy in all its manifestations. The
resources are available for employment at the federal level in the today
social economy must remain available after the state reform for the
social economy.

63.

Recently gave sp.a for a new legal framework that regulates employment
in social and sheltered workshops and integration enterprises (the so-called
'Custom decree). Centered sustainable support
maatwerkbedrijven- and departments and a quality support to the
workplace tailored to the workers concerned. In the future we need this
customized decree succeed, let observe and invest in the further roll-out and
anchoring of this decree.

64.

For a quality support in maatwerkbedrijven- and departments is
imperative that the supervisors on the shop floor are suitably qualified and
receive adequate training on their technical and social
skills.

65.

Because everyone has the right to work, right to a decent job on size creates
sp.a additional jobs in the social economy in local services,
customized business and custom departments.

Not for everyone in our society, it is possible to perform paid work in the mainstream
or social economy. Nonetheless, they may have benefit for each for a few hours or days
week unpaid and maintaining their distribution on a shop floor turning it (the
so-called "labor care"). Work is more than just an income: the structures of life, causes
Social contacts and boost the confidence and the skills of people. We
endorse fully the importance of this work-welfare programs (W²) as labor care.
66.

sp.a built along the course where everyone can be in the range of labor care
steps. For some, this labor care is a stepping stone to paid work in the
regular or social economy, for others it is directed to more permanent
work in labor care. The advisers of the various institutions (VDAB,
CPAs, CAW, mutual ...) function during such a project as a team together for the
individual guidance from both welfare and labor standpoint. Speaks
saying that people receiving unemployment benefit or income support during such
labor-care process must not lose their benefits. Degressivity also
unemployment benefits cease put during such a process.

67.

The next few years we want to organize the work more self-care initiatives
and development, in consultation with the sector legal framework. The guidance of the

29

persons in labor care from both work and welfare perspective is hereby
central. More clarity for the sector is the watchword.
68.

Persons who work permanently in the labor care, currently have a very
uncertain status. We want these people in full consultation with the industry
give statute, with an appropriate distribution (eg. income replacement
compensation or health and disability) insurance and if
necessary expenses (eg. for work clothes or commuting).

69.

The financial support from the labor department currently happening very
patchy, depending on the status of the person and the sector. We
establish a structured, uniform funding for both
labor health care workers as labor HMOs.

1.6 Working together for a good pension
Everyone should have a pension that prevents poverty and a comfortable life possible
makes.
Certainty about your retirement
Our pension system is built on cooperation: working people support themselves and
Others who retire financially. We therefore keep people working longer: we
make your retirement depends on the number of years after starting to work or start with
look for work. 42 years later, anyone who wants his or her statutory pension
request. Thus, we extend our careers in a righteous way and we provide more and
appropriate jobs. This is an economic necessity, because the population evolution and threaten more
more unfilled vacancies hit if we continue to see more elderly people over the head and their
talent after their 50th throw.
At the age of legal retirement, anyone who wishes to stop working and his or
receive her pension. This age let depend on the number of years after the start of the
Career: 42 years after the first job or enrollment at Gumtree, anyone who so desires or her
statutory pension request. With the current life expectancy of 42 years, the length of career
should suffice. As life expectancy continues to increase, 42 will not be sufficient in
far future. According to current expectations for longer life, will these 42 years in
earliest to be put in 2030 at 43 years.
The government must be prepared to pay the bill of aging by working more efficiently,
To allow more people to work and to organize a tax shift from labor to
capabilities, so that more people can get to work and contribute to the retirement of everyone.
But we face major challenges, both socially and economically. Therefore, we do extra
efforts mean working longer. We do not brash or sudden this: each person
should know from the age of 50 years, for example, at what age he or she can retire
go. Prolonged heavy work and collective closure or restructuring should remain part
30

exceptional arrangements as a safety net before retirement. The Pension reform
guarantees for a fair length of career and a dignified pension, solidarity
built up.
70.

Those who start working, or seeking employment, may retire 42 years later. Longer
work means more to contribute, and thus a higher pension.

71.

We let the government work with all workers to pension to everyone
guarantees: by paying part of the bill's pensions
government and by enabling longer work. From the age of 50 you should
know how many years you still work for you to retire.

Your pension, a full income
We improve the pension system so you lose less income when you retire.
Your pension should protect against poverty and our pension system needs the solidarity
between generations and between rich and poor make possible: this is a task for the whole society,
where we all have a role. Both the government and working people and retirees.
72.

You should be able to build up a pension equal to 75 percent
of your salary. The government makes this possible via the first, second and, where appropriate,
third pension pillar.

Every person who works actively looking for work or can not work because of illness or disability
must be able to build up a full pension in the first pillar on the basis of contributions by
workers and employers and the government. sp.a reserves the solidarity between those who work and can not
work, and among whom many and few deserve.
73.

We guarantee solidarity in pension contributions from employers,
employees and the government.

The pension in the first pillar should be done jointly. Firstly, this means that the
pension does not go entirely to their own retirement account when some people
exceed the salary ceiling. If you earn less than a bottom border, and to build so inadequate
pension, we will compensate jointly through the first pillar. This guarantees a
minimum pension for everyone who works and organize solidarity in a transparent
way. The ceiling of the total pension of 1st, 2nd and 3rd pillar is equated with the together
Current top officials retire.
Situations where you can not work, we equate a career year in which you pay
have earned. This means that when you are faced with illness or
Guests, if you are actively looking for work, or temporary care of a child or family member
you take your career and interrupts, you deserve an equation and further build up your pension.
If you are actively seeking work and receiving unemployment benefit, sick or disabled
and are entitled to an invalidity or for a limited time your career
interrupts to care for your young children or relatives, keep the
supplement retirement account.
31

74.

Those who can not work due to illness, temporary interruption or unemployment stays
accrue pension.

75.

sp.a wants the government continues to link the first pension pillar to the index and
lets follow the general welfare.

We activate a retirement account, where you can leave your total pension anytime
consult. Everyone who works actively looking for work or can not work due to illness, saves
a percentage of their annual salary (or past wages) on the pension bill. Your contributions
Meanwhile, bring in interest. It is up to the social partners to provide additional on top
pensions provide. This retirement account is completely transparent and shows what link there is
between your contributions and your pension. So you can make informed decisions during your
career, and in particular, at the end of your career.
The additional second pillar should be accessible to everyone who works. This means
we call social partners to channel extra pay margins to the second pillar. In the
primarily in sectors where today no supplementary pensions exist, but surely
even in sectors where workers or the creation of supplementary pensions terrible
is modest. Return on second pillar pensions should ensure that this form of
retirement savings remains worthwhile. Therefore, we assure the minimum as
today. A transparent and clear communication about the guaranteed annual reserves
the accumulated second pillar pensions is necessary. This is communicated, together with the
first pillar, so that people are properly informed at every age on the level of their
accrued pension.
76.

We generalize the second pillar pensions by giving them all
workers.

77.

On supplementary pensions in the second pillar we guarantee
minimum of 3.25 percent or 3.75 percent as today, to the
leave accrued pension in line with economic growth in the long
term. The tax benefit should be greater when the second pillar pension
is included in interest than for time recording in capital.

The private pension savings in the so-called third pillar, we still encourage fiscally exclusively
when the pension target of 75 per cent was not achieved in the first and second pillar
together. The third pillar can only supplement in periods where you work. The tax benefit
we limit to a nominal limit.
78.

All pension that exceeds the limit of 75 percent, we do not stimulate
more tax.

A dam against poverty
The income for the elderly (GRAPA) fills the accrued pension when you
have built up sufficient pension, and protecting you from poverty. Therefore we link
the IGO to the European poverty line.
32

79.

The income for the elderly (GRAPA) you should protect against poverty and
therefore lie above the European poverty line.

The IGO is not unconditional. That's why we bring other income sources (eg
power) in card that can meet your living expenses, with an exemption for their own
house and part of the savings. So the income will be available for those who feel
a dam needs against poverty.

1.7 Together strong for your purchasing power: Consumer Affairs and prices
Freedom and equality are the basis of a properly functioning market. In which there is only when the partners
that market are equal and decide freely. The market must, in other words also
works for the consumer, both in Belgium and in Europe.
Purchasing power, information and transparency
sp.a the last legislature shown that this only works if we actively intervene and betting
purchasing power and affordable products and services for all. Surveillance came on
pricing and advertising, so you get clear and honest information. We have the energy
broken open and encouraged people to compare prices. Did your bill considerably
decline. We verstrengden the rules surrounding consumer loans making usurious restricted
were laid and intrusive credit practices were countered. Furthermore, we have the industry
to give the assurances required crystal clear information about their offers, costs and
possible risks. There is also a unified ombudsman service for consumers and victims
today can together go to court to demand compensation. Finally
we organized group purchases in various domains of gas and electricity to isolation and
car insurance. Those purchases made a real difference for all who participated.
Much has happened in other words, but also in the future we will keep on the same course. We
remain committed to purchasing power, price transparency and information. Even in complex products
such as insurance and loans. This not only ensures that the market works, it also means that
you can compare services and products better and can make the best choice. Also with
Group purchases we move on. Because together we are stronger.

80.

We ensure that the prices of services and products that are important to
For example, live well, such as food, energy, heating and
Telecommunications are not higher than those in neighboring countries. We do this through the
recently reformed price observatory. The principle that the prices of the
essential goods should not be more expensive than in neighboring
countries will be laid down for wages in the law.

81.

We apply the mortgage so that you not only better protected
is, but there will also be more transparent fees and costs
home loans. We investigate whether a kiwi-model whereby banks offer
mortgage questions from citizens is workable.
33

82.

Even with insurance, we play better the market and we make change
easier. This allows you to tying without loss of discounts for you
a certain part were awarded to another insurer
change. Just like energy and telecommunications are also provided for insurance
tariff simulators and comparison modules. This allows you to better compare and best
making a choice.

83.

There will be a better monitoring of compliance with protection rules as a
home builds or when the owner of a building in the future
home. Through the so-called "presumption of lack 'of a consumer
in extending the (legal) warranty, we strengthen your consumer rights
and you can turn directly to the manufacturer.

84.

Everyone is aware of the link between health and nutrition. But
information about food is often incomplete, unclear and
complex. Therefore, you have more and better informed about your purchases.
There will be an improved European food label with simple and clear
information about materials and origin of the food. That label must clearly
give information about the origin, production and environmental impact.

85.

We ask the same ambiguity fixed by cosmetic products. Consumers
be unrealistic results presented in advertisements. The edited
Pictures undermine the self-confidence of women and men. The
clinical trials which reference is made, are not representative or even not to
find. We ask that the details of the investigation into the results of a
cosmetic product are clearly displayed in the ad. This
clarification is similar to the clear 'small print' in a
consumer credit.

86.

The different national enforcement bodies work more closely together so your
consumer rights throughout the European Union are protected. Belgian
example, you and other victims go to court to
to claim damages when European competition or
consumer rules are violated.

87.

The prices in our supermarkets are higher than in neighboring countries. One of
causes that vendors with its own rules divide the European market
higher prices charged to Belgian customers. European legislation has
we make that now impossible. The European market should be free to
everybody.

88.

We continue in the anchoring of Stronger Together and offer
Group purchases in each province. Thus, consumers and vulnerable
groups more financial breathing space.

Fight against debt

34

Debt problems cause much misery. They exclude the dependency and in many cases arm.
We see that more and more people struggling with excessive debt. If we therefore sp.a
the gauntlet. A fair and transparent market, prevention, quality explanations and
awareness are our guiding principles.

89.

There will be increased supervision of credit and loans to over-indebted
to prevent. Loans used to finance sustainable purchasing and not
to permanently to live on credit.

90.

With the increasing number of consumer loans and defaults therewith
go hand in hand, we want to better protect consumers against risks. We
impose exorbitant interest rates on bonds and prevent people from building up debts.
We purchased tickets on which you can buy on credit products
department stores. We limit the recruitment practices of banks that unsolicited
recipient to send publicity to sell according to new loans. We
put its efforts into the prevention and sensitization. The various instruments
there exist today, we vote better balance. We focus
also campaigns on young people. The number of young people with debts rising.
Therefore, we make young people at school already aware of consumer behavior and the
impact of debt by 'healthy financial behavior' to be included in the
education curriculum.

91.

Just as collection agencies fall bailiffs with debt now
under the control of the FPS Economy. The codes of ethics or internal
disciplinary procedures are not sufficient to eliminate excesses. Still
all kinds of costs for reminders, port or file format passed, while
you can not. In addition, we strengthen the mediation services so
bailiff need to be less involved.

Your electricity and gas bill
The battle for the customer has led to lower prices in the energy sector. Families and companies
already benefiting from appreciably lower costs. Thanks sp.a market was broken open. None
power company has more than half of the market. To be a really good
To have energy, it is better that no vendor yet over one third market share
going. In addition, should get at least two players is between 20 and 25 percent. The
several group purchases for energy, the campaign "Dare to compare," and the price freeze
proved their worth. By comparing prices and rates and consciously choose beneficial
suppliers, we have given a clear signal together. Suppliers who their customer number
saw reduce drastically so finally forced to play an active part in the
energy market. All vendors will from now on their cheapest rate annually individual
communicate, and you can switch immediately and free of charge at that rate. Only if the remains
market in motion and continues to play the competition. And just so you get the right price. We made
also ensure that the VAT rate for electricity was reduced. Electricity is not a
luxury product. Finally, since 2012 the distribution network tariffs blocked; this by pulling
2019 is an important component for controlling the electricity and gas bill.
35

92.

We continue on our momentum and keep strictly through independent regulators
monitoring of market prices. If the market does not work, we intervene again to the
rates to keep under control. We are still some way off. Control
energy prices, encouraging group purchasing and prices will remain in sp.a
the future is crucial.

93.

We count the social and sustainable energy no longer entirely through the
energy bill. We cap the contribution of our companies and households
for this policy at the current level by the freezing of
distributienettarrieven to extend until 2019 and the capping of federal
contribution. Extra costs we cover through general means such as income from
nuclear interest, revenue from the sale of CO² and uistootrechten
Entering the netvergoeding for solar panels.

94.

We make energy bills easier. Each vendor uses the same
standard invoice. So you can clearly see where the costs come from and you
compare prices more easily.

95.

We are expanding the social tariff for gas and electricity in all people
poverty. We refer firstly to those families who are entitled
the omniostatuut or families in individual or collective debt.

96.

The social rate for natural gas will also be accessible to people connected
on a collective heating system such as is often the case in
apartment buildings.

97.

More than a third of families with debt to the energy supplier
is not able to follow the repayment plan. This suggests that the debt too
the short term, to be paid off. This will drain to pay off the amount
per month high. sp.a wants payment plans with a realistic time frame.
There is not only the customer but also the supplier himself benefited.

98.

If an energy supplier requires a guarantee to a customer, never carry it
exceed two monthly advances and should be automatically
refunded if the consumer first year accounted pay on time.

Your GSM, Internet and television bill
The prices of mobile telephone subscriptions have recently plummeted. That is, thanks to the
sp.a work in the federal government. Thus, it is possible to after 6 months, a subscription
free to cancel or change in one day operator while keeping your number. On that
way you can save up to 50 percent on your bill. We note, however, that not all of those
decreases uses. The annual awards study by the independent regulator BIPT and the
rate simulator (www.bestetarief.be) are tools we use to keep better
compare. We have also ensured that you will be better protected: now you get a
free warning if you exceed your plan costs. Compare prices concerns
36

easier thanks to the required standard specifications for tariff plans. Finally lights operators now
active once a year on the BELFOR mule cheapest for you.
With Internet and television we see a lot less competition and prices are rising even. That's because
Operators often sell own equipment (a particular modem, or a TV decoder) linked to
their technology, and because prices are tied to the index. Again, we aim to lower
prices.
99.

When you charge switching to another operator light your new
operator as the old in a new energy supplier. So you will not
do duplication.

100.

At the rate simulator can directly insert your electronic invoice. So
you get quicker accurate information about the different rates and prices at
Your profile may apply.

101.

We are moving towards equipment-neutral technology, for example, only through
software so that competition between operators of television and
Internet services also leads to lower prices. This saves you from having another
buy other modem or set-top box.

102.

The Ethics Committee for Telecommunications continues to closely monitor and
acts against abuse of expensive telephone or expensive SMS numbers. The
ECT also controls the use of paid app on tablet and smartphone
where mainly young people use.

103.

The use of 4G, the latest generation of GSM technology that provides faster
traffic, should be rolled out across the country. Even in rural
fields, so that everywhere mobile data is possible.

104.

Anyone who has a right, gets an automatic granting of social
rate.

1.8 Social dumping disrupts our social security
The newspapers are full of stories about unfair competition from companies outside this country, ever
more bankruptcies and even the exploitation of foreign workers. Both the principle of the
European free (labor) market and the principle of social protection for all Europeans is
us is of great importance. First, we should not focus on our nationalities, but on the
protection of our social security. That means we do not abuse the mechanisms and
people have to deal with themselves.
A Europe without internal borders is an asset. The free market and the free movement of persons and
services has brought us all prosperity. But we must not close our eyes to the
flip side of the coin. The economic unification still is not accompanied by a social
harmonization. Between Member States remain large differences in terms of wages,
occupational safety, working hours, social security and social security rights. This leads
37

the strain on our social security, on our pay and working conditions and thus on our labor costs
systematically.
Secondment means that foreign workers employed for less than two years in another EU country
are employed or get a Belgian wages, but contributions (social security) in
the country of origin are due. Imperfect European market place so wide the door
open to abuse. By making clever use of the European legislation, does not contribute
and whether to pay decent wages, be legitimate businesses - those that do everything in line - and
workers priced out of the market. Our companies go bankrupt so, should firmly cut back or
move abroad. On the other hand employees lose their jobs if they are under pressure to
to work less favorable conditions (eg. via sham independent structures). Employees
work for wages that are much lower than the Belgian minimum wage. Call it even
dumping prices, because they often earn no more than six euros an hour ... gross! Furthermore, they work
in unsafe and unhealthy conditions, and they hit 60 or more hours per week. They enjoy
no social protection, no overtime get paid, do not leave and their
meager wages go high amounts on transport, housing and food. In certain cases
there is even talk of modern slavery. Moreover, this type of fraud is an insidious poison that our
social protection system and our economy is broken. Nobody wants to see a reduction in his wages,
no one wants to pay more if he goes to the doctor. Therefore, we must crack down on social
dumping to a halt.
Social dumping and unfair competition does not stop at the Belgian border. Others also
Member States in the EU are confronted. Such inequality is not working.
For us, the fight against social dumping and unfair competition a top priority. We have to
workers and businesses properly safeguard against such unfair competition. Whoever is here
employed must receive a fair wage and decent working conditions. This legal principle
exists but is not yet fully implemented and respected. It should be a permanent
focus for the inspection of all member states.
In cooperation with the unions and employers' organizations, we have different
legislative measures to combat unfair competition and social dumping. The
New legislation and action plan social dumping give us more clout. We carry more
coordinated control actions where the problems are greatest and where different
investigative services work together. This allows checks get really make an impact.
The problem of social dumping, unfair competition and exploitation clearly shows
Europe also needs a social story. It can not be that the profits of an enterprise
better protected than his employees. Besides the economic and political section, all
Europeans, both employees and entrepreneurs are better of a unified Europe. The
future is a Europe that binds us, which makes us all stronger.
With our program, we have an arsenal of measures to combat social dumping. We
focusing on better detection, a greater chance of being caught and a stronger and more effective punishment.

38

Only by working together, everyone will be both employee and entrepreneur - are dubious. To
progress work together with everyone and to the benefit of everyone.

105.

In the context of the fight against social dumping, we fight together. Who in our
land works, does so to the same pay and working conditions as all other
workers in our country. The government fights together with entrepreneurs and
workers against abuse. This requires an effort that should be rewarded.
Therefore, we find that a portion of the proceeds from the fight against
Social dumping must be returned to the sector. In this way, the
competitiveness of legitimate businesses and workers strengthened.

Avoid social dumping
We want clear rules and administrative simplification. Cooperation between the
various inspection services, including the European, should be intense. A general exchange of information is crucial, alongside standardization and electronic exchange of social documents
and certificates. We must reveal fraud, identify and combat by all means.

106.

Clear, create uniform rules, with a minimum of administrative
burdens on businesses and workers, are the best insurance against fraud.
Therefore we make our labor and our social security work
a legal and administrative simplification.

107.

At European level we are aiming for administrative simplification. Overly
often administrations and enterprises are faced with a
nuisance forms, certificates and documents that are as diverse as the
28 EU Member States. That complicates control and works misuse and forgery
in the hand. sp.a wants standardized electronic social documents
certificates for the entire European Union. Payslips, discharge forms,
employment certificates
Unemployment documents
and
ziekteof
disability forms across the Union should have the same form and content
and Member States need to exchange smoothly.

108.

The fight against social dumping, we only win by the Posting of Workers Directive
fundamentally revised. We get rid of the gray zone, created by the
tangle of subcontracting and posting to social protection
bypass. Europe opts for the protection of workers with a simple
basic principle is effectively enforced: those who work in another country does
this to the same working conditions as workers in that country.

109.

The government is showing a good example and take responsibility. At
public procurement is systematically checked whether the companies a
tender submitted comply with the rules on working conditions
and social protection in our country. Also this European principle is maintained.
We work closely together with the inspectorates of the different Member States

39

so we have been told that foreign companies play by the rules
hold.
Detection and investigation of social dumping
In the fight against social dumping and unfair competition, the focus of all levels of government
in the first place on detection, investigation and prosecution of serious infringements. Infringements associated
keep internal disturbance, with flagrant abuse and exploitation. Nonetheless
that we need to penalize less serious offenses quickly and efficiently. They also want at European level
we unconditionally reinforce the control measures and joint liability
Entering general. Europe must give us the space to also act in their own country.

110.

Our entrepreneurs and inspection services often face
suspect counterfeit A1 certificates - which the submission of a secondment to
a foreign social security system have to prove - and may
recently these certificates disregard. We like this Belgian
anti-abuse measure included in a European legislative framework. Thereby
we shed no barriers against the free movement of persons and services,
but against the abuse that sometimes accompanies it.

111.

We can determine undeclared work much easier when people work in
show detail. There exist user-friendly methods. Let those
both employees and employers to register to performance and let
secondly check inspection services quickly and efficiently. sp.a wants
obligation of registration yard spread to all sectors. Eventually, these
Registration also working - and not just the presence - contents.

112.

We want to increase the probability of detection of rogue traders. That's why we want
organize our inspection services in a better way. The
detection methods to improve efficiency, the selection mechanisms for control
be further optimized. We also need capacity
inspection preserve or, if necessary courage to expand. Thanks to this
total exercise, we increase the impact of our inspection on the premises.

113.

When an inspector discovers social fraud, it takes a lot of time in research,
prosecution or punishment. Meanwhile, fraudsters work just
continue. Trucks drive on, construction workers build and
cleaners and continue cleaning. That can not be right. When
social dumping aggravates an infringement sp.a finds that the inspection speed
the activities must cease. The yard is sealed, the truck
will be shut down on the chain or belt. That is an immediate action
the fraudster feel clear.

114.

sp.a wants social inspection of national and regional governments
betting on more risk selection, on even greater cooperation and more
presence on the ground. There is a need for greater monitoring and enforcement of
compliance with applicable wage and working here. Inspection Services
40

must exchange information for a coordinated fight against abuse.
Intensive cooperation between the inspection services of the Member States is therefore
a must.
115.

sp.a will work at European level, making an intensive cooperation
between the authorities of Member States. When the boundaries of a fraud
State cross national inspectorates are too often powerless.
Therefore we want the creation of a 'Eurosoc "a European social
inspection network, information sharing, cross-border investigation and
facilitates joint action. "Eurosoc 'can also have operational responsibilities. So
it can verify the authenticity of A1 certificates and revoke them if necessary
or check wages across borders.

116.

sp.a wants the inspectorates their access to IMI (international market
make information system) system further operational. IMI is an international
system that provides information about the sending company and the posted
employees. IMI is a solution to a number of important practical
problems such as differences in administrative and working culture, language and
uncertainty about the caller. In addition, we also want to
social security with a comparable IMI system.

Prosecution and sanctioning of social dumping
Who is obstinate and fraud undermines our employment and our social security system, which must
feel. That means controls, where breaches are identified, leading to
(investigation and prosecution. Offenders should we punish where we do it
Hardest hit: by taking away their economic benefit. Loses a malicious company
then permits, get a trade ban or be banished from a sector. A solid
Punishment is a clear signal that we will not tolerate abuse, not the system and certainly
not from humans. Because human trafficking is a persistent and extremely difficult to eradicate
problem. Therefore, we believe in a multi-disciplinary approach and strengthen international
collaboration.

117.

The detection and control of abuse and fraud is one thing that fraud
prosecute and punish is another matter. There should be administrative and
get a clear criminal prosecution policy, with serious cases of
social fraud a priority. sp.a advocates a sanctioning framework
serious infringements to associate equally heavy sanctions. Less serious infringements
We combine penalties to be applied especially fast and efficient passes are. The focus
prosecution and sanction should be one in all areas and at all levels of government
his attention.

118.

Principals and contractors should we liable faster in
case of serious infringements. This applies to breaches of occupational safety and
working conditions, but also to poor housing Seconded
employees. Principals and contractors we criminally
liable not only for the correct payment of wages but also for
41

social and fiscal liabilities of subcontractors. That way they can not on
way shirk their responsibility.
119.

The victims of social dumping is not only our own entrepreneurs and
employees, but also the foreign workers here for a
starvation wage and working under poor conditions. They too deserve our
protection. After they are identified by inspection, they are often
quickly deported. Those foreign workers - often victims
of loondiefstal- should have the opportunity for a brief period in our country
remain. So the inspection can try to complete their dossier,
For example, the wages lost - and lost contributions - to calculate and
recover. The exploited worker can claim that way
on his back wages.

120.

Rarely go our courts on a case of suspected human trafficking.
That while inspectorates regularly uncover human trafficking. sp.a wants
clear and workable definition of the concept of human trafficking in the law. On
A non-exhaustive way, but specific enough, we need to describe what we
understood in inhuman conditions. Thus, inspection services,
magistrates and courts prosecute the offense much better.

121.

Many business owners are eligible for tax cuts on wages and
employment subsidies. That's a good thing. But when companies
convicted of benefit fraud to favor measures that the company
previously was often forgotten. Entrepreneurs who for serious fraud - such as
For example, social dumping - have been convicted should be in addition a sanction all
social and tax advantages which they enjoyed to repay the
various authorities and may for a certain period in the future
are excluded.

1.9 On a progressive and social Europe
The recent history of the European Union shows that together it makes a difference and that
we are all worse off if it does not happen. The European cooperation
not only ended a centuries-long period of wars, Europe has become one of the
most prosperous regions in the world made with the strongest social protection and the highest
standard of living in the world. The EU is a unique partnership based on values ​​such as freedom,
equality and solidarity. It is these values ​​that attract people from outside the Union.
Tyranny and injustice have no place, the death penalty has been abolished here here, violence
against women and children we find reprehensible, child labor is illegal, gays can freely
cohabitation and citizens are protected against government censorship. The shared desire for
social justice, protection against social risks and understanding that equal access to
education, health and livelihoods are necessary; that's what makes Europe unique.
From these values, we continue to advocate and supporter of a strong European Union.

42

Europe has proven its added value. Thanks to cooperation at European level we are
Today forerunners in the field of environmental protection, climate change and food security. Due to
Europe we combine the strongest consumer rights in a well-functioning market. Due to
Europe we can travel freely within the borders of the Union, work and live where we want.
All these achievements could not perform on their own European countries.
Working together makes the difference: this is the philosophy behind the European project. But we seem
lately to have been forgotten. The unique European socioeconomic model that gives us the highest
prosperity and quality of life in the world led thrown so to cheapen. Economic freedoms
take precedence over social justice. Unbridled capitalism in the financial industry plunged us into
the worst crisis since the thirties. Tax provokes nationalism countries in a race to the bottom
which eventually are only losers. A bleak economic policy is focusing solely on numbers
forgets that policy matters people. The economy must serve society, not
vice versa.

A strong spirit of solidarity and social union
Europe experienced since the Second World War, an unprecedented economic growth for more
ensured prosperity and equality. The growing middle class was the engine of progress.
Regardless of whether you're running a business, was maid or teacher, offered social welfare
everyone a fair deal. If you work well, you got a fair wage and could count on a solid
safety net if it went wrong. You got the chance to buy a home, saving for your retirement and above
opportunity to give your children a better future. This is Europe's most
prosperous regions created the world and referred memories of war and poverty continental
and adversity in the past.
The European promise of peace and prosperity endured until now every storm. Today State
promise under severe pressure. The European dream threatens to turn into a nightmare. Europe
is now more associated with crisis and the highest unemployment rate in 20 years. The
unemployment gap between North and South has doubled and income inequality in the EU
Today the same size as those in the United States. Indeed, between EU Member States it is
greater than that between the US states.
Fiscal and social competition between Member States, the welfare state is building and allow its citizens the price
to pay for the crisis. The outlook is bleak: slow growth, persistent unemployment and
growing inequality. This will also increase the pressure to our economy greener and more sustainable
finish.
The question we must ask ourselves is whether we want more Europe or less Europe, but what
European Union we want. The Union is particularly economic and monetary. The manner in which the
economic crisis is addressed, is one example. There was only room for hard
economic measures: save, cut back and reduce social gains. Hereby
we would be competitive again. It seems that the race to become of the world China
deployed with the lowest taxes and the weakest social security. But this is a race we
43

never win and our boat to the future does miss. The European
saving policy prevents that we focus on innovation and investment in people and in
infrastructure. By the dogmatic focus on savings, we also lose our competitive slowly
advantage in terms of quality products with high added value. The
negative effects of globalization are enhanced by current policies, while the position of
Europe weakened in the world.
The crisis of recent years is not only economic. Through such policies, the Union will lose
also systematically support its population. Confidence in the European institutions had never
so low.
Europe needs to re-offer the people a future. Only then will confidence
follow. We should again ensure that Europe for its citizens European promise
delivers. The promise of a better life for each new generation and the promise of a
progressive, more equal and more prosperous Europe. A Europe with quality jobs and a
strong safety net for when things go wrong. Europe must defend the welfare state further
develop and give real meaning to the social democratic slogan that the Union will be social or
will not be.
There is no future for the European Union unless it is social. Every European should have a guaranteed
minimum to have social protection with universal access to health care,
income and social security. So away with the growing phenomenon of working
poor and unfair competition between Member States. Europe must strictly guard efforts
States to poverty, unemployment and inequality counter. Just as they now do for the
budgets of its member states.
We strive for a European Union with binding social objectives and common social
standards. This not only Europeans with few social rights benefit. Even countries with a
highly developed system of social protection be better here. It puts an end to
unfair competition where Member States compete with cheaper labor
which enjoy little or no social protection.
Spearheads a strong, united and social union is a resolute approach
Youth unemployment, binding targets to combat poverty, the introduction of a
European minimum wage, the fight against social dumping, fiscal harmonization and a more social
Budgetary.
Resolute to tackle youth unemployment
Today, 5.6 million young people are unemployed in the European Union. While we are a dizzying
1600 billion spent to save the banks, barely 8 billion was made available
for our youth. Youth unemployment in the Eurozone is more than 23 percent. In countries
such as Spain and Greece even around 60 percent. Why are we prepared our banks, but not
save our youth? Such figures are dramatic for every society. They lay a mortgage
in the future and threaten an entire generation of young people to be lost. Youngsters who
Always wear a scar, with lower wages and lower social benefits. But a generation
44

always will cherish distrust towards the political and economic system. The social
risks of massive youth In other words, greater than that of a failing
banking system.
Tackling youth unemployment is not is not only socially irresponsible, it is above all
economic folly. The damage to the European economy is estimated at 150 billion euros
per year. A paltry 8 billion is spread over the next seven years against this
background no more than a fig leaf. Initiatives such as a true European youth internship
Youth training not only provide much added value to those concerned, but carry on
term also contribute to improved labor mobility within the Union.

122.

We invest in the future of our youth. A vigorous European approach
youth unemployment which we target the first work experience
desperately needed. As with the rescue of the banks, we provide as many resources as
need every European youngster within four months after his or her studies, a
first to offer work experience.

123.

The recognition of diplomas in the Union will be extended and harmonized.
The Union also provides language training vouchers to labor mobility
to increase over the borders.

124.

Projects such as Erasmus + have our continued support. They make it possible to
in studying abroad, training, work experience or
to volunteer. Everyone should have the chance to be in a
exchange step. So make young Europeans not only knowledge
with each other, but also develop their talents and accelerated
increase their chances of employment.

The fight against poverty is a top priority
The fight against poverty and social exclusion is one of the five priorities in the context of the
EU2020 strategy. The crisis caused by the banks and a lax regulatory policy, costing
However, one in four Europeans today with an increased risk of poverty or social
exclusion. That's almost 120 million Europeans. As many as one in three children is growing in Europe
in deprivation. This is the most prosperous continent of the world completely
unacceptable. If we continue the trend of recent years, we see that the objective
20 million people have less poverty will not pick up in 2020, but not until 2150.
The European approach to the crisis starts from narrow macroeconomic targets and a cold
saving policy. This undermines the fight against poverty rather than strengthen them. Europe
Today a negative impact on the poverty while strengthening the social
protection would benefit the whole Union.

125.

Every European should have a minimum level of social protection
universal access to health care, social security and social security.
45

We seek to have a general right to a minimum income poverty
takes the European Union.
126.

sp.a continues to fight further against poverty and social protection in the
center of European policy. The economic policies conducted today
is focused too narrowly on activation, it is also inadequate
effective. sp.a wants a more comprehensive approach to poverty
in European policy. The priorities identified by the Commission in its Social
Investment Package sets, namely social protection, education, social
innovation and accessible and affordable services such as childcare
spearheads the fight against poverty. The National Reform Programme
which must be submitted annually by each Member State in Europe and now a
sided focus on economy and saving places the fight against poverty should be much
more visible in the light of the EU2020 objectives. The participation of the
poverty organizations must be guaranteed in this through a structural
anchoring of the Belgian Platform against Poverty.

127.

Now 20 percent of the European Social Fund is explicitly reserved for
the fight against poverty and social exclusion, the European Commission, when
Member States shall ensure - and this guide them - that means also effective
be used for that purpose.

128.

We reaffirm our full support to the Fund for European assistance to the
most deprived and continue to advocate the expansion of its budget.
Today more people than ever are indeed in Europe depends on
dispensation of food and other basic resources.

A European minimum income guarantees everyone a good life
Who works must make ends meet with his salary. In most EU countries, there is a
minimum wage, whether or not sectoral. The relative amount of these minimum wages varies
strong. The highest minimum wage (Luxembourg) is as much as six times higher than the lowest
minimum wage (in Romania). Anything can buy a Romanian with his minimum wage, one can
Luxemburger with its minimum purchase six times. This difference lies an important social
injustice.

129.

Every European who works must make ends meet with his salary. There should be with
In other words, a sufficiently high minimum be that long-term
is the same in all Member States. The lack of a European minimum wage puts moreover
the internal market under pressure. It leads to unfair competition within the EU.
A European minimum wage provides social justice, social protection
and ensures fair competition. In the short term, each Member State
obliged to guarantee a minimum wage of at least 60 percent of the
Median income in that State.

Equal rights in the labor market: the European fight against social dumping
46

We are in favor of free movement of persons and services: every citizen of the Union
that is, should be able to work freely in the EU. But the movement should not be an excuse for social
organize dumping. Anyone who does the same job in the same country must do to it
current employment conditions of that country. Employing people on a low wage, in
poor working conditions and without proper social protection is unworthy of Europe. That
in fact leads to a social "race to the bottom" that has only losers. Social dumping does not
Only a system of working poor but also to unfair competition with
companies that do follow social rules. The loss of jobs, the bankruptcy of fair
businesses and the destruction of our social protection is the result.
As explained in the above piece put on social dumping, you can not have this problem
single national resolve, too European, this should be a priority (see section s 1.8). A
Social Europe gives all Europeans protection. The current revision of the Enforcement Directive
taking steps in the right direction, but sp.a continues: the same work in the same Member State must
done the same conditions and make visible dumping a European inspection network
and fight with all means. Who is obstinate and exploitation and social shopping us
economic fabric and undermining our employment that must feel. That means that
checks can lead to investigation and prosecution. Where we punish offenders
hurts: we pick the most economically advantageous way. A firm rebuke is the clearest signal
that we will not tolerate abuse. Not from the system and certainly not people.
We invest in Europeans
We need to reinvest in people. In the economic governance of Europe's social needs
dimension at least as important as the budget. Reducing
unemployment, poverty and social exclusion is key. With the same zeal as the European
Commission scrutinizes budgets, we also need the European targets around
realize education and poverty. The social cohesion of the Union is a top priority which is also the
Commission should carry out. This requires a social and progressive pact needed. A pact based on
social dialogue and parliamentary scrutiny. A pact that investing in human capital and bet on
employment, training, education and social cohesion.

130.

Fiscal policy takes into account investments. In the calculations of
the structural deficit of Member States' clear forward-looking
investments of those Member States in employment, innovation, training and education
a different weighting.

131.

Currently, the EU is the most attention for its economic and
monetary objectives. This, at the expense of its social objectives,
shabbily treated. sp.a calls on deadline for attention
Social aspects are enshrined in the European treaties and insists
that Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is being converted into a real
Economic, Social and Monetary Union (ESMU), the economic, social and
monetary objectives treats at the same height.

47

132.

European policies should not only focus on fiscal targets. We
in addition to the fiscal compact to a European Social Pact. That must
objectives on employment, innovation, education, poverty alleviation and
social cohesion as agreed in the EU2020 Strategy enforceable. Just
As with the European control on the budgets will not pull it from the
sanctioned targets. So it's not just about the result but
also providing adequate resources for the Social Pact but also
other basic pillars such as justice. For lack of sufficient investment in these
Domains is not a just society possible. Finally, we link the
objectives to the multiyear budget so we also policy
support the necessary European funds. These funds should be substantially
expanded by cheap ECB loans by a financial transaction tax,
and through the collection of taxes to be avoided now
tax havens.

133.

The Social Pact is central to the annual analysis made by each Member State
is and forms the basis for penalty procedures and recommendations. It should
also take into account the evolution of poverty,
employment, health, investment in education, innovation, and the
imbalances in social protection between the Member States. That is, we
besides the figures also take into account the content and social sustainability
of the policy. The link between national budgets and the targets of the
Pact must be strong. Only if we make room for investment
employment, education, innovation and the fight against poverty.

134.

sp.a want a strong Commission that social policy is central and
carries. At the beginning of the legislature, the European Parliament is mandatory
recommendations which the Commission takes into account when developing
legislation. The incoming Commission then presents a detailed
multiannual program which is updated annually and asks that
whenever the confidence of Parliament.

An inclusive Europe
In recent years it has become painfully clear that the currency union is unfinished. Welfare states in the
Eurozone are their individual capacity to act as a stabilizer in times of crisis for a piece
lost. The lack of full-fledged economic cooperation not only did the euro, but also
countries in the South on the brink of collapse. The focus on budgetary and macroeconomic imbalances overshoot to the fact that a monetary union also must show solidarity.

135.

A monetary union requires all Member States responsibility. A desirable
budget strategy for the eurozone as a whole consists necessary
remediation projects to be implemented in Member States with unhealthy public finances. Which
need to be spread over time, taking into account the economic
short-term impact. At the same time, we need Member States who can oblige
tax incentives to provide to the deflationary forces of other Member States as against
48

to go. We therefore foresee a European insurance mechanism against
economic shocks. To support the social pact will be a separate
budget stabilization for the Eurozone. This budget will help Member States to shocks
capture and implement socially responsible reforms.
136.

The mandate of the European Central Bank is too restrictive today. The
objective of price stability to be supplemented with the objectives of
maximum employment and moderate long-term interest rates.

137.

Finally, it should also be the effect of the ECB's transparency and democratic
expired. The chairman is confirmed by the European Parliament and its
reports and the results of voting of the Board of Directors
made public.

The strongest shoulders bear the heaviest burdens in Europe
Proposals for increased investment and the development of a social agenda encounter always the same
mantra: there is no money. The so-called lack of funding is used to
to justify dismantling of the welfare state. Taxation, however, is the domain par excellence from which
the failure shows the current European construction. This lack of harmonization
shopping behavior possible for companies and the Member States will play against each other. We want this
prevent European tax by imposing minimum standards. EU countries In addition, walking on
all levels all year 1.000 billion loss of revenue through tax avoidance and
tax evasion. That is 2,000 euros per European. It is more than all the countries in the EU
together spend on health care. Money that we can not invest in employment and
education.
A properly functioning internal market means that we make good and clear agreements on how
we tax companies in that market. This is the only way to avoid that they are on a large scale
paying little or no contributions. Fiscal shopping creates unfair competition between
companies that pay their contributions and those who do not. EU citizens also believe this
shuttled billions unfair. Surely now they will be asked to make additional efforts to
combat crisis.

138.

On the fiscal side, we finally introduce harmonization. With a European
minimum rate, no company can still evade taxes.

139.

Addressing tax havens and the abolition of banking secrecy must
not only at the European level, but also individually or in any Member State
under a bilateral agreement. We do this by focusing on transparency,
the same criteria, a European blacklist and fully automatic information exchange. Only if we know which companies earn and how much.

140.

There are European anti-abuse rules. Thus we punish fraud,
tax evasion and avoidance, and we charge based on the economic
reality.

49

141.

We support the introduction of a financial transaction tax at European level, and
use the proceeds allocated to Belgium to ease the burden on
reduce labor here.

If there is already talk in Europe of two speeds, which is not about 'poor South' opposite
'rich North', but about a widening gap between rich and poor Europeans, wherever they
live. A social Europe must be based on solidarity, the strongest shoulders should
wear heaviest loads. We reaffirm the proven social democratic recipe
redistribution in order to spread the wealth more equitably between all citizens of the Union. A Union that there
work create can always count on the support of sp.a. The current policy of the European Union

2 THE ECONOMY TO TURN FOR YOU
2.1 Introduction: Together we give oxygen to our economy
A strong social welfare state rests on solid economic foundations. The saving logic,
who spent more than five years the dominant political response to the crisis in Europe, this undermines
foundations and causes anxiety. They mortgaging our future prosperity. Increasingly
Europeans are affected by these harsh austerity: massive youth unemployment, increasing poverty and inequality. In Belgium, the Socialists in the government
for a different sound. We strengthen our social model, instead of breaking it down. We
investing in people, and especially those who need it the most. It is no coincidence that Belgium
and Flanders, and our businesses and small businesses, the crisis relatively well have passed.
We make our economy and society stronger by investing together and work together. So
we assure our future. That also means investing in companies and entrepreneurs, as it
employers and employees together to spin our economy and give oxygen. On that
how we create future prosperity, quality jobs and growth that benefits everybody
becomes.
The choices we make now at a tipping point between investment and breakdown, determine our
future. We make choices in the goals and make that clear. A first objective is the
stabilization and sustainability of our economy. A second objective is competition
in a number of sectors to address even better. Often it is the smaller companies there
the victims. Again we bring more certainty.

142.

We simplify the tax system and provide tax certainty. We do this by
complexity in the tax regulations to match. The complexity of our
Taxation is a recurrent theme among entrepreneurs. Simple
solutions, rates and tax bases are not always obvious. Often
Exceptions very specific and quite rightly so. It is for the tax authorities to this
complexity to address and relieve entrepreneurs.

143.

We resolutely for addressing societal challenges. We
promoting the reduction of raw materials and energy. We boost
logistics processes that reinforce Belgium as a logistics hub. We move
existing business support to the priorities in the longer term for more
prosperity and well-being concerns. We encourage entrepreneurial start-ups by the
existing measures to ensure risks to further strengthen. Finally
sp.a remains resolutely opting for corporate social responsibility. This
means that employers pursue a policy that deliberately account
economic, social, ecological and cultural consequences in the short and long term.
It is transparency and continuous dialogue with all stakeholders
crucial importance.

51

144.

In Belgium and Flanders, we have strong large and smaller companies.
Yet our country has low levels of entrepreneurial. Many people hesitate a
Starting Your Own Business. When the probability of failure is by growing small. There goes much
knowledge and expertise of lost entrepreneurship. Local entrepreneurs and
self-employed are, however, crucial for the future of industrial activity
and the manufacturing sectors in Belgium, and for anchoring quality jobs.
That is why we are strengthening the policy second chances for entrepreneurs in Belgium.

145.

When it comes it will often take on larger companies and their
profitability and employment. Less attention the smaller gain
stores which often play an important social role in a district
or a neighborhood. Look for example at newsagents, butchers or bakers. Also for
them it is not easy to stay straight. Therefore, we strengthen profitability
of small business owners and self-employed.

146.

Under pressure from sp.a we have with the Belgian bankenwet important steps
put to the speculation and exuberant bonuses in the banking world
suits. Even better with the bankenwet we protect the savings of
saver. But this is not the end point. We take a fundamentally different
banking model with high capital buffers and strong consumer and
regulators. A sustainable system in which banks again do what they
should do: savings securely manage and provide oxygen to the economy. So
also get the small and alternative players the opportunities they deserve.

2.2 A fiscal reform work
A progressive tax system is a basic requirement for an economy that works for everyone. 'The
strongest shoulders bear the heaviest burden 'is an ethical principle that we are highly valued
wear. To achieve this principle, Belgium needs a major reform of the
tax organize better.

147.

A progressive tax is a fair tax system. Our first priority is
everyone contributes fairly. We get the money who are not or too little
pay. So we ensure that you pay less tax.

We make the tax system simpler by the administration to enable it to become a
real service, rather than an adversary. Our goal is a better flow of
Information as many people and businesses to a pre-completed tax return
delivery.
We want to bring the tax burden on labor and capital in balance, with the dual aim to jobs
create and make work pay. We achieve this through a capital contribution,
loopholes in the taxation power plug and the progressivity of the tax system better power
organizes.

52

We want to fill the holes that have beaten the crisis, with the final goal of the growth path for the
crisis to find and attract employment levels sustainably. That will allow us
to further reduce taxes on low and middle incomes.
We want a tax system that allows balanced growth by discouraging speculation and sustainable
support investment. We achieve this through the European Financial Transaction Tax, a
reform of the tax on stock options, and an internal shift within the
CIT.
At the international level we seize the opportunities that currently exist. Never was
tolerance for evasion by large corporations and wealthy so low. We therefore fully support
the initiatives developed in various international bodies, and urge rapid
execution.
Simplification: The tax authorities as a service
The tax bill is for many families and businesses a complicated tangle where a cat hair
boy no longer find back. Completing the tax bill is not only every year
time-consuming task complexity also increases the risk of errors. Errors that then another
could lead to additional procedures and extra costs. Especially for those who are not expensive tax adviser
can afford.
To simplify our tax system thoroughly, we are running the current practice completely.
The tax is then completed by the administration. Which will have access to all
the information he needs. In return, business owners and their families need tax write no more
self-administered and do not need to be no more controlled. Take legal
increased substantially. With this method, the tax authorities will be much more transparent and
accessible to you.
The average taxpayer too are profiting from that approach. You are not only got rid of a lot
red tape, you can count on enjoying the deductions and rebates
where you are entitled to. Many people are unaware that they can deduct certain expenses. In many
cases administrative costs are so high that there is a Matthew effect: measures come
do not go to people who can use them most. By the administration to the declarations
to fill that inequality is eliminated.
Several countries prove that a (quasi) declaration free society is possible. In Denmark
For example, 90 percent of people do nothing to alter the by the taxman
proposed assessment. And it's not associated with a more expensive tax. On the contrary,
measured by cost per euro tax collected, the Danish administration, Skatt, one of the
cheapest in Europe.
Taxpayers with the pre-completed tax return not only an administrative burden off,
for many one of the most irritating chores of the year, but also have no more control
expect. They are in order, they can sleep on their two ears.

53

The impact on the audit of the administration is also smaller. There is no reason
to which transparency has gone into its income and agree to its
tax bill, check yet. The tax administration can be a lot of people and resources
more effective use. The focus of the audits is almost exclusively on the segment where non-compliance is greatest.
We hope this approach not only to enter for individuals and self-employed,
but also for small and medium enterprises. Who wants to can abandon control
by the administration to give full access to its books and records to third parties. The
administration makes a proposal of assessment and approval of the company given the certainty
that this attack will not later be challenged.

148.

We make the tax declaration as much as possible free. Families, professionals and
companies make their declarations by the Administration to fill free of charge
Based on all available relevant information to the tax authorities. For
companies where a free tax return is not feasible, we reserve the
existing obligations for a correct tax return.

In exchange for such transparency for the taxpayer, you may expect that the
administration you can quickly answer questions about the tax consequences of certain facts and
actions. When families and businesses here have certainty, they can make their
better business plans.

149.

In exchange for this extensive transparency for families and
businesses, the administration must be able to quickly and efficiently
answers questions from taxpayers about the tax consequences of
their actions.

Shift: a tax on job creation
Everyone agreed that costs at work in Belgium are too high. Therefore we propose a double
shift: from taxes on labor to capital gains, incomes in the white sector
the gray and black economy.
If we want to realize substantial burden shift the economy to grow again. That
is the only way to get the public finances on a sustainable order.
The ongoing European financial crisis and affected the growth potential of the economy and
endangers the health of long-term public finances at risk. According to estimates
by international institutions our economy is already 8 percent poorer than it was possible for the crisis
considered. Is also the growth rate of our economy much too low: 1.2 percent is too little to the
public finances healthy. Return to growth before the crisis - a minimum
goal - to improve public finances already sensitive.

54

150.

Growth and employment are the best way to get the budget in order.
We want to close the holes that have beaten the crisis, with the aim of at least the
growth path can be found for the crisis and the employment rate durable
to pull up. We stand with the careful and responsible
government spending. That does not mean we have to mortgage our future
and our collective impoverished population from statistics alone. Investments in
growth measures pay for themselves. Indebtedness need to reduce
by saving where needed, including through a more efficient government action,
but also by ensuring that tomorrow more than today deserves. spa
to save when the economy allows, in good times. This realistic
recipe should enable us to 2020 government spending 50
percent of our collective prosperity, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), to
and bring the debt ratio over time under 60 percent of GDP.

The next government should further reduce the burden on labor than it is in the competitiveness pact
agreed. The objective is a priority to support the employment of low-skilled and
To strengthen purchasing power of low and middle incomes. Specifically, we want these measures
take:

151.

The structural reduction in employer's needs for low priority
incomes to be increased further, so we unskilled labor cheaper
and create employment opportunities for people who are struggling to have a job
find increase. The general wage subsidy in the payroll tax can
be abolished. The objective is the percentage of people with employer
a minimum wage to bring back to a symbolic 5 percent.

152.

We are strengthening actions around the purchasing power of the competitiveness pact by
deepening the system of work and broaden bonus for low and
middle incomes. Social and fiscal work bonus can be merged
one tax that has already been settled in the payslip via the
payroll. The special contribution to social security can be
abolished.

We believe that by appealing to capital income, we go down the burden on labor
can get without the bill yet to relay back to your family. Recent data show
which over the euro zone only in Spain the disparity in financial assets is greater than in
Belgium.
We also know that the major loopholes that remain in our capital tax, as
the exemption on capital gains in equities and equity funds and international
tax havens used by the wealthiest. In France are 97 percent
the capital gains realized by the 10 percent highest incomes.

55

153.

These measures can we fund when we consistently go further
closing loopholes in the capital tax, as the tax on
gains on shares and continue to focus on combating fraud and use
of the proceeds from the financial transaction tax.

Unlike taxes on labor are charges on capital gains in Belgium flat taxes. We
try the small saver or to indulge with the exemption on savings accounts with low interest rates, but
that exemption is largely the bench for good. A major reform is effective
forming introduce progressivity, so that small savers can be spared, and the most
the wealthy may be required a greater contribution.

154.

We ask for a greater contribution from those who currently have a small contribution
supply. We do this by closing loopholes and effective
to introduce progressivity in the tax power. In this way,
we the small saver and better sparing of the wealthiest greater
Questions contribution. A capital contribution to these objectives efficiently
reach.

155.

Other instruments would not be appropriate to reduce the burden on labor. The
VAT is not an appropriate instrument to ease the pressure on wages because she is
regressive and erodes the real purchasing power of wages and replacement incomes indirectly
out.

156.

What applies to VAT, is also true for environmental taxes. When an ambitious
Environment Policy is still necessary to increase environmental expenditures
we compensate people with low and modest incomes up to
lost purchasing power, and so that no adverse social impacts occur.
Environmental charges only serve to improve the environment, not to burden
shift from rich to poor.

157.

We ensure that the antisocial lump environmental impact at every level
abolished, and yet if necessary replace it with a social
corrected environmental impact.

In combating fraud, we have quite realize what the share of the shadow economy
GDP has fallen in Belgium. Nevertheless, a sustained effort will be needed, since fraud
is a market disruptive, unfair shifting of the cost of public goods to those who
have no possibility of evasion. The Treasury annually is 30 billion euros by wrong
fraud.

158.

Every cent which is extracted from Fraud we give a
reducing the burden on labor.

A tax benefit of young families

56

We see today that young people do not have it financially easy, even those who work
have. They have forced increasingly example, continue to live with their parents. We give
younger people more opportunities to stand on their own feet and to shape their own lives.
The tax on property we create fairer. Young families a decent
want to buy modest home, are already facing high prices and encounter
more and more difficulties in getting a secure loan. We reduce registration fees for
starters so that home ownership no privilege in the future that is only reserved for the
rich. We also make sure that people who want to move because they change or out of work
each will be penalized by double taxation.

159.

We are increasing the exemption (the abatement), the registration fees for the
purchase of the first and only home. We also extend the principle of the
portability from that move is not hampered tax.

We also give them a financial boost at the start of their careers. In this way
we realize a flatter wage and create space for the accumulation of seniority to
reform.

160.

We increase the allowance for anyone who has an earned income
and is not yet thirty years. With this we give young people further opportunities effectively. To
Avoid Getting young people on their thirtieth abruptly confronted
higher taxes, the allowance for young people is gradually
brought back to its normal level between their 30 and 35 years.

A tax benefit of balanced and social growth
The credit crisis has shown that financial markets alone is not always the right choices
make. In many cases, investments are done for speculative reasons, which have nothing to do
had long-term with an underlying return. The result was not only that we
make a major crisis were we still not been overcome, but also that
investment that would pay off in time, not have happened.
The tax system can contribute to a more sustainable, long-term economy. A
financial transaction tax will contribute to more stable financial markets, because they are speculative
transactions discourages short term. By sticks in the wheels of the machine to stabbing, she makes
capital markets more efficient.

161.

We support the introduction of a Financial Transaction Tax at the European and later
also at the global level, and use the proceeds being to Belgium
assigned to lower taxes on labor here.

That stock options as remuneration packages for company executives danger with them is known.
The Belgian system is unique in that stock options are not the actual profit, but a fictional
value is taxed. Not only does this lead to a sensitive low tax, but it encourages CEOs
57

Also in the short term to inflate the value of the underlying share at the expense of a
long-term strategy.

162.

We normalize the regime of stock options held by them in personal income
to tax fair value.

Increasingly, individuals (including municipal taxes) circumvented
creation of a company without that in fact there is the exercise of a
business activity. According to a recent study by the European Commission approximately one
fifth of the income of the corporation resulting from such
vervennootschappelijking.

163.

Apparent Companies we are fiscally transparent so personal
weather becomes applicable.

Tax cooperation, internationally and in Europe
In a highly globalized world, an equitable tax system is inevitably depend on the
international environment. Unlike the economy, the tax rules are not globalized.
Countries traditionally strong hold on to their fiscal sovereignty and have often tempted
destructive tax competition. Nationalism, in practice especially multinational
to favor corporations and the wealthiest.
Tax havens were long equitable tax treatment of
capital income in the way. The untapped potential is enormous. A recent study indicates
that about 8 percent of global assets are located in tax havens,
Most no apparent owner.
Multinational companies manage to exploit their national exception regimes
own tax rate to keep small. They succeed more easily in attracting investment,
at the expense of small businesses that have less access to such escape routes.
And under the influence of the crisis countries in Europe even with discriminatory tax regimes favor
compete to attract wealthy. Denmark gives long temporary discounts
personal income taxes for rich foreigners. Research has shown that the major part of the
individuals who enjoy this but remain for the duration of the exemption, but little profit
long-term for the Danish economy.
The tolerance was such fiscal abuse in public opinion has never been so low. On
international level are starting to move things that seemed inconceivable. The OECD is
abandoned its cautious approach to tax havens and now sets a multilateral
approach with automatic exchange of data.
The European Commission proposes extending the savings directive and proposals ready for a
common tax base for corporate income tax.
58

We want to leverage this momentum, taking a constructive approach and work fully with you on
international forums that states the role thrust upon them as 'fiscal market player' re looking at
the benefit of tax cooperation.

164.

'Unitary Taxation', where profits are taxed where they are made, must
the international norm in the company taxation. We support
European proposals for a common tax base and seek
a minimum corporate tax rate. The deduction for definitively taxed
income (FDI) should be replaced by a credit system.

165.

An automatic exchange of capital income should
international norm in the capital tax. We support
multilateral approach of OECD and G20 and urge a rapid expansion
of the Savings Directive toward dividends, life insurance and trusts.

166.

We want a ban on discriminatory preferential tax regimes by Member States
the EU in relation to non-residents.

167.

Staff linked to international institutions by
the tax authorities are not taxed on their income. We want them a solidarity contribution
pay to Belgium and the regions. These people also enjoy
infrastructure and services provided by the authorities. Furthermore wear
their relatively higher incomes also contribute to low prices and a tight
housing market, especially in Brussels and the outskirts of Brussels. This solidarity contribution can
include investment in housing policy.

168.

We replace the unanimity rule in the Council of Ministers for fiscal affairs
by QMV.

Restoring confidence
Fraud is a hidden tax: the most unjust of all. Who are correct contribution
pay runs for the fraud of others. Fraud is distorting the market and distort competition.
Because fraud prevention remains a priority support for the fight against fraud
protected. The impression that whoever has enough money to somehow always escapes the dance, is
frustrating and puts people to take itself no longer so closely with compliance
rules.
In the field of anti-fraud we are switched to a higher gear as compared to the
last decade, with the socialists as a driving force. We need support for
Fraud carefully keep alive. Some may find that combating fraud now goes too far.
The perception is alive to escape the big fraudsters, while home, garden and kitchen without fraud
pardon is tackled. Support for repair fraud prevention is crucial.
We get rid of the mistrust between the tax authorities and the taxpayer by a distinction
to distinguish between the better observance of the rules and the fight against fraud. The repressive approach
59

should be limited to really big fraudsters, but fortunately a small group. Attitude of the
tax in respect of all other households and companies must be based on trust.
The example of Denmark shows that this is possible: a relatively high overall tax burden
goes along with confidence in and satisfaction with the public sector, including tax
administration.
To restore confidence in the tax administration is a fair distribution of chances
on control is very important. This condition depends on the efficiency of the administration. Our
final objective is that the (central) selection of the records check will be based on
risk analysis, the probability of checks is determined by the risk of non-compliance
taxpayer. The higher the risk, the higher the chance of control.
For households and companies to which the declaration may be completely by the tax authorities
filled does not actually control to be more. We do therefore not only profiles of
persons and companies for whom the risk of fraud is high, but equally profiles
a very low risk. We have to check where there are problems, and who is okay let alone.
The focus of the fight against fraud is very clear in addressing the large, organized
fraud. And more than ever, this approach are situated on the premises. Work is carried out by
the creation of multidisciplinary research teams at the Federal Judicial Police, which
specialized police officers and officials from the tax authorities will structurally
cooperate. Those research teams get a single framework, to ensure sufficient
to ensure continuity and research, and in order to increase the stability of the teams.
Researchers in the fight against major organized fraud have the space and resources
get to spend the large, complex projects to a successful conclusion. That is a matter of
better organization, but also more resources to include Justice.
Such investment is more than justified, because they pay for themselves. We can each
year to use part of the proceeds from fraud prevention to the contributions on labor
decrease. So we reward the workers and the companies that do play by the rules.

169.

We focus the repressive approach of the tax authorities in major fraudsters. The
relationship with other taxpayers must be based on trust,
but does not relieve them of control and possible sanctions.

170.

By improving the flow of information between taxpayers and tax authorities
we limit checks to those segments where the risk is greatest.

2.3 Sustainable growth through innovation
The environment, our economy, our mobility, our health, our quality of life. They love you all
busy day. Sp.a need for government, universities and our best companies from these challenges
laying awake. They must use our best researchers to look for real solutions, and
60

create real jobs in new or innovative businesses. A strong government that opts
Innovation and new, sustainable solutions to social needs and social
challenges is crucial. Especially today uncertainty businesses deters strong
invest in innovation.
Our innovation policy should focus entirely on your needs. Innovation must be driven by our
needs, not only by what technologically possible. To make this possible we need
competitive model complete with a model of collaboration. We go beyond the traditional
cooperation between companies, knowledge institutes and government. sp.a embraces the expertise of
civil society and the creativity of people. There are many valuable ideas contained in
associations, schools and neighborhoods. Invent a revolutionary drug to cure cancer
innovation, but a system of respite care to relieve caregivers is equally good. Just
such as sustainable renovation of old furniture or experiments to the work-life balance for
facilitate.
Small businesses provide the ability to innovate
The transformation of our economy can never succeed without our small businesses. Although
Flanders performs very well in knowledge production, putting too few companies to be effective in
innovation. We have many more SMEs need to be innovative. Innovation policy has
role models, shiners which set new standards and push boundaries. But family
companies, traders and potential growers who need that extra push, with determination
our economy tomorrow. Also, it becomes a challenge for them to adapt to a
rapidly changing society and economy. Therefore, we need an economic policy
each company strengthens and does innovate, sustain and grow.

171.

Not structures, but innovate people. sp.a encourages small businesses to more
to invest more in research. First, we simplify
application procedures and make more funds available for 'Baekeland mandates.
These are business-focused doctoral students who bring excellence in businesses.
We introduce Baekeland mandates with a social purpose, so that
Nonprofits have that benefit. Secondly, we advocate
innovation workers for each company. They sign accompanied by a
knowledge innovation a customized plan and enjoy the same tax
benefits as other researchers. Finally, we improve the flow of knowledge
between universities and the business world. We do this by companies much more closely
to engage in innovation and practical scientific
Research students from the Bachelor.

172.

We put in new forms of work organization and social innovation at the
workplace, resulting in an operating better, people get the chance to
longer work with enthusiasm, and work and family life is better to combine. New
organization, as set your own schedule, time and location independent
work and self-organizing teams should find a wide entrance. As
employee, you are no longer an extension of the machine. You will work
which you can be proud of. Work where you can find in your craftsmanship. Every
61

of us has the opportunity to contribute. Unions are
invited to carry this movement of 'employee driven innovation'.
173.

Public procurement draw with explicit sustainability criteria in full the
map of innovation and social and ecological sustainability. On top of giving
all governments lead by example. By - for example - electric
service vehicles put into use and invest in public
charging stations, also give governments a direct boost to innovation
producers. Facilitating access rules and procedures get smaller
firms more likely. Boarding the instrument 'Innovative Procurement "
intended to allow the government and companies work more closely on innovation
in services and social challenges, we drastically simplify
and we implement on a large scale.

174.

In all international innovation leaders - the Nordic countries, the US as well
Germany - the government is investing heavily in innovation and without hesitation. By
invest where others do not, in the early and very risky seed stage
innovative start-ups, an enterprising government makes the difference. spa
calls for a renewed Participation Company Flanders (PMV). That must
rationalizing the fragmented supply and resolutely innovative
start-ups and SMEs. PMV focuses on six innovation hubs in the
concept paper Innovation Centre Flanders (transformation through innovation, eco-innovation, green energy, healthcare innovation, sustainable mobility and logistics, social
innovation). PMV uses the profits it booked in the successful breakthroughs
integral to offset the inevitable losses of failed projects and
(re) invest in future innovation.

175.

The Agency for Innovation (formerly IWT) is thoroughly updated to
meet a broader mission: social value through innovation
stimulation. This goes far beyond the creation of jobs: thus a social innovation
project to respond to social needs such as improving the
urban air quality, combating loneliness in elderly or prematurely
school. The Agency for Innovation is customer-friendly,
strong communication skills, proactive and tailored to companies with large
social added value, in particular SMEs. Accompanies the
these actors much more intensive and follows for a longer period
economic and social value of projects.

An ambitious research, innovation and industrial policy
A forward-looking government has set out an ambitious and targeted investments
innovation and industrial policy. We give all support to those innovative companies that are fully up to
future (want to) work. Just because a company that is truly concerned with the future, in which
future still have a place. Technological breakthroughs are still necessary, but insufficient
not to respond to social issues such as safety, aging,
climate change or energy supply. Innovation must be the central focus and the engine

62

social progress, and supported by the community. More than just an economic
instrument, innovation should be a lever for our wellbeing and that of future generations.
A strong, smart government focuses on ideas that offer sustainable solutions. Us
collaboration model ensures that what was tested and developed are also much more likely to
by the government and the companies to be picked up. Above all, we increase the chances
user picks up the end product.

176.

Investing in innovation means choosing a secure future. The increase
budgets for innovation, science, research and development (R & D)
all relevant authorities for sp.a is an absolute priority. By 2019
we realize the European standards for investments in research and
development (especially one percent of the Gross Regional Product by
public sector, 2 percent by private players) and a place in the top five
strongest regions by increasing the absolute spending stelstel moderate. Just so
we lay the foundation for adequate and sustainable employment
higher innovation requirements from 2024. With this budget, we are strengthening our
universities and research institutions (see below) and we embed innovation yet
more in the business world and within the government. For non-directed,
groundbreaking basic research, we reserve at least 45 percent of the
budget for research and development.

177.

At the mid-term review of the European multiannual budget we put more
on innovation. Within the European Horizon 2020 program on research and
innovation and the Cohesion Fund, less prosperous countries of the European
Union economic support, we organize "twinning exchange
and networking initiatives so strong and weaker regions to work closely
to narrow the innovation gap. Structural Funds are also used
if stimulus funds for innovation, for building knowledge infrastructures
and European objectives of sustainable growth and employment
achieve.

178.

In its industrial policy the government makes sharp-sighted choices
based on the strengths of Flanders. We hesitate not cover them if necessary
to step outside the current working frameworks and tools. Forward-looking
innovation hubs - eco, energy, organizational and care innovation to
sustainable mobility - bring all the players together: large and small businesses,
research institutions, civil society, education and government. For example, we want the
metallurgy better opportunities in the recycling economy by investing
in urban mining or urban waste reuse innovative, then bring the government
all stakeholders together, including targeted research and
specific training. In Europe, we are investing more in knowledge and
Innovation Communities same purpose. Together with the government to find all
actors together in new, future-oriented markets.

63

Strengthen our universities and researchers
Scientific research is one of the key building blocks of our future prosperity.
It is fundamental to excellence in higher education, for all forms of innovation and
social progress. On top of investing in fundamental research damn
duty of every self-respecting knowledge society. Invests From this vision Ingrid Lieten all
years full of basic and non-oriented research, while Pascal Smet, the core funding for
higher education significantly opschroefde. That does not mean that we must invest much more
in scientific research and in our universities. The successful wave of democratization leads to
increasing student numbers, but funding remains. That puts pressure on key
universities and academic independence of economics and politics. A substantial
increasing the basic funding of higher education is absolutely necessary. Just so
we guarantee quality education to our best researchers and professors.
Simultaneously, the rock-hard (international) competition between researchers and universities are
more pressure on the scientific landscape. Knowledge is power, but the applied
measuring systems do not always reward the best behavior. The balance between research, education and
service is under pressure. Quick and many publish sliding into weakened peer review, sloppy
science and in rare cases of fraud. The career of young researchers, both within and outside the
university, still requires a lot more attention. Without the core of the financing decree
touch, Flanders must make adjustments where necessary to play a full international leadership.

179.

First-class scientific research and excellence in higher education
reinforce each other. To safeguard the quality of both, sp.a increases again
the basic funding of higher education structural. For example, the ratio should
between academic staff and student numbers again among the best in
Europe belong, and we provide the best framework for quality
research and education.

180.

Find answers to major societal challenges is not only the
responsibility of the government or the business world. In all domains
our scientists have yet more social
taking responsibility in terms of social needs. During the next
Legislatures we organize an open dialogue between university, government and
business world. Only as we outline guidelines for a reorganization of the
scientific research in relation to major societal challenges
(as requested in the Lund Declaration).

181.

There are more and more young researchers, doctoral students and doctors. They offer our
knowledge society a tremendous value. Nevertheless, they may still be better
preparing for a post-graduate career by making more use of
the extensive training offered by the doctoral schools. This requires a
mentality change among researchers, developers and the business world. So
we empower developers and research by the later career
doctoral students (for example, 5 to 10 years after the doctorate) to count in the
evaluation of professors and universities. Doctoral we encourage explicitly
64

look out the academic walls. We want to give them an internship of one to three
months offer a non-university employers.
182.

The gender balance in academia is truly dramatic. A
female preponderance among students and doctoral stores plummeting into ever
fewer women higher you look in the academic ladder. Unbalanced

gender stereotyping and 'implicit bias (unconscious attitudes). sp.a believes in

fair rules and agreements on maternity or parental leave an
required; a strict monitoring of the inter-university charter Gender Equality
and the university's policy on gender is necessary.

Continue to invest in basic research
183.

The Fund for Scientific Research (FWO) remains a key player in the
Flemish science policy. We strengthen its role as independent
funding of basic research. Both by independent,
partly foreign board members in an active Board of Directors
to give a greater say in strategic decisions. The other by
expert panels effectively letting determine which projects and mandates
be financed. To scale and exchange of expertise
promotion, the FWO has to structurally cooperate with its Walloon (FNRS-FRS)
and Dutch (NWO) counterparts.

184.

For many years, linking the Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP) excellence,
scientific autonomy and continuity of an explicit focus on
cooperation in the basic, non-targeted research. In the transfer
this power to the Communities since 2017, Socialist Party wants the mission and
This instrument continue unabated, and even stronger commitment
National and international co-managed by FWO and FNRSFRS.

185.

The federal science policy is important and again a prominent
Recording role in international and European networks and infrastructures
science. Additionally sp.a gives the federal scientific
institutions (such as the Royal Museum) adequate resources and control in
by autonomous Scientific Guidance Councils. This needs them
allow to modernize and their rich collections through extensive digitalisation at
Serving set of society.
2.4 Investing in entrepreneurs
In Belgium, SMEs account for nearly two million jobs. During the crisis years
2007-2011 created SME net three times more new jobs than large companies, often with
65 recruitments from unemployment. They are the beating heart of our economy. Moreover, small
businesses are at the heart of society. They provide activity and involvement in
neighborhoods, villages and towns. They run more than ever on teamwork and cooperation
entrepreneur and employee.
To ensure that does not stop this beating heart, action is now needed. Small businesses
work hard and create many jobs, but face huge challenges that they are not alone
can solve. Banks keep a finger on the purse strings. Suitable and affordable staff is always
harder to find. Bureaucracy and formalism devour time and enthusiasm. The crisis makes customers
economical and as icing on the cake expire mega-shopping centers, large chains and the increasingly
increasing international competition of smaller stores and businesses. However its small
entrepreneurs and self-employed people more than ever need to create sustainable, locally based jobs.
To address these challenges to overcome, we must make full use of small businesses. Above all,
we need a policy that concrete problems of small businesses really understand and solve. It has already been
easy and especially short-sighted to promise huge but priceless as tax cuts
solution to all these challenges. Therefore advocates sp.a concrete solutions for real
problems that small business owners and self-employed people experience daily.
Act together
Every entrepreneur who wants to undertake. That is sp.a the best way to entrepreneurship
to encourage and provide growth, jobs and prosperity. But an extra effort is vital.
The number of self-employed increases in poverty year after year and is the number of female entrepreneurs
deteriorating. Migrants found in Belgium, particularly in Flanders still difficult road to
entrepreneurship. The creative industry is an insufficient focus of our economy.
Everyone entrepreneur, which is crying out for new ways of doing business and better armed
entrepreneurs, and it requires a government that deliberately bet on the untapped economic
potential of these target groups.
A company to churn and lead requires a lot more than often thought. The
requires a lot of courage and skill to make the right strategic decisions, a high-profile
marketing plan to draw from and to correctly assess the many risks. It requires a lot of effort and
work ethic to bring late night, after a long working day, accounting and administration in order.
Fortunately, you can learn many of these skills through training and guidance for start
to the transfer. And fortunately you can do a lot together, and act together.
sp.a opts for a partnership model, also for entrepreneurs. Very concretely means
that self-employed or entrepreneurs not only sharing a bookkeeper or office space,
but also in the group requesting credit. Business together can be a huge asset for our
economy, including and especially for those who appear at the start less.
186.
Young entrepreneurs get the best growth, often because they dare risk more
to take. sp.a invests in you as a young entrepreneur and provides a safety net and
resit if your plan or project still failed. Cooperative basic accommodations
for young entrepreneurs, both at universities and outside the
66 higher education institutions, providing free or cheap infrastructure (such as office and
meeting rooms, digital (marketing) support and coaching or
sponsorship effect), but also financial support in the form of a
guaranteed initial investment and a basic income.
187.
Today you can only start a business with a business management certificate
pocket. This includes entrepreneurial students without economic training
against to start their own business. We want the Ghent example wider
roll: here the students may not yet an own business management certificate
startup company on condition that they bring it within three years, they
intensive be accompanied by a coach, and not threatened their academic progress
becomes. So we encourage higher education institutions to invest in solid
coaching programs. In addition puts an equal social status the bar
equally between employees and student-student entrepreneurs.
188.
sp.a want better odds on projects such as NFTE (Network For Training
Entrepreneurship) where opportunity teenagers ABC of entrepreneurship
learn and where they are conducting projects from their own experience and interest
in a protected and guided environment. They function not only as
alternative training but give young people the necessary confidence,
stimulate creativity and offer them the prospect of a better future.
189.
To find various reasons ethnocultural minorities, difficult access
to capital, networks and relevant government initiatives. It is the task of all
authorities to take concrete measures, understandable and accessible
for all (potential) entrepreneurs. In addition, mixed networks may be of
entrepreneurs receive an advisory and peters for newcomers and
disadvantaged, not least around finance and regulation.
190.
Business together many forms: parts of machines, training
workers organize together to share accountants or
office space. As an entrepreneur you are also benefits from the merger purchases
energy. Business together is a priority for sp.a. Companies learn from
together, they work better together and there is room for specialization. Flexible
rules and a concerned government provide initiatives together undertake all
space.
Fair and livable work, even for entrepreneurs
A stronger social status ensures fair and livable work. Just as you can when your entrepreneur
combine work and family life or overcome temporary difficulties. Greater social
protection, higher pension and disability benefit give entrepreneurs more
freedom to take risks and invest.
191.
As an entrepreneur, you are entitled to work liveable and workable life. sp.a wants
more accessible child care, a replacement income in case of illness and better
worked out, smoother and cheaper system of replacing entrepreneurs. So
67 you are self-employed better equipped to work with your family life
combine. The initiative for such measures comes from both mutual
collaboration between entrepreneurs and the government.
192.
The injustices and differences disappear among the statutes. sp.a wants
equal social protection for all, provided a similar effort
regarding social security contributions. For example, a higher guaranteed pension more
freedom to take risks and invest in your company. The same applies
fair incapacity benefit, eg due to illness, from the
first day.
From bold bankruptcy prevention to a real second chance
Yet it goes wrong, then society has much to gain if they invest in a second or
third chance. Entrepreneurs who start again, are often more successful. And besides: the more new
businesses, the more jobs. That's why we can not afford to entrepreneurs
After one failed adventure depreciate.
193.
More and more entrepreneurs ends have not tied together. spa
acts decisively against poverty by the self-employed
insurance against failure to expand and invest more in
bankruptcy prevention (eg Screening4You). Upon the cessation of
your case you will be entitled to a termination fee equivalent to a
unemployment benefit.
194.
We need an overarching body, in the form of one-stop shop, where
faillissementspreventie- and counseling organizations are represented.
Within this body, all players involved have a voice (trade unions, VDAB,
banks, consumer associations, ...). The development of an accessible
plan around bankruptcy prevention is very important.
195.

the year and on par to venture a second or third chance. A
awareness campaign and specialized coaching after failure by
entrepreneurs themselves are important tools that have proven their efficiency
have.

68 Advice, guidance and coaching to build your business
197.
Starting up a company goes beyond funding. The agency
Entrepreneurship should still offer more accessible guidance and advice, especially in
disadvantaged groups. Keeping checks and business checks put starters
to better inform themselves through affordable recognized professional advice when
starting a business. sp.a reinforces successful projects starters
accompany such BRYO or Business Angels.
198.
Internationalization and innovation go hand in hand. In addition to administrative
simplification and transparency of information about foreign channels
regulations, the government concentrates its efforts on fast growers
export mature SMEs and internationally active companies. An extended
screening of SMEs leading to support and advice in the long term. The
Government offers not only individual strategic consulting, trade information and
training but also encourages cooperation between small and large
companies.
199.
A successful business transfer requires a lot of preparation and guidance. Which
often beyond the reach of small independents. Alternatively targeting aspiring entrepreneurs too little on the acquisition and conversion of an existing
company. Awareness-raising campaigns for potential buyers and sellers,
transparent acquisition market supported by transparent banking and
simpler rules respond to the aging population and the rapid career progression
among entrepreneurs.
2.5 out of entrepreneurship makes a difference
The current economic model since the financial and economic crisis worldwide in doubt
drawn. This development creates opportunities for sustainable alternatives. One of those alternatives is the
cooperative. Grab from a specific objective such as quality, price or accessibility
Cooperatives social problems together.
Cooperatives are back never really left. They respond to changing societal
trends such as the growing environmental awareness, the combination of housing with care or rising
demand for local and genuine products. They go on a social and green way to work and
combine participation with efficiency.
Both federal and Flemish Socialist Party has succeeded the idea of ​​cooperative entrepreneurship palpable
make. We are actively committed to the promotion and support of cooperative entrepreneurship.
The National Council for Co-operation was a reflection of the sectors where co-operative
entrepreneurship is represented. In the next legislature it comes to these efforts
to be amplified.
Cooperatives help you build a sustainable economy that wealth entails that
operates efficiently and that society regains grip. The cooperative is a
69 full partner in the economy. Cooperatives should be given the opportunities they deserve. A
solid legal framework recognizes cooperatives, defines their role, validates their social
added value, and provides the necessary support.
A full legal framework for the cooperative
Under current legislation, a cooperative is a corporate entity with a
variable number of members and a variable capital. Nowhere is talk of cooperative
principles. The current legal structure is very attractive for those who do not lie awake at this
principles. At this time we overcome this gap by a recognition of the National Council for the
Cooperative for the 'real' cooperatives. But sp.a here makes abolish it and create a full-fledged
legal framework for co-operation - only then that can be a lever for other economic
order.
To do that, we grab back to include the so-called ICA principles. Which offer
clear framework of values ​​and norms, drafted under the auspices of the International Co-operative
Alliance (ICA). Globally, they are the benchmark for cooperative entrepreneurship. These principles are:
voluntary and open membership, democratic control and economic participation, autonomy and
independence, education, training and information, cooperation among cooperatives
and concern for the community.
200.
The next government continues to work on a coherent legal framework for
cooperative societies. The current regulatory framework is inadequate
to ensure the cooperative identity and its ethical standards. The
bill filed by PS and sp.a in October 2013 is the guiding principle. At once
flanking measures must accompany and cooperative enterprises
follow. sp.a foresees a transitional period of two years.
Co-operative enterprise, a full competence
Cooperative entrepreneurship is today mentioned in the same breath as social economy. Nevertheless, it is a
fully-fledged form of business that fits in every sector. It is high time for a different view
these mature enterprise form.
201.
Because of their great value and the need for a coordinated policy must
cooperative entrepreneurship to become a fully-fledged ministerial authority
the Minister of Economy.
202.
With Cooperative Economy sp.a expands as full minister portfolio

Due to
specific
financing instruments we make the further development of cooperative
niches as possible. We pay special attention to the opportunities for
among other cooperative initiatives in renewable energy, collective
mobility, welfare, child care, housing etc. sp.a also supports local co-operatives
70 in these sectors and in which towns and cities as expatriate or residents
cities, neighborhoods or villages participate as expatriate.
203.
The cooperative form of enterprise we promote by supporting scientific
research. We also encourage social innovation and research
cooperative market niches.
204.
We focus a knowledge Co-operative Entrepreneurship in Flanders. That focus
the spots on best practices, and experts and opinion makers get a stand.
We provide tools to start cooperatives and existing
cooperatives to send more strongly.
205.
Within the policy remit of the Commissioner responsible for
Enterprise and Industry a permanent working group is installed. Which
consists of the policy unit, administration and representatives of the
cooperative movement in the Member States at sectoral and intersectoral level. The
Standing Working Group addresses all relevant issues (such as access to
financing measures to support start-ups and education) on strategic and
operational level.
The cooperation in education
The cooperative is still a blind spot in our education, starter guides for entrepreneurs, and in the
legal sector. To change that allows sp.a the following:
206.
We address the gap of cooperative entrepreneurship in education.
Entrepreneurship should be an integral part of the educational project. spa
taking structurally cooperative entrepreneurship in the curricula of economy
secondary education and integrates with enterprise projects in the classroom.
207.
The expertise and knowledge of the technical aspects of cooperative entrepreneurship is
relatively limited. Therefore, we should pay attention to the proper technical
knowledge of the status of cooperative societies, as is the case
for statutes of a public limited company or bvba.
208.
Another business needs a different management. Therefore,

71 Employees Cooperatives
When workers' co owner and his employees in the administration of the relevant
company. That way, employees regain control over their work. They are no longer the
plaything of decision centers in a faraway country. They make the decisions themselves.
209.
Today, the participation of workers in cooperatives
Companies hampered by the possible consequences of this participation
the field of social law. Those workers are running the risk that they
reclassified to be independent if they are with a substantial
shares be partners. By requalification lose these employees
their rights to social security as well as their employment protection (eg.
against dismissal). sp.a this provides a structural solution: a law
enshrining the principle of working as a salaried partner for the
cooperatives that operate self-managed and recognized by the
National Council for Cooperation.
2.6 A banking model for safe savings
Six years after the onset of the financial crisis, the banking supervision to the European level
lifted and banks must meet much stricter rules. Thanks sp.a the audit was extended
for all financial players, consumers regulator (FSMA) received more
control capabilities and investors are better protected.
Late last year, the regulation was further strengthened in our country with the new bankenwet. Thanks sp.a
it is prohibited for banks to speculate for their own account with your savings, be
bonuses even more restricted and can even be recalled via a clawback
and gets you as saver overrides the money from a bank if things go wrong.
Yet we are not there yet. The international banking rules are relaxed again, in some countries
after there is still no separation of risk activities and continues to dream of a European
settlement system for failing banks with a single deposit guarantee system
final part of the banking union. The four largest banks on Wall Street are even greater now
become and remain engaged in dangerous and risky activities. They do not bring
only the US economy at risk, but also the world economy.
Unless we fundamentally change the banking model, banks have to hold more capital, and
regulators and consumers with the necessary means, one can move towards a sustainable
system. And that sustainable system ensures that savers and taxpayers the bill
more get presented. That is our priority.
Furthermore, banks have to re-do what they are supposed to do: savings in a safe and
Managing transparent manner and give oxygen to the real economy. Back to basics so.
72 Safe savings
End of March 2013 the world was again turned upside down. For the rescue of Cypriot banks
was also asked an effort saver. Not much later, the statements of Olli
Rehn and Jeroen Dijselbloem to do this more often in the future. sp.a do not let this happen. As
saver you indeed are counting on your money safe in the bank. It is our job to get there
ensure that this is so.
Thanks to the bankenwet depositors of Belgian banks get more guarantees. Trade for
own account of the bank, speculating to boost its own profits without any economic
interest is prohibited. The remaining trading is limited in size and risk. As
these limits are exceeded, one must build capital buffers for the full amount
of the excess, so that the excess can not have any impact on the savings.
In addition to the deposit guarantee of 100,000 euros we provide a privilege for savers. That is to
say that in the event of a banking crisis depositors are reimbursed first. This requires
banks hold sufficient free resources.
We also appreciated clamped down on bonuses of the executive and the directors. Can so
banks that receive government no longer enjoy the bonus. Bonuses of other banks
should be linked to long-term results, yet can only half of the fixed salary
and amounts are capped. To take the incentive to risky behavior away completely, the
bonus will be reclaimed if it transpires that too much risk was taken. This
called clawback is an important tool to discourage risky behavior.
In addition, a bank will be introduced, consisting of a recovery and resolution plan,
and the banks will comply in advance with the capital requirements under Basel III / CRD IV (notably
the Basel III standards, a comprehensive set of reform measures developed by the
international Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to the regulation, supervision and risk management
to strengthen the banking sector). In this way, the banks provide for a larger buffer and
extra safety.
210.
All savings must be safe. We therefore advocate that European
level identical measures be taken so that high-risk activities
are split off from the savings.
An international banking system with stronger buffers and a common approach when it goes wrong
The federal government has not waited for the European proposals. She has, along with
sp.a, to ensure that the taxpayers and savers are safe. European and international
level remains sp.a make a case for reforming the banking system so fundamentally
the bill from the outside no longer be presented.
For sp.a means first: build adequate buffers for all banks. The
However, international bank lobby is strong. That was proven again when the Basel Committee
capital rules eased again. This despite warnings from international experts which
even Basel III does not go far enough. Now rules are weakened on all sides. The relaxation
73 comes again under the pretext that the planned rules should economic recovery
braking.
However, the importance of adequate capital is not to be underestimated. Banks thus have a greater
pad if it goes bad. The more capital, the more banks can absorb before
They go in a hurry or need to be rescued by the taxpayer. They are also less sensitive to
economic fluctuations. Moreover, just the opposite happens of what the lobby
asserts, banks with higher capital buffer provide more credit than banks with
small buffer.
To prevent the Belgian taxpayer and the government such invoices again
dished, it is high time for a European approach to provide for when it
goes wrong. Following the European supervision is therefore high time for a European
resolution mechanism and to create European deposit guarantee system in life.
211.
One of the reasons for the recent crisis was the lack of capital. Banks
could through all kinds of accounting rules their capital at historically low levels
hold. For every 100 euros banks had only three euro capital. The
increase of capital is thus of great importance in order to make more robust banks in
the future. sp.a strives therefore to European to go beyond Basel
III / CRD IV and to increase the capital according to the risk. Systemic
big banks should, as in Switzerland, to hold additional capital. The
new rules are also much more transparent in order to prevent abuse
becomes.
212.
Now the European banking supervision is a fact we must urgently work
a European deposit guarantee system and a European resolution mechanism and
fund to effectively dismantle failing banks and not to let the cost
commissioned by the taxpayer and national governments. Again advocates sp.a
that Belgium plays a leading role.
A durable and service banking sector
Now that the financial sector has forced refocused on the Belgian market and is
concentrates on basic banking services, it is high time to move towards a sustainable
financial system where the focus is shifted for double-digit profits for good,
reliable financial services for you.
For sp.a this means supporting the real economy, investing in social projects,
offering sustainable products, releasing the shadow banking activities and harmful products
and cease activities with tax havens or tax evasion.
The first steps have now put. Through the folk loan you can choose your savings
investing in the real economy, ranging from SME financing to hospitals and schools.
We also put food speculation on tires must be made shadow banking activities known
74 are at the NBB and will assist in tax evasion punishable by the withdrawal of the
license.
After the restructuring plans, it is time to make a choice for the future. For that sp.a
sustainable banking.
213.
Financial education should pay more attention to the social
responsibility of the financial sector. That is essential in the sp.a
transition to a sustainable financial system.
214.
sp.a wants a change in mentality in financial institutions by the
for preparation of advice rather than sales. Correct and honest advice leads
namely to sell itself, and especially a sustainable customer relationship
long-term.
215.
Besides the folk loan requests sp.a banks at least one sustainable savings product
offering, where it is clear to the saver which uses its money
becomes.
216.

The moratorium on the commercialization of particularly complex
Structured products is a good tool for its signatories.
They undertake to temporarily no structured products
commercialize that do not meet the established criteria. For the non-signatories, and especially through free services, however, is all possible. The
moratorium must be binding and are used worldwide.

217.

sp.a also calls for an extension of the moratorium for all high-risk and
ethically sound products, such as speculation on raw materials
food or financing the production of controversial weapons.

218.

The care process and the banking plan that came into being following the
closure of Ford Genk and suppliers shows that the banks are also opportunities
have to take on their social role. sp.a calls
(local) banks this "social responsibility" certainly not
Words have but to proactively contact their customers
be affected by the closure or restructuring of their company, together
to find a solution for any problems they encounter in
the repayment of their loans.

219.

Thanks to the new bankenwet banks could lose their license if their
assisting clients in tax evasion. sp.a extends the line and finds that
financial sector should be fully transparent and its transactions with
Tax havens must stop, on pain of sanctions such as the withdrawal
the bank's license.

220.

sp.a advocates transparency of the banks on their shadow banking activities and
Suggests that the risks are on the same level.

75

For example, should risks at the level of monetary funds on the same
level are covered.
The financial sector is an important employer in Belgium. She gets past few years, however,
with some major challenges. On the one hand the new regulation and
restructuring plans in response to the financial crisis. On the other hand the way to
digitalization. sp.a however, insists to continue to focus on sustainable personnel
where no redundancies wherever possible and where people are reoriented
and trained.

221.

The road to digitization has begun. Counters disappear and the long
queues for simple transfers. sp.a however, asks to remain committed
on excellent customer service and human relations. Furthermore, the sector needs
responsive to the future, and its employees reorient in the context of
digitization and provide the necessary training and a decent wage so fixed
perverse incentives disappear.

Strong oversight ensures strong and sound banks
The core tasks of the European and national surveillance, basic banking and real economy
secure, as well as protecting consumers and monitoring the market. To duly forward to
feed, we need the prudential regulator and consumers, respectively NBB and the FSMA, the
provide resources they need to perform these tasks.
sp.a therefore conduct already extended to insurance and
intermediaries, as well as to all financial products and services. Consumers supervisor
(FSMA) gained more control capabilities through mystery shoppers and can now more and better
impose sanctions. If an investor has suffered loss due to an error by the provider, this could
obtain compensation. Through a label based on risk classes increases transparency
for consumers and there will be a standardized information sheet for each financial product.
To safeguard the fledgling health of the Belgian banks is that priority for sp.a
avoiding conflicts of interest and potentially harmful products from the market on time
are excluded.

222.

Besides the financial sector should also be members of the Executive Committee and the Council
Monitoring of the FSMA and the NBB regularly a full screening to
passed with oral test which assesses whether he / she is ready for the
function. Skills and experience within the financial sector are of
interest.

223.

Offices auditor should be independent and no other activities
perform to prevent conflicts of interest. The auditors must also
are chosen by the regulator and not by the financial institution
themselves and should be more strictly monitored by the regulator.
76

224.

The function of compliance officer in the bank is very important. He or she must
his / her work can do in complete independence. For that reason, wants sp.a
let the compliance officer and choose to pay by the regulator.

225.

The European code of conduct and product regulators, banking and insurance
(ESMA and EIOPA), all new financial products and services
approve, before that can come on the market. They must also
eliminate bad or risky products. Consumers supervisor
(FSMA) must be able to impose additional rules and can appeal against it
obtain from the European passport.

226.

To the responsibility of the authority to approve the prospectus
increase, a substantial portion must be (at least 30 percent) of a
structured product sold in the country of that authority. If not
the risk is simply exported.

227.

sp.a advocates a European package of sanctions for banks that no national license
but getting contaminate the land through harmful,
opaque, very risky products. This sanction package, the national
supervisor can apply.

228.

To increase transparency and uniformity sp.a advocates for introduction of
the label and the information sheet for financial products at European level.

229.

There must be transparently communicated between the ombudsman and
FSMA, including on individual cases. The FSMA can not mediate today
between you and your financial institution, and not the result of their research
inform. That should change in the future. The FSMA is indeed in
protection of the consumer.

230.

sp.a advocates an independent financial formation of the FSMA in
cooperation with civil society organizations. These training packages should
elaborate on the following questions: What does a bank and what is its impact on
the society? What can I do? What are harmful investments?
Such information must include secondary education in its curricula,
but must also subsequently be sufficiently available to the consumer.

231.

The prudential and consumer regulator (NBB and FSMA) have each two
year publish a report on the health of the banking sector. The parliament
supervisors should be able to hear about it also, if necessary, in secret session.

232.

sp.a calls for parliamentary control of the regulator, such as by
European Parliament to the European Central Bank (ECB) on the
banking supervision. Addressing professional secrecy to the national
regulators is essential.

233.

An independent body should come with supervisors,
academics, NGOs and trade unions that a progress report annually from the
financial institutions, prepares and publishes. This can help make the transition to
77

a sustainable banking sector better monitoring. The report may include
the following matters are included: investment in the real economy,
an investment policy with respect to basic labor rights, environment and
climate, reporting on activities in tax havens and speculation.
234.

There will be an independent European rating agency without interference
commercial interests in order to break the current oligopoly.

235.

In January 2013 an official savings simulator was created. It is a
good tool to compare the offer on the market. sp.a But advocates
an extension of the savings simulator. For example, it should be clearly under which
deposit guarantee system you fall in the bank, and how sustainable is the bank. On
This allows you as a consumer to make an informed choice.

Opportunities for small and durable players
Deregulation and scale of the banking sector got the wrong result. The consequences
are legion and will reverberate for a long time. The diversity of the European banking system is also
greatly reduced by the dominance of a small number of very large and complex banks.
For years, the niche players were at a disadvantage because of their prudential risk management. They came
almost undamaged from the crisis, but have to pay for the megalomania of
failed financial institutions. High time for this to change anything.

236.

Our banking system must evolve towards a diverse banking landscape. sp.a wants
therefore more opportunities for small, sustainable and cooperative banks. We advocate
for a clear framework for these banks, possibly explained by a
certificate.

237.

In imposing new rules and fees must we always take into account
with the small and durable players on the market. We have traditionally
banking reward, not punish. The contribution of banks should therefore
be calculated on the basis of their risk behavior.

238.

The current legislation is a tangle of European and national legislation. All these
small and large rules allow the start-up of new entrants almost impossible. Also
the current players get it this way difficult to get all these rules
fathom. sp.a therefore wants a revision of the Code of Financial Law,
so that the laws are better coordinated. It goes without saying that
Consumer protection is also a priority.

: 2.7 Appropriate funding for your business
From start to career or business transfer, financing a business requires hard work, courage and
vision, take risks and seize opportunities, but also collect setback. Experienced before the crisis
many small business owners struggle to find the right financing. Today is
situation worse. The contrast with scholarships that seemingly detached from everyday reality
78

again record highs have recorded, is frustrating for many start-ups, self-employed and
entrepreneurs.
Our financial system is inadequate today suited to the variety of entrepreneurs.
Large banks that are too far from the local economy in which most entrepreneurs
works dominate the bank credit. This makes credit more expensive for small businesses and cuts too much
starters off the breath. Well-intentioned government initiatives are too fragmented and so unknown and
unattainable for entrepreneurs. The massive savings stocks are hardly mobilized by
a lack of innovative alternatives.
There are the major challenges to invest in your company to lift to a higher level.
Sp.a of the answers are simple but powerful. More transparency between banks and
companies reduce the distance between banker and entrepreneur. More diversity in
financial instruments (microcredit to venture capital) brings together entrepreneurs and savers
closer together, and allows any business to choose the appropriate formula.
More transparent banking as an entrepreneur

239.

Openness and trust between your bank and you as an entrepreneur to start
clear guidelines and criteria. sp.a wants the banks in an understandable way
ratings and underlying valuation disclose. Also about
(changes in) eligibility criteria and credit conditions should they
communicate transparently. A detailed motivation in refusing to
credit application ex post adds clarity ex ante. The improvement of the
credit file is the main goal.

240.

Banks work with the entrepreneur in the best form of credit. She
pay attention to the many forms of government, especially
guarantee schemes, which are often insufficiently known now. At once
the government streamlines the proliferation of existing initiatives so
business owners quickly find their way to the right product. For their part,
nailing entrepreneurs their financial knowledge. Overdraft is the most
used, but certainly not the cheapest form of finance for small
companies. Especially subordinated loans are particularly useful for KMOfinanciering, but today are insufficiently known and used.

241.

Openness and trust only work if the entrepreneurs are engaged and
reveal. The books completely open up leads to a trusted banker to
a better flow of information, to better credit files and objective
ratings. sp.a committed to reciprocal transparency, because this leads to a better
partnership between the bank and entrepreneur. Bank details are better retrievable
and transferable, even for the government, so that entrepreneurs their funding
easier to diversify and share the necessary information with third parties (such as
service providers).

79

Alternative financing for your business
242.

Stronger together, so are business finance entrepreneurs unite
and will serve as together credit applications. This reduces information problems
because entrepreneurs so openly make your own selection. The
increase certainty for banks with cheap credit as a result. A
right legal framework for business cooperatives and credit unions
entrepreneurs make that entrepreneurs each other reliably
finance.

243.

Innovative financial products broaden access to core funding for
companies. For many entrepreneurs, especially immigrant and
women entrepreneurs who elicit harder bank credit, is the network of
friends and family a crucial initial funding. sp.a reduces risk
for financiers by guarantee schemes further drawing out customized
young starters, and funding for start-ups, such as
microcredits, to anchor better legal.

244.

For many entrepreneurs, crowdfunding is a particularly useful investment vehicle
for its users, but keeps it indeed a significant risk. spa
therefore calls for a revision of the legislation on crowdfunding. We want
both an easing of barriers to the prospectus requirement and the other
a very clear publication of the risk both on the website of the FSMA
on the website of the questioner. The risk must be clear from the outset on the
interested parties.

245.

European economic policy must pair the needs of small businesses
the creation of sustainable employment and the greening of our economy.
Through the European Investment Bank, we provide expanded Euro Loans
SME stated objective of more quality jobs.

2.8 A government on the side of entrepreneurs
Many entrepreneurs believe that the government gives back too little for what they take. A hopeless
complex tax system, a few accessible services or the same forms
endless need to be filled in again, these are just a few examples. Allows not
alone. For sp.a is a government that is subservient and not in a positive way
makes a difference, no good government. Cumbersome and unnecessary procedures and substandard
Services undermine the credibility of what the government is doing.
A service-oriented government makes the difference. By solving administrative problems themselves. By
enables automated tax returns, which often skyrocketing administrative costs
from the tax reduces to zero. By data that is already listed in a dozen databases
stand to put together and so to fill out forms themselves. By proactively these huge stocks
to question information and investigate fraud and so on much more quickly identify and better target

80

check. This frees honest entrepreneurs of unnecessary controls and inspections and increases
risk of being caught for profiteers. This gives everyone more time and space to do business.
A transparent government
246.

In a free society declaration companies provide full access to the taxman
their books. The tax authorities thereby make a proposal assessment and approval of the
which company gets the assurance that that attack later is not disputed.
Prior to such an approach is a tax simplification and
reinforcement of companies required, with a much smaller
administrative burden as a result. So is more than ever the focus of enforcement
part where non-compliance is greatest.

247.

Thanks to a radically simplified enterprise tax for local governments
entrepreneurs know where they stand. We procure the opaque
Local business taxes off and replaced by more unequivocal local
business taxes that encourage more sustainable business (eg. tax
of vacancy).

248.

Targeted government support for companies is valuable, but not all
instrument reaches its goal. We submit all supporting measures
the Flemish government to thorough checks and transparent assessment. As
some programs do not produce the desired result books, for example when
our SMEs get enough support, we put these measures stop. The
up money we use all of those tax cuts. That is
cooperation federalism in practice.

A customer-friendly government

249.

The government is sp.a friendly, protects your family and your company
the administrative tangle and solve administrative problems. A more effective
Using intersection databases avoids repeatedly querying
data that is known by the different authorities. A one-stop shop policy and
transparent e-governance lighten burdens and reduce costs. In this way
reduces the real government spending.

250.

sp.a will grant social rights or benefits faster and automatically. We
wear customer service of paramount importance, and in collaboration with the
Social organizations such as payment institutions and allowances
we develop the institutions of social security to a single contact for
all questions, comments and requests of families and entrepreneurs.

251.

Thanks to a further simplification and harmonization of reporting requirements
in the Social Security, and other settings sp.a for targeted social inspections. So
We fight a lot more targeted against unfair competition.

252.

With digital licensing procedures the government speaks with one voice and deliver
advisory administrations one integrated and binding advice.

the

A customer-friendly government gives exporting entrepreneurs a boost
by simplifying all necessary documents and procedures and cheaper
make. sp.a wants the Chambers of Commerce provide a sound legal framework,
to more clearly regulate the carrying of goods. Discrimination also
between members and non-members of the Chamber of Commerce should disappear.

A regulatory authority
254.

By paying attention to the rights and aspirations of the stakeholders,
such as customers, employees, users' associations and other relevant
involved, a listed company, an integrated policy
conduct that brings qualitative parameters into account. Currently must
relevant interest groups acquire a share at the fair
speak available at the Annual General Meeting
shareholders. sp.a wants boards of directors to the relevant interest
thus appoint and give the right to speak at that meeting, without being
must be a shareholder.

255.

Members received from the board of directors of listed companies
preferably no race-related pay. After all, they have the role to the
interests of the company to be monitored in the long term. Fortunately,
business world itself asking for the implementation of this principle, the
is indeed a long time in the Corporate Governance Code. However, these
listed companies can get beyond this principle as they are very
easily explain why they did not apply it. And often this is an explanation
meaningless legal-technical masterpiece. sp.a will as a first step in
listed companies, independent directors, which by law
are imposed to pay more attention to staff and customers
the company no price-related pay may be granted.

A strong local retail
Small businesses, freelancers and retailers provide vibrant shopping and liveable cities
and municipalities. They are locally relevant and represent great value for neighborhood and community. To
to defuse rising pressure on local retailers, sp.a gives local governments more leeway
to perform a core strengthening policy and the emergence of large shopping malls counter.

256.

Fewer vacant shops is fundamental for liveable cities and
municipalities and a strong local retailers. With subsidies and tax benefits
for entrepreneurs with courage we fill empty shops again. We also want to
creative and passionate entrepreneurs to stimulate empty buildings a
to give new meaning, such as a workplace for young entrepreneurs. So
We give color to the neighborhood. We also give space to pop upwinkels and galleries

82

in buildings that are temporarily unoccupied. This avoids blind spots in the city and
village.
257.

The Flemish support policy for core strengthening trade must go further
the development of visions and the full map of the small business
pull. sp.a wants targeted housing benefits for independent retailers.

258.

sp.a opposes a 24 to 24 and 7 7 economy. Only large chains
may organize competitive herein. Small traders are entitled to
rest.

259.

Basic services such as cleanliness, mobility and security should be a priority
if we want the quality of life and attractiveness of the city
improve. It should also be paid to the small traders: custom
pick-up data which take account of the closing times, a functional
parking management or a Partnership Shoplifting that all actors on the same line
brings.

260.

There is a current oversupply of retail space. To the viability of our
urban centers still more to put pressure there will be a moratorium on
new large-scale shopping centers.

261.

Local retailers are having a lot of competition from emerging online retailers. sp.a is not against the development of online trading. We take care with
adapted legislation have a level playing field so that local retailers
no unfair competition from online retailers.

The government as exemplary customer
Finally, a service-oriented government exemplary customer which no invoices paid late.
She also enforces proper payment, so that small businesses no longer squeezed
are bad payers.

262.

An unfair payment behavior can seriously harm small businesses,
or even force an unnecessary bankruptcy. sp.a prevents illegal
Claiming additional (supplier or customer) credit or unfair discounts
by stronger companies, thus creating a fair payment morale.

263.

All governments play an exemplary role, aiming none
late payment.

3 GIVE YOUR FAMILY ROOM TO GROW
3.1 Introduction: Your child is central
Children are the future of our society. Therefore, their future is our priority. Children
have the right to express itself. Families have the right to their children
grow up and make quality grow. If that fails, we as
society's obligation to help children. We make a list of challenges or
necessary conditions for them and thus improve the quality of our future.
Our society is at a turning point. Familiar recipes and allowances
traditional family structures and relationships within the family are no longer sufficient
the challenges of today. New solutions, and other original responses or
additional forms of support are needed in order to strengthen the capacity of each family and
to guarantee. That is the ambition of sp.a: every child the assurance that he or she can fully
development and deployment to be a full part of society. Not inhibited by
the place of his crib, family income, family composition or cultural or ethnic
background. Every child, without discrimination or exception. Children are the future. sp.a late
no one behind.
To give to every child all possible opportunities, we invest systematically in all cases that the
Future of children define them in every stage of life, from birth. This is about the
different policy responsibilities back and requires a global approach. That's why we choose
one minister with this power. But we can not do this alone. For this we have a
warm, caring, social and needed just society. A society as we see it and
Shaping in Flanders. With a vision that goes beyond an election year, which is structural,
concretizes lasting and decisive policy proposals and the future-oriented
quality of life of each family and its members improves.
sp.a place your child in the center. Because of its importance and / or care needs to be taken as well
for any policy decision and the funding. The Convention on the Rights of the Child
General Assembly of the UN is the guiding guideline which every law, every decree
were tested. Guarantee the rights of all children, we literally. Many children and families
know their rights and do not run that way a lot of supportive measures wrong. And
with 'all children', we do not distinguish between background and family composition. Unilateral
tax benefits we hold up to the light to fair taxation and redistribution principle as
instrument to be used.

264.

sp.a increases and improves the capacity and quality of life of each child and
his family. Each child will receive a guarantee that he or she can fully develop and
develop to be a full part of society

One minister to the child. sp.a opts for a comprehensive and thorough and child

A new funding model. The needs of the child are the starting point for
policy decisions but also the funding and the calculation of allowances.
We fund the care needs: what help or support the child needs to feel

267.
Systematic and automatic allocation of rights. Many families and
Children walk through ignorance supportive measures wrong. We know
those rights automatically increased to prevent this and bureaucracy
to decrease.

Fair taxation. Unilateral tax benefits based on the household form (marriage,
legally cohabiting, reconstituted family) we hold up to the light
use fair taxation and redistribution principle and instrument.
269.
The Convention of Children's Rights as it was ratified in 1990 by
the UN is the touchstone for any minded or future law or decree.
3.2 The best education is investing in every young
If there is anything that the global crisis clearly demonstrated, it is that education is an insurance
provides against economic disaster. Investing in education is an investment that pays off.
Education can save a society. Education is the pupils and students today
to the problems and challenges of today and tomorrow to address adequately. She brings
their knowledge, competencies and skills that help them do.
sp.a will provide education as to keep us 'good' education at top international and
to meet the changing needs and expectations of the 21st century. This can be seen in the whole
society and that everyone reaps the rewards of: future generations but also you and me.
sp.a committed to education that is excellent for everyone. We want all young people a broad
provide basic education to actively and constructively participate in society, combined
with preparation for the labor market, continued study and lifelong learning.
Our education belongs to the European top, but ringing some alarm bells. International
comparative tests our students go backwards, while countries that are reforming their education better
score. If we want to maintain our leading position, we must now take action.
sp.a raises the bar for everyone. Through better orientation and a better preparation for
those who have over the crossbar. That means we preschoolers better to bring the start of the lower
education, which we children getting primary education better to the start of the secondary and
students better at the start of higher education. By allowing children and parents choose
Based on talents and interests, and not on the basis of prejudice. In addition, education must all
recognize talents to (h). Of the rigid boxes thinking we stop and let our youth-in
85 to the extent possible - grow up together so they learn from each other's talents. We do this by
the continued rollout of the reform of secondary education.
Teachers are the precondition for excellent education. We invest more in teachers and care
for good support. Motivated people from other sectors need preserving
seniority can enroll themselves and pedagogical retraining. We also motivate the best
students to choose the teaching profession. By ensuring that they not only with the
right motivation but also start with enough luggage in their backpack. They receive training
ensures that future generations get the best education. Essentially, education
top teachers.
Our educational philosophy is based on 10 principles: top teachers make the difference; payable
education for each family; well-organized education for all young people; Education brings
young people together; the school of the future; strong education and then stronger in the society;
quality and accessible higher education; a current part-time education; invest in a
learning society; education related to society and environment.
Top teachers make a difference
The teacher is the key to young people to discover their talents, interests to generate and
to develop as maximum. We have every interest in staying motivated and well trained
for people to get the class, who enjoy their profession and give modern education. In
a strong teacher policy is therefore central to the teacher. Teachers receive an excellent education and
continuous training so that they develop themselves and their experience is an added value.
270.
sp.a invests in professional development tailored to teachers. Training and
formations respond to new social and educational developments. The
development and keeping at point of competence is important during the entire
career. That is both a right and a duty for the teacher.
271.
We are working on a contemporary interpretation task. We express the teaching assignment
of teachers in one year mandate instead of hours assignment. In a
year mission we integrate lessons, training hours (especially in the beginning
of the career), Department of operation, time monitoring of students,
lesson plans, improvement work and school assignments. We investigate how the
planning and administrative burden on teachers may diminish significantly.
272.
We aim for a teacher with a sufficiently high level graduation.
So we prepare teachers better than today for the school reality
(language problems, care, diversity, deprivation, etc.). Higher qualifications
We put in at all levels in the educational process.
273.
We offer more career prospects through the career of a teacher to divide
in phases. Beginning teachers we provide adequate educational support
and sufficient employment and financial security. Teachers are paid based
of prior learning.
86 274.
We appreciate and value the expertise and experience that someone outside the
education acquired. Additional investments in the lateral entry of
new teachers is essential. A wage is associated with acquired
seniority if someone has the necessary professional and pedagogical
has competencies. We also encourage people with a job outside the
education to provide their expertise for several hours of our
youngsters.
275.
sp.a creates more possibilities for differentiation within the role of teacher.
We encourage teachers by business internships and innovative projects to set up,
by encouraging teaching in a different context. We give teachers
opportunity to retrain during their careers and become proficient. This gives
oxygen, new ideas and know-how.
276.
The reformed educational counseling services have a more important role
play in supporting the competency of the teacher.
277.
We encourage the development of a cross-network network expertise
collects in practice innovative education. The accumulated knowledge
shared in the educational field.
278.
We will focus on a diverse teaching staff which is gender balanced and more
teachers includes a non-Belgian background. A teacher policy
strives for social and cultural diversity and reflects our
society. This policy starts already during teacher training.
279.
A professional director formed to lead a school. We work
therefore different manager profiles. We secure funds for the
scholengroep to build out its professional organization. So we work
continuing the policy making capacity of schools.
Affordable education for every family
Socio-economic or cultural home situation and possible financial thresholds either in success rates
not fix education. Ethnicity should not be a brake on your talent. We need every talent.
Therefore sp.a goes against social inequality in education.
280.
We encourage schools to put on a sound cost-controlling policy.
On the one hand we reduce school costs and fringe expenses (canteen money, study monitoring, ..)
to an acceptable level and also allowed parents with financial
difficulties in order to spread over time to repay school bills.
Collaborations with, inter alia, PCSWs is in this case, is essential.
281.
We carry the maximum bill in all stages of secondary education.
Some programs cost lots of money, a maximum bill may
inequality to begin these studies partly calories. Additionally View
We also how inequality between urban - and rural schools can
decrease on the Maximum (both basic - and secondary education). At
87 rural schools is too large a proportion of the maximum to
bus, leaving less space for cultural, sporting and
educational activities.
Annually serving people who are entitled to a scholarship failure or delay in their application.
School Grants are a tool to engage in income redistribution and education for
make everyone affordable. Annually are awarded 320.000 to 330,000 school allowances.
The government has minimum, complete and exceptional allowances increased in pre-primary, primary,
secondary and higher education.
282.
sp.a goes - in times of increasing computerization - radical for a
automatic allocation of school and study. After 2015, this
automatic allocation must be fully implemented.
283.
sp.a increases the amount of the education allowance for the lowest incomes.
This makes education remains affordable for single parent families. The
reclaiming school allowances in truancy is very harmful for families
living in poverty. This measure will be replaced by additional bet on
aanklampende pathway (eg. working with welfare and
Close actors outside school).
Well-organized education for all young people
Good organization makes us excellent education and efficient for everyone. Education should not be rigid
and his log. Collaborations between schools gums organizational difficulties away.
284.
Administrative scale simplifies the practical organization
professional school boards. It reduces overhead and provides more
job security and career prospects for employees. A
motivated teacher is the first guarantee of a good education.
285.
sp.a opts for a strong formal education, including through the audience just to
strengthen, obviously while respecting the free choice of school. Cooperation
municipal, provincial and community education should be the norm.
Educational Guidance promotes the overall development of students, increases their well-being,
preventing early school leaving and creating more equal educational opportunities. She's school nearby,
action-oriented and easily accessible to students, parents and teachers.
The pupil guidance centers (CLB) are the last few years with many new
faced challenges. The changed job responsibilities requires a thorough rethinking of their
commands and operation.
286.
Some tasks CLB record today, is best done as close to the
student. Therefore schools or regions get multidisciplinary
88 teams who accompany students. In addition, ask a number of tasks, such as
school career guidance and orientation to special education, more
independence and to better network independent regional centers
recorded.
287.
For the tasks of CLB as part of preventive health care
(medical consultations) is greater alignment with wellbeing and a mains-independent
operation required. That is why we are working with local GP groups,
community health centers or others.
Education brings youths together
By working together to grow up, young people learn from each other. The reform of secondary education
brings young people together with a comprehensive first degree, domain schools and more inclusive education.
288.
sp.a will continue to roll out the reform of secondary education. We like this
realized by already discovering in primary talents and
develop a comprehensive first stage and by the abolition of the
divisions between ASO, TSO, BSO and KSO.
289.
sp.a is working on domain schools where all students who share the same interest
parts are brought together, regardless of the shape study (theoretical or practical).
Schools profiling on the basis of an area of ​​interest. If study are
clustered according to interest the relationship between different talents will
are clearly visible.
290.
A strong and good education are also shaped by participation
pupils and students. We encourage schools, colleges and universities in
organizing and supervising student and student councils and providing
opportunities to participate.
291.
We examine whether the registration decree in metropolitan context required
promotes social mix. We adapt if it appears that this is not the case and
take strong action against schools that follow hidden mechanisms of exclusion.
292.
Also, children with disabilities are entitled to the best education. Pupils
follow with a mild intellectual disability or a learning disability such as dyslexia
where possible in mainstream education. We take into account here
capacity of schools. We are strengthening special education for that
including children for whom education is not possible. In case of an
school change follows the file of the child care coordinator, to the continuation
and ensure quality of care. For deaf children, we examine the
ability to launch a pilot project on deadline for primary education
Flemish Sign Language as a language of instruction.
293.
sp.a supports education in order to allow for adjustments: expertise
from special education introduction into mainstream education,
schools give space and facilitate to develop customized projects,
89 encourage innovation in education. Also material support to schools accessible
create for students in wheelchairs is provided sufficient. We strive
to ensure that the itinerary of pupils to and from school as smooth as possible
runs, with appropriate guidance.
294.
We want inclusive education where possible. We will take into account
the capacity of schools. We advocate excellent special education
for those children for whom an inclusive process is not possible.
295.
Excellent education for children with disabilities begins with the diagnostics
educational needs of the pupil maps, instead of just the
to label medical disorder. To establish the diagnosis as simple and smooth as possible
to establish specialized centers require specific knowledge centralized
is.
296.
Flanders is the world's leading some repeaters concerns. We want
support schools in the development of alternatives. The key lies in a
good orientation, discovering talents and flexible pathways to size.
All so each student can fully realize his or her talents.
297.
We prevent students who grow up in an underprivileged family or a
language deficiency know are mistakenly referred to the
exceptional education. We do this by, inter alia homework
provided during the after-school care.
The school of the future
Contemporary education requires different school than 50 years ago. A school is the façade
of the society in which it is embedded. A school in the 21st century belongs durable, energy efficient,
to be accessible, flexible in use, and maintain. Moreover, a school
are linked to the environment and a source of inspiration. Not only for students and teachers,
but for all organizations using the premises outside school hours. We see four
major challenges for our school infrastructure.
298.
sp.a adjust the school to the education of the 21st century. The
school supports the pedagogical concept of the school, there is no
brake on and endorses the principle of wide open school. beside
We reduce the ecological footprint of a school and we make it
In addition to the energy efficient school buildings, we also have an eye for playgrounds
where children are invited and encouraged to be creative.
299.
sp.a wants to build enough schools to demographic developments boss
to stay. These investments should help to ensure that all buildings
meet the needs of modern education and innovative
possible pedagogical concepts. This requires a long-term budget.
90 300.
We use the popular loan to projects of common interest such as schools,
finance. In addition, we look for creative ways schools
build. Applying stricter watch over the total cost of the construction project.
301.
sp.a promotes a broad use of the educational infrastructure. Schools
largely financed by public funds, but too few
open and useful to the community. sp.a encourages multifunctional
building use.
302.
We advocate the establishment of an overarching Flemish Agency
public service infrastructure which we are existing agencies
integrate. This overarching agency is - in close consultation with local
governments - choices on childcare infrastructure,
schools or nursing homes. Multiple use of space is the common thread.
Specifically for school infrastructure this agency manages the buildings, and proposes
them available to all networks.
Through strong education stronger in the society
A smooth transition of young people from education into the labor market is crucial. sp.a strengthens
this transition. She creates opportunities makes young people more quickly find their way in society and
increases social mobility.
303.
Young people who choose to labor market oriented training we need to optimally
prepare for the job market. Workplace learning, including apprenticeships, is
ideal instrument for young people to experience and competence
gain. In addition to quality work experience placements at home we make placements
abroad possible.
304.
1 to 7 Flemish youth leaves the school bench without a diploma. We put in the
primarily in avoiding and reducing early school leaving. As much as possible
Students should be able to get a degree. This can be done to strengthen them and to
inspire. Both preventive (right study and comprehensive first degree) as
remedial measures (reorientation, personal counseling and follow-up).
This problem affects young people in all fields of study. We bring
opportunities for these young people identify and expand wherever possible.
Examples include part-time education, time-out projects, moving on to VDAB,
Flemish Examiners and second chance education. A separate team of experienced
Educators catch the school with appropriate theoretical and
practical training and social activities (youth club, (volunteer) work, etc.).
Entrepreneurship among young people is on the rise and that is good. From education we encourage young people to
to take initiative and to exploit their entrepreneurial talents to the full.
305.
We apply a continuous learning enterprise / entrepreneurship increased in the
developmental and learning outcomes, from basic to higher education. So is
91 there is room for initiatives that help young people better for the labor market
understand and assist them in starting up a business. We also make
space for a greater appreciation of technical professions and
shortage occupations.
sp.a remains committed to improving literacy. People need to have adequate
competences needed in the areas of literacy, numeracy and ICT in order to survive in our ever
changing knowledge society. We focus on the need to increase literacy.
Those who score well on literacy has better chances on the labor market.
306.
We are committed to increasing the literacy (reading, speaking and texts
understand), calculation and numeral skills and the use of ICT through an
oriented approach in compulsory education, second chance education and
basic education. sp.a explores the ways in which schools can quickly
respond to the current ICT trends and the material necessary for it to
purchase. Key competencies are essential to function in our
society.
307.
The mission of education does not stop at the school gates. High quality pre- and
afterschool offers additional development opportunities to children and parents. By
a meaningful interpretation with homework, sports activities, cultural
school activities, etc. we make the link between school and leisure. This
activities provide additional development opportunities to children and parents and make
the school a place where leisure activities and additional
Students support on a regular basis and accessible to get a spot.
Supporters education we connect with the school to help parents
educational questions and the correct way to refer to the guidance range. We
limit the amount of homework.
Quality, affordable and accessible higher education
sp.a gives all talents a chance. Prosperity for everyone but if everyone has access to
a diploma that fits best. Therefore, the last policy period, the staffing and supervision
students greatly improved. We encouraged the participation of specific target groups and
worked hard on international mobility for everyone.
Higher education must be accessible to anyone who has the ability to order a study
start and bring to a successful conclusion. Important are a proper study orientation, a
transparent range, a higher education that reflects the social diversity and the
further development of higher vocational education and lack of sport on the education ladder.
308.
We give institutions on the basis of intended results, resources to work
to create a better recruitment, promotion and outflow of
underrepresented groups. For sp.a the study start for a
program in higher education in secondary education. Students must
92 directed study and study so that they quickly get on the right track
sit. An orientation test will be part of this policy orientation. We
this also specifically focus on (adult) newcomers who
have intention to study further and try them through an intensive
guidance to make progress to higher education.
309.
We strengthen ties within higher education (HBO5, bachelors and
masters). We rationalize higher education through the funding system
to encourage cooperation. We work Degree (HBO5) training to become full-fledged training in cooperation with the various
centers for adult education, with expertise in Lifelong Learning and
distance learning.
The democratization of higher education is an ongoing challenge. Higher education is still
an inadequate reflection of our society. The registration fee should not be increased
be. That would mean that the most socially vulnerable youngsters forced
drop out.
310.
sp.a will not increase the registration fee. Tuition fees should not
selection means for access to higher education. Registration fees
nor may an alternative to funding from the government
substituted.
311.
For students in student accomodation, a sufficient supply of affordable student rooms available
are. Universities and colleges reaching agreements with private
providers, after checking the hygiene and safety of the offered flats. They
guarantee to the landlords under an agreement with a minimum occupancy
acceptable price.
We work with the institutions to a higher education that is excellent at global level.
312.
The organization of higher education should be transparent and focused on a
further integration. Associations of universities and colleges have a
palette offering HBO5 training on professional bachelor to master. The
expertise of universities and colleges, we must invest in clusters
courses.
313.
The autonomy coupled with accountability for higher education institutions
must guarantee a quality education. The quality assurance system,
internally and externally, is the guarantee that courses are good to excellent and the
can withstand international comparison.
314.
We encourage colleges and universities to increase their training offer
focusing on areas where they are really good at. For example by means
released after putting reducing some courses in an improved
maintain the quality of education.
93 315.
sp.a focuses on super diversity and mobility that we Flanders and Brussels
put the card. Every student who graduates must in some fashion
world have tasted not only to gather additional skills but
also to be a pointer human. Students who have financial difficulties
are supported to participate in international projects.
A current part-time art
Part-time education must pursue two objectives: (1) as much as possible
goesting people do get into art and culture by letting them taste various manifestations and
to guide them in this and (2) development of skills and knowledge of interested and
talented young people and adults.
316.
By forming broad art schools, where arts and
visual arts are gathered under one roof, we give students the opportunity
to taste and choose from a variety of art forms. We keep the
affordability of the complete training in mind.
317.
In part-time education, we make different path speeds, with
focus on deepening moments and return days.
318.
sp.a believes in networking academies as flourishing culture houses:
partnerships that create win-win for the partners involved, whether
primary or secondary schools, amateur societies or socio-cultural associations.
Investing in a learning society
Society is changing, so starting opportunities alone are not enough. Life can suddenly different requirements
set. Our agency diminishes if we do not adapt to the rapidly evolving
society. And to enable them 'initial schooling is often no longer sufficient and that creates
new inequalities at any age. Therefore we have designed a learning society in which
anyone at anytime given the necessary training and opportunities.
We show the way to people who have no qualifications secondary education to adults
have insufficient literacy skills, to foreigners to integrate
in society, older people to keep up with the latest developments. The government must
accept its responsibility, because only through public funding can anyone afford this.

319.

We put in a strong organization of accessible and approachable
adult education (second chance education, adult basic education, ...) by public
financing. This is to ensure that everyone can at a minimum cost
participate.

94

320.

We make lifelong learning less dependent on time and place by the
stimulating combination of contact and distance education. New media and
information technology increase this flexibility.

321.

Competence Acquisition through formal or informal learning we need via EVC
(Recognition of Prior Learning) and EVK (Recognition of Prior
Qualifications) appreciate and recognize. Foreigners and newcomers with previously
competences and qualifications acquired in the country of origin, we encourage
to follow an additional and / or further education.

322.

We strengthen the basic education sector so that everyone can participate up
to society. We want everyone to basic skills
has mastered.

323.

Who is new in our society must be given every opportunity to integrate.
Adult education plays an important role. In the first place
by whoever needs to learn Dutch, but also by investing in
vocational training for foreigners so that newcomers to get started quickly
can.

Education linked to society and environment
sp.a provides youth education that prepares them for the future and responds to changes in
The society. As we prepare young people for the future.

324.

Education should exploit the opportunities offered by digitization optimal. We
invest in digital learning environments and the development of adapted
materials. We pay enough attention to this during the
teacher training and investing in training for existing teachers so that
Teachers this new teaching resources can optimally
use.

325.

sp.a supports new forms of innovative practice and education
supports research into the possibilities of team teaching, immersion education,
serious gaming, internal class differentiation and open learning environments.

Space: 3.3 and support for every family
The ways in which we work and family responsibilities, varies greatly: the capacity of families
differs, as the ambitions and care needs of family members and the age of the children. There is
an increase in the number of single-parent families, blended families and female
heads of families. The traditional breadwinner model is gone. But everywhere will sound the same question
for solutions and answers to the reconciliation of work and family life possible and bearable to
make. The call for a socially just policy that is accessible to all types of families
sounds louder. More than half of the women who work part-time, this is doing to the
to combining work and family. From all the research shows that parents of young children is difficult
have to combine their job with family life, and women three years after her mother
95

were working in less challenging jobs and with a lower socioeconomic status than for
their parenting. This gives you a Matthew effect, whereby vulnerable groups such as unaccompanied
parents get particularly difficult.
sp.a want every family - whatever composition - and each family member on a feasible, affordable and
viable way find a balance between work and family. It should not be a luxury to your children
grow up. Existing services should not be a brake to reproduce.

326.

Peace Maternity and paternity leave we make even more accessible
Everyone by the amount go up to 100 percent of the capped
wages. Self-employed, we provide an increased compensation and we support them
active in the search for suitable replacement.

327.

We draw on maternity leave to 16 weeks and eight weeks for the
paternity leave. And we provide eight additional weeks, divided equally between both
partners.

328.

We give single parents the right to take two extra months. spa
promotes family-friendly jobs. Companies committed to family friendly
flexibility such as flexible working hours, part-time work, schoolbelcontracten, teleworking
and the possibility of unpaid leave during the school holidays
previously honored. The Flemish and federal government have a herein
example.

329.

The
Matthew Effect
is
eliminated
by
a
doubled
incentive for people with low incomes and single
parents and not to keep payroll in less social
benefits. We increased payments to at least one guaranteed
minimum wage.

For economical and social allowances
The transfer of the child to Flanders we use to simplify,
to make it more effective and more social. For us, every child's right; each child will also receive the same
basic amount. Whether you're an employee, self-employed, are official or not working: every child always costs
equally. We put an end to the discrimination between the different systems in the
child, like the illogical and unequal treatment between children of the same family.
For sp.a is no child second.
Children do not choose what they are cradle. Therefore we broaden and strengthen social
surcharges. We are increasing the amount of the fee and take the income ceiling at which
single-parent families are the most in advance. Furthermore, we extend the group of families who
eligible for the social supplement. Thus, a total of 65 000 additional children
Flanders right to social allowance - a total of about 20 percent of all children. In this way
we strengthen the fight against child poverty.

96

The transfer is also an opportunity to engage the child in a coherent and comprehensive
child and family policy in Flanders. This is a policy that invests in children and adolescents from the
crib, and even before, until graduation. Child benefit is a key piece of that puzzle.
Its importance we make it clear through the right to child write in Article 23 of
the Constitution.
We guarantee the correct payment in the transfer: no family will have to wait for the
payment of child support. No existing family lose a eurocent by the
reform. They win under the reform roles in the new system. Those who would lose
the same rights as today.

330.

We know every child the same basic amount of 130 euros.

331.

Because the cost of children increases as they grow older, we reserve
the age supplement.

332.

We are increasing the income ceiling for social allowance to 2,500 euros.
Parent families there will be the most up ahead. We ensure that
there is no 'verdienval' is a smooth transition when they are no longer entitled
On the charge. Moreover, we increase the social allowance and let them
increase with the number of children: 50 euros for the first child, 70 euros
a second and 90 euro for a third and beyond.

333.

The social allowance is also open to working families.

334.

For children of former partners has so far rank only charged
for the family of the part of the mother. By a child who no longer
depending on the grade we eliminate this discrimination. In the case of coouderschap the child is divided between both parents under the scheme
which was made for the children.

335.

Children with disabilities have today already entitled to a strongly increased
child benefits. This we retain full.

336.

We strive to automate the payment of child benefit.

Everyone is entitled to good childcare
Every family in need of care are entitled to a quality and affordable
shelter. sp.a led to the registration of this right in the decree childcare. The number of
children under three years increases by 2020 with an estimated 9 percent. Childcare
this means that are needed between 15,000 and 20,000 additional childcare places. Our priority is
also realizing sufficient shelters all the quality requirements
answer. Therefore, we maximize the existing potential by unnecessary rules
avoid and enhance the viability of existing initiatives.

97

337.

sp.a guarantees the right to childcare. Within three months
request, any parent who needs a childcare place a place
for his or her child. We recognize the importance of local authorities in the
Developing an adequate local childcare policy. Local governments
should be given a leading role. We therefore transfer the Flemish funds to
the local level, according to demographic and socioeconomic factors.
This allows governments to respond to specific local needs and
new places allocated according to the real needs.

338.

The implementing of the recent decree must childcare
be evaluated in order to meet real local needs.

339.

When realizing the local childcare counter plays a major role.

340.

The current trend whereby all but more and ever new rules
imposed thereby unintentionally childcare places are lost, we bow to
to a situation where we avoid red tape and
make it possible to absorb more children. The full needs
Childminding social status, which in recent years by sp.a already very
what work was performed, be finalized. That way we guarantee
sustainability of childcare places.

341.

More than half of the start-up self care initiatives within
the year. We want all childminders join a service
childminding so that they can be optimally supported and assisted. Also
the full social statute for childminders should, which in the past
years sp.a already a lot of work was done, be finalized. On that
how we contribute to both the sustainability of childcare places, as
of jobs in childcare.

342.

Single
mothers
work
often
part-time,
while
privékinderopvanginitiatieven give priority to a full-time child placed.
Childminders and nurseries who bet on flexible care we support
extra. We also provide accompanying measures for childminders or services
who bet on a thorough policy priority.

343.

Everyone is entitled to affordable childcare. We therefore make it for all
childcare initiatives that want to be in the system that
Income-related care (IKG) in steps.

344.

sp.a wants a clear quality. Education, training and formation
professionals in childcare and their succession is a separate task that the necessary
get support. Shelter Managers actively participate in
quality networks so that knowledge and best practices are easily shared.
Quality control must be done especially in the area itself, rather than
paper. The guidance-and oversight agencies have a quality control.

345.

The existing child care landscape there is room for new perspectives and
innovative organization. Therefore sp.a focuses on cooperative care and
98

the parent crèches and we advocate for support structures in a
pouring cooperative form.

Parenting for everyone to suit everyone
Raising children in a complex and demanding society is any easier
become. sp.a therefore wants to support children and their parents in this. This is not just about
parenting advice and a well-developed family support, but also a preventive
care and proper health care. All parents sometimes have questions or doubts about the
education of their children. Social support is often an important form of informal
parenting support. A conversation with another parent, friend or family sometimes has been offering
satisfactory answer. Sometimes there is a need for additional advice or support. Parental support
therefore no separate form of work, but is performed by several persons
Facilities such as GPs, clinics or Children's Houses: 'It takes a whole village to
raise a child. "By working together we can make a difference.

346.

sp.a defines prevention, support and supervision aimed at
preventing social exclusion instead of the avoidance of
further slippage. This means that we service from this angle
organize:
meeting houses,
family support
community work,
sports camps ... but also in places where young people gather: youth,
schools, ...

347.

We are expanding the number of Children's Homes of: integrated open and very
access centers where parents can go to with questions and upbringing
Questions about health care, employment, childcare and informal
social support. Not only in the center cities, but organized
level of care regions. We hereby also pay extra attention to the role of
the father so that they become more involved in the environment and upbringing
their children.

348.

We offer assistance to young people in places where young people gather. On
schools, youth clubs and no longer in a separate centers
have inhibiting effect. We also support initiatives online
assistance to be offered to young people.

A law tailored to your family
Even today, our family does not always contemporary answers to social
trends and issues. Just think of the situation of stepfamilies.

349.

A legal framework should the rights of the parent with the children
capture.

99

350.

In a lesbian or gay relationship must mee-mee-mom or dad
automatically recognized as a parent (by marriage through marriage; at
cohabitation by recognition).

351.

Problems of access rights must be detected quickly and efficiently
be addressed. So we are trying to prevent a child lost contact
will any of the parents.

352.

In case of joint custody, both parents must be able to enjoy the large and
small benefits to dependent children, as the discount
(school) subscriptions (which already applies Line), the rental of a social
home, but also for a Grabbelpas or library card. Today, which is equal
award unfortunately the exception. We make an inventory of all benefits
related to the domicile of children and works inequalities away. A
'co-ouderschapspas', issued by the registrar of civil status is a
quick and conclusive evidence to include all kinds of benefits.

353.

sp.a ensures that there is finally an end to the discrimination against women in the
name transfer to children. We carry the double surname in, in the
order that parents prefer.

Inheritance stems largely from the Napoleonic era and takes little account
with countless social developments. A global reform is imperative.

354.

The testator given more freedom over the succession. The legal reserve (

Children are limited to half of the estate, regardless of the number
children. The legal reserve for parents (in case of death of a child)
is abolished.

355.

To discriminate between real and personal donations to
suits, the valuation for these grants at the same time
captured, especially the date of the gift

356.

By making input in value as possible, it is avoided that goods, which
were donated, must be sold in order to divide the inheritance.

357.

We make (yard) contracts possible with all parties in concert
during their lifetime may agree on a future inheritance. So
We also tackle the specific problems in stepfamilies
to. Specific arrangements may be made for the survivors
Guests, who are in a dependent state.

358.

The tasks of the notaries are revised. Less complex tasks we carry
over to the administration. We also give notaries some technical legal tasks, which we unburden the courts. The fees of the
notaries be brought into conformity with the quality and the size

100

of the work. We strive to notaries in time to print
purchase.

A place for new family forms
With 30,000 divorces per year makes Belgium with the European leaders. The emotional and
financial implications of a divorce are underestimated for neither party,
nor the psychological impact of the 10 123 young children here on an annual basis with
to be confronted. In June 2013, the bill was to create a family court
approved. This brings all disputes within the family, except for crime, for one
judge. This reform was a well-intentioned step to loss of time, procedures and contradictory
avoiding decisions to keep records one family court. For lack sp.a
still some basic things and we want a number of possible perverse consequences
exclude. The legal status of minors and the importance of skilled young lawyers
a priority for us.
Not only by the high divorce the traditional family structure is no longer a rule
Lake. The number of gay marriages rose to 1408 in 2012, while the number of traditional marriages
annually decreases. More than one in ten children under six years old growing up today in a
parent family. After the age of six years is already one in five. The poverty risk among children
parent families is significantly higher. These are figures that require an adapted policy
families after a divorce, for stepfamilies and single parents.

359.

Everyone is entitled to the necessary family and educational time. We guarantee this
for single parents by two additional months of parental leave
features and no withholding tax on the social benefits to keep.

360.

Both unmarried singles as for singles after divorce
count the dependent children double in the calculation of the allowance.

361.

The increase in the division right from 1 percent to 2.5 percent is with
immediately cut back and the family after the division
divorce final exempt from distribution right.

362.

We give a full family discount on all social tenants after
divorce.

363.

The reduction of 34 euros in tax for unmarried
singles with children is also granted to divorced parents
are taxed as single persons.

364.

Service and operation of the Maintenance Recovery Service (SECAL)
is inadequate and needs to be completely reviewed. In addition, the located
income limit that applies to out to advance to the creditor
pay too low and the payments themselves often inadequate. We want a
more customer-oriented approach in favor of single parents and plead
101

for the transfer of the payment scheme to the CPAS. The CPAS
may be local, neighboring contact the financial needs much better
estimate and the amount of this advance a better match. We want
strive to offer better prospects for the creditor. The
Advances may today just constitute a threshold to move towards
growth opportunities through a rigid employed income.
365.

Minors are also in divorce proceedings, the right to free
legal assistance from a - preferably specialized - and youth advocate
this right shall be in writing and orally informed.

366.

During and after the divorce, the child entitled to free psychological
support with a recognized specialist or authority.

367.

sp.a goes a step further than the hearing right for minors. Minors
if necessary, can invoke a right to speak in the absence of the
parents and with the assistance of a - preferably specialized - youth advocate.

368.

Both in the first, second or third pillar is provided that, when
Divorce is always carried out a split of the future
pension rights accrued during the marriage.

3.4 Neither child should be left behind
No child should grow up in poverty
Disadvantage and unequal opportunities from generation to generation. Inequality and
Poverty begin in childhood and even in the womb. The fight against child poverty is a
absolute priority. We tackle inequality at its roots. It is our struggle to have children as soon as
possible to get out of the poverty cycle. We pay extra attention to the first three years of life,
because research shows that this period is crucial for the development of children. Invest
in children pays off for everyone, for the whole society. Every child should be given every opportunity
to develop themselves. Wasting talent is not an option.

369.

The fight against child poverty is a top priority of the next Flemish
government. She pulls before at least one percent of its total budget from additional,
specifically for the fight against child poverty. These resources are therefore in addition
resources for education child care, child and family support.

370.

One minister to the child. The transfer of the child an opportunity to
at the Flemish level in a comprehensive and thorough child and family policy
perform. We assure the continuity and by choosing this integrated approach
one minister all the powers in terms of education,
development and welfare of the child.

102

371.

Children in poverty are children of parents in poverty. In three-quarters of the
families with child poverty, the parents have a poor working environment. In almost
80 percent of the cases, at least one of the low educated parents. With our
proposals in terms of income protection and education - especially the battle
against the unqualified outflow - and work we have powerful levers
to prevent child poverty.

372.

Lone parents are more than twice as likely to be exposed
poverty. We know a tax 'marital status' for the first child
dependents, as a measure to penalize not single tax.

373.

Never before in the history layers schooling and life opportunities so close together
as now. A diploma is the lever to lift children out of poverty and to
emancipate. Therefore, we should bet on (preventive) counseling
and support for the school career of children from disadvantaged families, so
early as possible. The parents are closely involved.

374.

We extend free, no obligation trial - and homework support (school
Support ") - to house strongly with student teachers or 'buddies' and beds
in all cities and municipalities. The methodology of the Pulley (free and
voluntary home by students) that disadvantaged children and families
create more opportunities, extends here as an example. The Ghent model 'buddy at
cradle "in which students midwifery and social worker vulnerable
assist families during pregnancy and birth deserves a Flemish roll.

375.

Project models such as 'Instapje' in Genk, which is aimed at improving the
and educational development of young children in disadvantaged families, we promote
across Flanders.

376.

We are strengthening the Children's Homes. Children's Homes meet
the comprehensive concept of community family support, along with all
relevant actors and respectful of the local reality. We would like Houses
Child making the key figure for the reinforcement and support
families. This begins in the prenatal stage. sp.a ensures that special
attention is given to families living in poverty, without stigmatizing act. The
detection of local needs must have an important place and
under the patronage of preventing families and children. As we address the cause
of empty lunch boxes in schools.

377.

The fight against child poverty, we should not constrict to family support.
We always have an eye lives for the social conditions in which the family.
An anchor figure in the family support ensures that become bridges

378.

High-quality child care has the greatest positive impact on children
a family in poverty. As we know that the risk of poverty for working poor
families is very high. We generalize the income-related care (IKG) and
making the combination of work-children for everyone. We do everything
103

to disadvantaged groups, such as families living in poverty, access to childcare
do find and eliminate cultural barriers.
379.

In early childhood language development is very important to exclusion in later
age counter. We opt for a policy of Dutch language revitalization
from a positive approach to all children in child care and
nursery education.

380.

Even if parents do not have wide, have children without any condition
the right to be a child and to develop in a similar way. We
encourage children from vulnerable families to participate in sport, cropping and leisure activities. We invest in publication activities
tailored to children and adolescents without stigmatization and segregation to
work. The envelope child poverty in the means of social and cultural participation for CPAS we need to raise.

381.

We put more in on vacation participation for children in poverty with a
wide and diverse range of (children's camps, family holidays, ...). We are expanding the number
Local tour points Rap step 'further order more children the opportunity to
to give a full and self-chosen way to go on holiday.

382.

Too many children are excluded because of their social background of the
knowledge and information society. Access to the Internet, owning a
computer and multimedia are increasingly important and a basic right. We
take further initiatives to eliminate the digital divide. We expand it
social tariff for internet and make it as accessible to everyone.

383.

We continue to focus on raising awareness of (child) poverty. Too many people live
After all, to believe that poverty in Flanders' no real poverty "or that it
is a far-from-their-bed show. However it is a matter of all of us
children in poverty give it every chance.

384.

In Flanders, thousands of volunteers have been active in the fight against poverty. They
be a strong partner of the regular policy and invite a
public support.

385.

The Child Poverty Fund mobilizes actors and resources to innovative and
to support long-term projects in the fight against child poverty. The
projects with good results are then in the structural
embedded poverty reduction policies.

386.

The local anchoring of the fight against child poverty remains essential for us.
Every Flemish municipality must work towards a structured and proactive policy.
For local authorities who are experiencing a major child poverty
Flanders provides structural support. The previous legislature have
developed a methodology that allows for effective and quality
initiatives. Schools and teachers are sensitized around
problem of child poverty and how to detect it and can use it

104

deal. For this we use the Local child poverty plan and
the coordinator. All this within a local network of child poverty.
387.

We bring child poverty reduction across local networks created to close
the citizens to organize the fight against child poverty.

388.

We continue to work on a National Children's Poverty Reduction Plan that
powers of the Federal Government, Communities, Regions and Local Authorities
combines and coordinates.

When youth is child-centered
Sometimes more than parenting or foster care required or requested the parenting situation
for an immediate solution. Children and parents in this situation no or inadequate assistance
Offering unresolved because waiting lists are unacceptable. Over the last five years, there is a
increase of 15 percent children in care. Nine out of ten times it is
problematic educational situations and has one child in three under 10 years.
On child welfare has been much talk over the past decade. Was more than a decade ago at the
alarm bell drawn about the number of young people placed in care. In those ten years, that number
more than doubled. Along with waiting lists has led to 'misplaced' youngsters. The
number of young people in care remains too high in the first place because there can only rarely worked
to be a structural improvement of their problematic situation, only with temporary care and
often not sufficiently take into account the context.

389.

The child is the starting point. What support, assistance or care needs it
to develop their full potential? That is why we opt for a new approach
based on the demand for care. We go for a new financing model: we
finance the demand for care based on the needs of the child (backpack) and steps
on the integral financing of institutions that provide care. We make
of a youth law.

390.

Continuity of care, participation and contradiction are our priority. The
organization of youth care should be structured differently with much more
accountability on the premises. The bulkheads and compartmentalisation must go. On
Thus, the aid workers on the ground much more able to choose the
most appropriate assistance and care.

391.

We want one file, one life coach, one minister for the child. A
integral youth care who knows even help 2800 modules after the current reforms,
does not work. We choose a real and thorough comprehensive youth at
policy over the sectors and powers. We ensure continuity in
function of the child in the form of a life coach or counselor. We
safeguard the good relationship between counselor and child and keep
taking into account the opinion of the youngster.

105

392.

One consultant annualized costs the same as a residential place and takes
better results. Therefore, we prefer to invest in people rather than
the expansion of places. We invest in their education, in their guidance and
in the quality of their job. That way we tackle the daycare shortage.

393.

We make special youth again 'special'. We do this through the
To commemorate today's logic and invest in an expanded, accessible and
accessible ambulatory primary offering. We are resolutely on a
'Services within the wide step.

394.

There is in this matter need for knowledge, research and
generalists. These are the building blocks for a properly functioning integral
youth policy. The distribution of resources is not only underfunded,
fragmented and arbitrary. We spend 2 per cent of the total healthcare budget to
research and innovation.

395.

We ensure legal guarantees for juveniles in care and youth.
If things go wrong anyway, we are committed to community service and social tasks
utility to avoid further slippages.

Investing in foster parents
Children need a safe, stable and secure environment to adhere. When
parents this, despite support and guidance, can not offer, is sought
care within the family or surroundings. Once again this is not an option, foster care deserves
preferable to a place in an institution. Currently, Flanders has 4445 foster families which
together absorb 5046 foster children. This concern is not easy and should be valued,
facilitated and supported to make it more attractive for foster parents. Estimated
services for foster care can not be more than 1 / 3rd of answering questions to foster care.

396.

Within the foster care we provide a well-developed diagnostic
support, both before and during the placement. But also a decent
intensive supervision of foster children, foster parents and respective
parent (s) is necessary. Even if the foster place stop put.

397.

The interests of the child takes precedence at all times, including the right to parenthood.
Foster parents are often very well placed to make correct assessments.
Apart from a better legal basis for foster parents, we also want to speak
for foster parents in juvenile court.

398.

We make foster parenting that way and want to be as attractive to the
foster care meet existing demand. We draw the daily allowance for
foster parents to up, as did the number of foster care days.

399.

We want to give a status to the foster child, making it an automatic
award receives all rights related to the measures for Equal
Educational Opportunities (GOK), and with this extended minority.

106

A full-fledged juvenile criminal law
400.

sp.a fully endorses the vision and content of the text of the platform
working youth sanction law submitted in 2011. The key objectives and
operating principles of juvenile criminal law mean for us: recovery,
health promotion, responsibility, standard acknowledgment and safeguarding
the quality of social life. sp.a going for a broad social,
economic and cultural policies, aimed at a just and
health-promoting society. We fight all forms of discrimination
and social exclusion and constant attention for the rights and
needs of young people. sp.a assumes the responsibility of young people,
taking into account the situation at home and opt for constructive sanction
with the necessary legal safeguards. Deprivation of liberty only as a last resort
agent.

401.

Young people are responsible people and should have the opportunity this
To assume responsibility. We encourage them to them well
information and support. On the other hand, we also support
education officials and social agencies. They are the direct
Link to these young people.

402.

Youngsters enjoy at least the same safeguards as adults:
principles of equality, legality, proportionality and the presumption of
innocence be respected.

403.

Young people have the right to full-fledged from the first moment
police interrogation and free choice of a - preferably specialized juvenile lawyer.

404.

The subsidiarity principle is always applied: the least invasive, meaningful
sanction is the most appropriate sanction, which is of limited duration. Younger
loses his legal safeguards if not chosen alternative and for being
outpatient counseling forms.

405.

We always give priority to judicial recovery, restorative and constructive
interventions.

406.

Detention or closed reception of minors can only be a last resort
be considered, if necessary, and any other interventions are no longer
be sensible or possible. Only a judge can such a coercive measure
impose, in a clear and legal framework and a fair trial.

Decisive approach to family violence and violence against children
Family violence is a taboo to break through not only, but also effectively and consistently
approaches. We have a social duty to act together against and will not tolerate
some form of physical, sexual, psychological or economic violence. This also applies, and even more
more for children. Witnessing violence leaves are as serious than after undergoing violence. In
In 2012 there were 20 263 reports of domestic violence. A fraction of the real figures, because none yet
107

14 percent of victims of domestic violence report it to the police. Means that at this
approximately 145 776 victims - mostly women - Violence underwent that same year. Not
less than 9372 cases of child abuse were reported last year. One child in five
suffers from a form of emotional violence. One in five is a victim of sexual
abuse, one fourth of the diagnoses mentions a form of physical abuse and / or
neglect of the child. The scientific estimation is that the percentage not reported
is between 25 percent and 67 percent. sp.a wants that extra efforts are made
in terms of policy, prevention and research.

407.

Any form or complaint about violence is taken seriously. All the facts
be effectively dealt with and followed up with a criminal
has important function. Furthermore, innovative projects in the approach
of family violence, such as the Protocol of Courage or CO3, evaluated with
view of an improved approach to family violence across Flanders. The
problems which arise in this context, to the plane of the co-operation
police, the judiciary and social workers in the broad sense of the word we work
away. The formation and training of all involved - police, justice, assistance
- On this issue will be further intensified. This happens in close
working with women and / or victims' organizations and academia
world.

408.

A perverse sense of guilt, the fear of reprisals by the perpetrator and the impression
the children to abandon are often barriers to a complaint
domestic violence to file. We focus on extensive sensitization, but also
on accountability of the perpetrators. For them, we must provide accompanying
measures.

409.

Specifically for children we are committed to professional development, diagnostic
research, risk assessment, prevention, research and expertise.
Including in the field of forensic pediatrics is catching up
urgently needed. We attract resources for this purpose and focus in line with
Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries as a Chair on child abuse.

410.

Creating a right to speak with respect to a public prosecutor in the case
family violence is a good step in the right direction, but is still insufficient.
We make sure that other people in such secrecy
cases may notify the court. sp.a goes even further and requires that one in
the case of minors uses faster notification of the law.

411.

In all sectors in which they work with children and youth (child care,
education, youth, sport, youth etc.), we promote the
preventing and addressing violence, both between children and between
children and adults. Particular attention is paid to the break
taboos around preventing and addressing sexual violence. Around the
increasing resilience of children to sexual abuse, put
we are in a robust and age-appropriate sexual and relational education
from kindergarten.
108

412.

Within the limits of the right to privacy, there is a unique child file to
prevent various agencies work together and an overall picture
is impossible. The emphasis is on enabling integrated
cooperate.

413.

There is a much greater determination of the perpetrators of child abuse.
To this end, innovative projects in the approach to family violence, such as
Protocol Courage or CO3, evaluated with a view to improving
dealing with family violence across Flanders. The problems occurring in these
context set in the field of cooperation between police, judicial and
workers in the broad sense of the word we are working away.

The fight against bullying
On average, one child in five daily and bullied each year 30,000 young people on a very intense
way. Seven in 10 parents do not know that their child is being bullied. In the workplace was 14 percent
employee bullied in the past 12 months. Again, we are top of the list in Europe
We shine in the absence of policy, prevention and awareness.

414.

sp.a advocates a comprehensive bullying policy: from kindergarten to workplace taboos
break through "perpetrator interpretation" of labor law to criminal law. We also take the
prevent and deal with cyberbullying seriously.

415.

An integral bullying policies both in the school and in the workplace works with
mediation. If one wants to tackle bullying integral then this is only possible on
sustainable manner by the bully and bullied into contact with each other via
mediation. Because of this one works, to another culture where bullying
no place. It creates awareness, to the extent possible, for which the
bullied goes and works to raise awareness and change of attitude at
both. This is only achievable if one is going to work preventively and not wait until the
is completely degenerated.

416.

It should be used much more on awareness and prevention in schools,
alongside a resolute approach to bullying problems in schools. The best preventive
tackling bullying in schools is the introduction of "peer mediation" where
fellow students, who are informal leader of the group, will ensure that the
communications between the conflict involved children being restored. This is a much
efficient than a repressive and experienced by young people as patronizing
policy imposed by adults. For this purpose is a staffing and supervision
teachers need, who trained as a mediator. beside
a resolute approach to bullying problems in schools can be provided if
there is sustained severe psychological or moral damages caused by heavy
disturbed or criminal behavior. We therefore provide a legal framework and review
the possibilities within the judiciary.

4 THE AREA HAVE TO COMFORTABLE TO LIVE
4.1 Introduction: A pleasant neighborhood we make together
The quality of our environment has a major impact on our quality of life. A bad
home impoverishes the people who live there and even makes them ill. Nevertheless, buying or renting
a qualitative housing increasingly difficult. Determines the quality of our public space along the
how people live and meet together. An unsafe or unpleasant neighborhood
generates distrust, a pleasant park just confidence. We deny people opportunities
jobs are literally unreachable because companies haphazardly in the Flemish landscape appear.
We drive our energy and water bill in the amount by housing misguided schedule.
We accept more casualties if we preserve the historical choice of ribbon development
hold. And less space for water in times of climate change involves increasing
economic loss due to high precipitation.
Social challenges of size so that is facing sp.a full confidence and ambition.
Collaborating thereby makes the difference. By working more and more together as a society
we will succeed in addressing these problems. As a pleasant area to live in
make together. It requires collaboration between people, people and government together, and
of the private and public sectors.
We leave these challenges do not have to an uncontrolled free market. That would
mean that your chances of a decent home to measure, on a pleasant public space, on
adequate mobility options or in a safe environment will depend a lot on where
or who you was accidentally born. In other words, here too a growing danger
inequality. And this inequality is not only detrimental to the most vulnerable in our society,
but also affects the security of our middle class. Everyone has the fundamental right to
barrel to have his or her life, to help shape its environment. Naturally,
requires a government that is efficient and its limited resources, thoughtful effort.

4.2 The security of affordable, quality housing in a pleasant
surroundings
Many people will have experienced it all firsthand: the housing market in Flanders and
Belgium is due to the economic crisis increasingly come under pressure. First there was the
huge rise in house prices: compared to the year 2000 you will pay about 2.5 times
as much for the same dwelling, whether it is a house or an apartment. Especially young families
these camps are to start their life thus: pay off the house takes a greater
bite out of their budgets than was the case for previous generations, but that's not all. Also the
ownership that demand is increasing steadily with the banks, to enter into a loan without support
Parents and family has become a quasi-impossible task. Now it goes so far that one
asks parents to be partly co-owner of the residence of their children and as complete
deposit to stand. If we let commit the market, hang your chances of a decent home on size
111

So soon entirely on where you are born by chance, more than of your talent and effort,
to say nothing of your constitutional right to decent housing. That prospect
sp.a if we can not accept.
Rent then? For existing contracts, the rise in the price in our country
regulated, and that makes the average rent rises fortunately not as strong as the
housing prices. But many tenants in the private market can tell you how the quality of their
rented house there year after year, declining, and that it is very difficult to undertake their landlord
persuade to let carry out the necessary renovation work. Not that the latter fact the
buck may be assigned outside of course a hard core of slum landlords: the
efficiency of rented accommodation is often too low or too uncertain long-term investments
to do. Furthermore, the relative stability of rents not quite apply to new
Contracts: last year it fired the height by as much as 15 percent, partly due to the
influx of families who no longer fixed loan to get because of the banking crisis.
One bright spot in this evolution is the acceleration which pulled in motion the previous legislature in the
social housing. We are proud that we have through additional grants, the activation of local
control and accelerate procedures succeeded in the supply of social housing and
owner-occupied housing to increase, improve its quality and a growth path that is smashed
leads us to 43 000 additional apartments in 2023. At the same time be modest here: even with that
spectacular growth we will not be able to cope with the housing shortage caused by
rising inequality in our society and affordability problems are also our
affect middle class.
A social challenge of format then, but one which we as sp.a with confidence
looking forward to. From us, you will not hear that you are now alone and that you have an interest in
is for you to fold back on itself and to reduce your solidarity with others. Those voices
always go on in times of crisis and try above all the uncertainty that go to people living in
outside to conduct a perfidious economic agenda of 'divide and conquer' by. Should they
however, contain some truth, then you would for example education or
health care not pay less for the same or even better quality than your American
counterpart. Similarly, we can tackle the problems in our housing, and there are all on
advancing by just working more and better together. There, turning our proposals on the
housing policy around: create more synergy between people, between families and government, and
between the private and public sectors. This also requires a government that is efficient and its
limited resources thoughtfully bet.
We therefore push four key issues which should have as our priority:
affordability, housing security, quality and a good environment. These four elements are essential
to improve the quality of life in Flanders and to trust in our society
recover.

112

Affordable housing to size
Firstly, it must be affordable housing or returned to all. It is for sp.a
essential that work is made from a wider range of compact, modest homes
tailored to the families. There will be the next decade, 300,000 families in Flanders, and
below are single-parent families, single people, (partly) the needy and compound
families are more represented. All groups must in Flanders of tomorrow in state
to find a home within their budget and meet their needs.
The best way to rein in medium term house prices, is faster
build then recover families. All funds for housing policy to spend on rent subsidies
without creating additional dwellings on the other hand only raise prices, and the tenant does not
a whit better off. Therefore, the housing allowance is primarily a tool that we in the short term and
limited willing to work for families in the greatest housing shortage, and under strict conditions.
We propose the following measures.
In social housing:
417.

We are on track to achieve its ambition of 43,000 additional social
build rental houses and 21,000 owner-occupied homes by 2023. We love having
full effort and follow local authorities actively to fulfill their duty.
The need for budget housing will only increase in the future, so
Now is not the time to weaken the political will. More social
homes can only come if social housing
must obtain the necessary ground and space. That is only possible if too large
private housing projects subsidized housing be provided. There should be a re-
obligation to come to ensure major projects for affordable housing.

418.

To achieve these objectives, we put all possible resources. Local
governments have been given new powers in the fight against abandonment and
dilapidation, to renovate unfit or uninhabitable homes,
improve and deploy in the social housing policy, including through the social
management law. The actual use of these instruments by
Flanders encouraged and monitored. The vacancy of social housing also
is avoided when possible.

419.

Knowledge is power. The Flemish government must also support municipalities
drawing up an inventory of different types of problem homes. Certainly
smaller municipalities do not have the expertise or budget to this information
collect and so miss opportunities to expand their social housing. The
existing system of housing associations of municipalities
has demonstrated its sound, also to the administrative power in smaller municipalities
to
increase.
Therefore
worry
we

for

anchoring potential of these partnerships.
420.
We put municipalities with a low number of social housing on their
territory further under pressure to be imposed on them to catch up
113 realize. People with limited incomes of the territory by ward
them not to offer affordable housing is morally reprehensible and should not
his policy option.
421.
We make social housing more responsible for the
quality of their housing stock and ensure greater efficiency in social
housing. The review committees, which were introduced this term and the
Checking social housing companies (SHM), are given the task
questioning how the social tenants to assess their own home and actually do
to take into account this evaluation. On this basis, they give in the first
Body constructive advice to the SHM, but they also have the power
to sanction if there is unwillingness.
On the private rental market:
422.
We encourage and support social and urban rental agencies. By them
intermediate position between tenants and landlords they play a crucial role
rental policy. Firstly, they can assist the landlord in the practical
renovation and improvement of the home. They guarantee the regular payment
of the rent, so the efficiency of the landlord more confident, and therefore rent
attractive. On the other hand they have built up expertise in the succession
and support for tenants and they are a weapon in the fight against
discrimination against groups on the private housing market.
423.
People who buy a second home to rent, we support
tax, subject to compliance with a guarantee of quality and the price
within prudent limits. Lease charge is a
socially desirable form of investing. Taxation must attractive
making in relation to other forms of power. As we increase
demand in the private rental market and we improve the situation of the tenants via
the landlords. We do this approach by tax deduction for the second
house to maintain when it is of good quality and is rented
at a reasonable price. We also deal responsibly rent tax
better than other types of investments.
424.
To attract more professional partners in the private rental market, focus
we local housing companies, which bridge the gap between potential investors
on the real estate and tenants. These companies join the government,
social housing companies (SHM), the social rental (SVK's)
and
private partners,
as
real estate agencies
and
sicafis
(mutual funds), forces. Increase to tenants companies
the form of a residential window, where it is due to its specific
housing demand and easily get a rental bespoke assigned. Presupposes
that such a housing company has a wide and varied range. To this end,
they gain the ability to create themselves new supply by investors
attractive investments to offer in the private rental market. They can do that
by involving the SHM and SVK at their operation: the combined expertise
114 of the first in terms of management and maintenance of social housing and the
second in terms of tenants guidance so on a larger scale
valorized.
425.
sp.a extends the system of rental subsidies. People who have a specific time on the
waiting list to get social housing pending a rent subsidy.
Such waiting time, we have only been reduced from 5 to 4 years. We still make that
shorter. Grants are specifically targeted at the most needy, so they
Rents do not push in height. They are strict conditions
inherent to the quality of the home and the rent. The grants
however, may be no fig leaf to the structural solution, the creation
more offerings, from or adjust.
426.
Youngsters houses increasingly working together to reduce the cost of a comfortable
sharing rented accommodation. Although they share some facilities such as the living room,
they have basically no relational or financial links. The tax rules
is adjusted so that this "band of friends" has no impact on eg. the
granting social benefits, calculating taxes, and so forth. There
must be said that there is no lasting tie to abuses
occur.
For (potential) owners:
427.
We reserve the housing bonus. In the current economic climate, it is not
efficient nor equitable to increase the uncertainty of additional people by
the prospect of undermining the acquisition of a private home.
428.
We make living bonus also more social, by deduction at an average rate
of 45 percent. We support the lower and middle classes, who by
crisis hit hardest in their chance to buy their own home.
429.
We make living bonus also fairer by increasing the deduction ceiling
provide for singles and single parents. A divorced mother
children need almost as big as a house during her marriage. But
it receives only half of the benefit of a coupling, while the one with
wages should be. Injustice we put right.
430.
The housing bonus is limited in time and expires after 25 years. Extension of the
loan terms as a means to allow the families to pay more for their property
should not be encouraged tax.
431.
With an expansion of the systems of social care and secured loans
we sure starters who do not have sufficient ownership or by too
small capital for the banks are not attractive as a saver, but
earn enough to pay off a loan, their homes may wish
to realize.
115 432.
We put the gear in the construction of social and modest homes for sale
by. Each municipality remains mandatory minimum social housing to
to realize. To this end they should have the opportunity to remain private
forcing developers to set aside part of their major construction projects
for affordable housing. Taxing land is uncultivated
also mandatory for all municipalities.
433.
We facilitate new, affordable housing formulas. With regard to the social
housing policy, we encourage leasehold system. These people buy from
a lower price a house but not the land, which remains in the hands of the
community. That makes owning your own home possible for more
people with lower incomes. In addition, the community retains ownership of the
ground and it is immune to speculation on land prices. To make the system
create efficient, the community needs at the end of the period
a choice to be made: to extend the lease or redeem the property at a
reasonable price which depends on the state of the house. This motivates people
to maintain their homes and gives them more certainty at the end of
the term.
434.
We promote collective ownership and the cohabitation of different
families under one roof. By sharing one or more areas with other
families can be more compact, durable and hence more affordable housing. To this end,
we make it possible premiums as the renovation premium as a group to apply.
Moreover, we ensure that living together is not punishable by a
For example, loss of benefits. When you have someone in your home, you should
A separate number can apply for that person, as is already happening in
The home-care services. So get cohabitants no longer complex problems
the neck on taxation and social security, and allows the government to serve
a social dynamics rather than vice versa.
From home security to housing security
Secondly, we want to restore the shaken confidence that prevails in the housing market. True
previously the gold was considered the safest investment, postwar Fleming is increasingly home
to regard as a fourth pillar. And just like that time with the gold, the
real estate crisis also demonstrated the value of a property is subject to the whims of the
market. Moreover, income and health care, but also "new" demographic
risks such as divorce, make sure to own their home certainly does not guarantee a
suitable and adequate housing to all conditions.
The socialist recipe against those uncertainties is: the only real security is social security,
and solidarity with our fellow citizens and the will to support each other as risks
strike. Saving for a home for those who can, should remain an important part
play. But it is not the only tool. Wider than home security we need to
evolve socially anchored housing security. A security also increased
accessibility and dynamism of the housing encloses. To this end, we have the following
proposals.
116 For tenants and landlords:
435.
We build the central rental guarantee and stimulate it, making
landlords can insure themselves against the risk of default. This provides
greater certainty to tenants and landlords: landlords are assured of their
income while tenants not at the slightest setback at risk from their home
to be put. Moreover, the fund is an instrument in the fight against
discrimination because already prejudices associated with the solvency of
certain groups of tenants play a smaller role. A chance to which
prejudices negate gradually.
436.
We provide a centrally managed lease guarantee fund. This fund shoot families
which could not immediately cough up the full guarantee temporarily the amount
of security and propose a repayment plan for. For example, it increases
rental guarantee the accessibility of the rental market. Furthermore, it acts as
a kind of group purchase of individualized accounts. It delivers the
Society thus more efficiency that can be used for the
renovation and adaptation of rental properties.
437.
Security for the tenant also means security on rental costs. The
obligation to display prices clearly and charges at public tehuurstelling
must also be effectively controlled and sanctioned by local
control. Too often also find a place hidden discrimination by prospective tenants from disadvantaged groups to deter by verbal exaggeration of the
last picture.
438.
We offer more legal certainty to the tenant. The House Rent Act which to
Flanders is the Flemish and legislation on housing quality must
each be tuned so that tenants of a property in poor condition not
only able to dissolve the lease and de facto standing on the street, but
the landlord can legally force to bring the house in order.
439.
The government should also actively detect discrimination in the housing and
sanction. The government or the Centre for Equal Opportunities and the fight
must counter discrimination and racism targeted checks before with
organize practical tests. Prejudices against people based on ethnic
background, family composition, age, prevent workplace or orientation
the proper functioning of the rental market and must get out.
440.
Students have when renting a kot entitled to the same protection on
rents and transparent guarantee and load control as the one now
applies to the rental house that serves as primary residence. We set rules in
associated with target prices for flats.
441.
For recognized refugees is an intensive home supervision. On that
way we guarantee a smoother start in our society and we catch the
outflow from the shelter on. The rental guarantee must be for them
117 are applicable. For persons with a residence permit which must reception
abandoned, shelter must be assured. We do this by the measure of the
accelerated allocation of social housing for homeless people to put on and
strengthen.
442.
Homelessness we look first and foremost at a global thought
to implement housing policy. Affordable (social) housing for all needs
prevent people from falling through the cracks of the net. But in the short
term priority rules for social housing still need more consideration
into account the reality of homelessness. Woonvormen with housing counseling
can provide a good temporary solution. An improvement of the
(crisis) care facilities is through closer cooperation between all levels
also essential.
For owners and buyers:
443.
We promote the free insurance for guaranteed housing for people who
loan contract to buy a home. As a result, a temporary leads
unemployment or illness no longer immediately to problems with the loan or
even lost it playing the house.
444.
People who are forced to move because of a permanent change in
income or family situation, be able to find a suitable property which
adapted to their new situation. Track the creation of additional homes
We consider the needs of different income levels and family types
by a sufficient variety.
445.
People with a chronic illness, or people with physical, visual or
hearing impairment, must have access to adequate housing that they
autonomy offer. They also have a right to adjustment contributions, so be it
long as possible can stay in their own homes. We follow the purpose of such
premiums well.
446.
We reduce the transaction costs of housing, so people do not
being trapped in an unsuitable home. Registration fees are already part
portability, but the system should be simpler. We also delete the role of
the notary and let everything go through the administration, which is a considerable
is saving.
A quality house custom
Thirdly, we believe it is important that everyone has access to adequate housing. Than
it's not just about enforcing objective criteria on habitability and the fight
against dilapidation, getting a boost because Flanders is responsible for
all that concerns the quality of housing. The needs of the population are also increasing
differentiated. Thus, the elderly and dependent are not necessarily better off in an institution
118 but they can often continue living independently. That will require adaptations to the home, or
a move to a better equipped place with more supervision. Quality should therefore not be separated
are the specific needs of different target groups.
We therefore propose the following.
447.
We will launch an action plan against the poor quality and efficiency of
housing on the private rental market. The plan includes three stages. A first
stage is the sensitization of the landlords through local authorities and the social
rental agencies and through the residential inspection. They can the private, often not
malicious landlord familiarize regulations on quality, point
sketches on deficiencies in the property and the potential for renovation and
improvement. A second step consists of encouraging the landlords through
an integrated package of premiums to accommodate the housing and energy efficient too
make. These contributions are then linked to the respect of a
reasonable rent. The final step involves a resolute and consistent
sanctions in the real slum landlords who make willful abuse of
tenants in a weaker position.
448.
We aim in the medium term to a mandatory use of the
Conformity. Homes without conformity should no longer
offered on the private rental market.
449.
The rate at which social housing renovated and energy efficient
be, the past term has been severely increased. Add this gear
we continue so that 50 000 additional homes was extensively against
2020.
450.
We make it possible for more people with mental or physical disabilities
able to live independently. That socialization of care requires that
living and welfare join forces: the housing policy is responsible for the
construction and management of appropriate and affordable housing, while
welfare a good framework and provide customized care for residents.
Live in a good neighborhood
Finally, we must also think about where we live in the future. The Coming
decade we will have to accommodate 300,000 additional families. Where and how we dwellings
will implant, has major implications for the social and economic strength of our region.
We see no merit in new coercive measures, but are willing to provide support to
new, responsible homes. This will in the first place, homes are more compact for
smaller families, which are energy efficient built. But also a better concentration of homes
in centers offering social benefits: it reduces the cost of road maintenance,
lighting, traffic jams and last but not least, lives in traffic. It also prepares us better
for a new form of spatial inequality: the expulsion of lower income groups
to peripheral areas with a smaller range of public services and at work. And conversely, the
government costs less to offer its services to anyone and thus ensures the long term for
a more efficient administration. We therefore make the following suggestions.
119 451.
People who live in existing centers, we reward you with a relatively higher
Living bonus. Through their choice of housing they save the company much indeed
costs, and that we charge. With existing centers we do not mean
only the traditional towns, only partially demographic growth
absorb, but also the local centers. Residential tax is thus a
new and efficient instrument of planning.
452.
We therefore encourage the live cores. Which residential development priority
and expanded, is determined according to clear up local principles.
An important criterion here is the proximity to existing essential
services (education, childcare, healthcare, mobility), or
ease with which such facilities could be established, and the
access to employment.
453.
When planning or renovation of social housing, we look for new,
valuable experiments with class neighborhoods, which through simple and relatively
inexpensive elements as front gardens, to introduce green roofs on the experience
human dimension at the center. We are committed to the principles of socio-spatial
planning where we plan the space for the people and ensure that the
public space social relations and a healthy lifestyle (stimulus motion
and game) allows, facilitates and supports. Spatial changes should
consider the existing "social" architecture of a neighborhood, with the
a district social work has evolved over the years. For example, high-rise
Housing valuable social relationships and low-rise buildings do not necessarily have to be better.
We also ensure that the necessary social housing
the financial means available to experience on a human scale possible
to make.
454.
At the location of social housing should be catered for with
close proximity to amenities. A social area with no access to
for example. public transport, schools, hospitals and other facilities
for the needy, denying its inhabitants vital infrastructure and will
rather magnify and perpetuate inequality. The investment in existing residential areas
a prospective tenant refuse a poorly located property without penalty.
455.
The implantation of social housing in the surrounding neighborhood needs more
pondered happen. A well appointed district represents an added value for the
entire neighborhood. Then through a playground and / or park, by stabbing for weak
to provide road users or meeting places. Social cohesion and social
Control can only benefit from it.
120 4.3 The new energy paradigm: affordable electricity for everyone
Collaborating on a fair energy market
We live in times of change. The conversion of polluting energy production to new,
clean technology has been deployed and who let us not let go. Not only because of climate change
our forces, but equally because we discover a freedom regained in this way. As
society, but also as an individual. Because renewable energy is partly produced there
where people live and work creates space for more than just the big players
multinational that produce energy and / or supply. It is at such a time when cooperating
families through group purchases green electricity and gas, insulation or high efficiency glass
effectively weigh on pricing and make a difference. And so you see that consumers are more than
ever loosening of historical energy giants and the market break open. They look around the corner and
find cheaper alternatives, save energy or produce them themselves. That sp.a draws the map
100 percent renewable energy is not only motivated by a genuine concern for us
environment, but goes further. It is about the right of families to have a grip on their lives, their
environment and their energy bills.
sp.a chooses an energy affordability, security and sustainability puts centrally and
the free market in this context only sees as a means and not an end in itself. Since energy costs
strongly biased to the family budget, regained freedom can be achieved only if everyone in it
to share and they will not be there for those few who can afford it. Especially for those who only
has a limited income is a low-energy house or energy production with transparent
pricing an absolute right. And because economic damage due to climate change
affects us all, we are collectively in benefits that each of us is able to isolate its roof. The
challenge is therefore more than ever in the energy costs and the benefits of the fair
to divide.
Our outdated energy landscape requires investment. Cracks show up in our
nuclear reactors, and appears to us transport network is not able to be carried out optimally in or. The
necessary investment costs will remain the same, whether we opt for renewable energy or
simply renew the existing energy mix. Then the choice is simple. Want to bet on
energy saving and renewable energy production offers prospects for an economy in crisis.
We need new jobs, now go ancient lost. New economic growth, now the
old stagnant. The Federal Planning Bureau states that, depending on technological choices, deploy
energy saving and renewable production to 20,000 to 60,000 additional jobs realized by 2030.
The results of the conducted energy confirm this enormous potential. Between 2007 and
2011, 6200 direct and indirect jobs created in the wind energy sector and the Flemish
energy policy led in 2012 alone and 3,500 full-time jobs. Dwell on this income
put in other words, the cost into perspective and makes a virtue of necessity.
Energy-efficient living is a right for everyone
Everyone is entitled to low energy housing. Everyone should maintain equal control over
his bill and socially harmful behavior can avoid. Applications for
energy premiums rise year after year. This steadfast policy encourages families over
ever necessary in order to realize energy-saving operations. sp.a further builds on this because the
121 invoice printed through energy savings it makes us easier and cheaper
achieving climate targets. sp.a accelerates investments in insulation of a (rental) house
by making them accessible to everyone. Because of this we also realize economic growth
in the construction sector. The Flemish energy policy alone, created in 2012 3.500 full-time
jobs and the Federal Planning Bureau calculated that bet on energy saving with 25 000 additional jobs
save entail between now and 2030. Energy is an absolute win-win for all of us and the
society as a whole.
456.
sp.a advocates at European level for binding targets in terms
energy saving. Currently these are only voluntary, so the
target to save 20 percent of energy by 2020 are likely not met
becomes. sp.a will still make binding this objective and links to this one
binding target of 40 percent energy savings by 2030.
457.
sp.a find energy efficiency of buildings is essential. Our Flemish houses
are significantly older and therefore be less favorable (energy) state
then the homes in neighboring countries. sp.a know there is a great potential for
energy remains unused and makes more work from prevention through energy
good insulation and the intervention of energiesnoeiers.
458.
Your family should be simple and at the best price (rental) house isolate.
The best price / quality ratio we guarantee by distribution
the insulation demand in a particular area, and periodically let bundling
to organize group purchases for the purchase of materials and / or the
execution of the works. This allows us not only depress prices, but
also made a lot of records in the hands of the client.
Furthermore, the distribution system capital cost without interest
advance if desired. So you do not have an investment budget to
have to carry out some work, but you pay the debt off by the
energy bill immediately (and only after repayment) lowering.
459.
You can apply in one place all energy subsidies. Distribution Network
act as a counter function. We unravel the tangle of current premiums and
application procedures and make sure you know all the possibilities, making the
government actively lowers the threshold to isolate energy saving.
460.
sp.a makes energy-efficient living more accessible to everyone by the
contribution levels to differentiate more strongly to the financing needs of your
family. As a result we are going to fight against energy poverty in Flanders.
461.
Social housing set an example. We
encourage them to take collective renovation projects on its feet. The Flemish
energy plays a supporting and funding role.
462.
We require owners of rental properties in addition to insulation, other
perform procedures that the energy performance of the property and therefore the cost of living
and the comfort of tenants fundamentally improves. We are thinking of
122 high-efficiency glass and condensing boilers. We reward landlords who a
energy efficient home through a rent rebate on property tax.
463.
sp.a wants electric heating in houses replaced by more efficient and
cheaper heating technique and develops an action plan for this purpose.
464.

sp.a draws up an action plan energy savings per sector (households,
industry, transportation, agriculture ...) formulates specific objectives and there too
a roadmap and links to resources. The government plays a here
example and sets its own targets for energy conservation
government buildings.

465.

sp.a wants extensive use of concluding materials cycles within
production processes. Due to the production of a good already used up
raw materials to use, we significantly reduce the need for energy. The
European materials directive and the eco-design directive should be up here
respond.

466.

sp.a itself fully to the use of waste heat. Heat released by
industrial production we discharge too often today in the air. We
use the residual heat for industrial processes or heating
buildings such as offices, greenhouses, hospitals, sports facilities or
residential area.

Investing in renewable energy
The future of the welfare state, our collective insurance for individual risk, it will
depend on how our economic system deals with new energy sources. Our
classic welfare state was built on economic growth respected on tapping
fossil fuel supplies and nuclear energy. The growing global demand puts the offer, however,
under pressure, prices propels the height and degrades the quality of our environment.
Which was successful yesterday, today actually works anymore. The economic growth of
tomorrow so needs other forms of energy. Here we go together.

467.

The European Union is well on its way to a binding target of 20 percent
get renewable energy by 2020. sp.a therefore calls for this
aim to tighten up to 30 percent and a binding target of 45
formulate percent renewable energy by 2030 so we 2050
succeed 100 percent to cover our energy needs with renewable
energy.

468.

We make renewable energy a sustainable and competitive at
compared to fossil fuel production, so that government support over time
becomes unnecessary. We do this by working out a long-term vision.

469.

sp.a want greater transparency about government support for fossil and
nuclear energy, both at European and national level. We conduct
The debate over the legality of government support
123

energy production based on correct figures and delete unauthorized
support. European funds, including the support of the European
investment bank, must be at the service of the environment and
climate objectives of the Union instead of the same objectives
undermine.
470.

We review the existing sustainability criteria for biofuels on co²reductiepotentieel and land use. Where biofuels made from biomass
is, can not be derived from food crops or crops are grown
be on land intended for food production. Biomass and
biomass residues that could have a high-quality application as
food, animal feed or raw materials are not stimulated direction
energy application. We introduce sustainability criteria for solid
biofuels used in power plants.

Fair and equitable energy bill
That renewable energy will cost something, we do not deny. But sp.a the opposition against him
statement that they would cost more than other production technologies. Europe absorbs fossil and
nuclear sector twice as much tax money as the renewable sector. The construction of two
new UK nuclear power stations proves that the support that the taxpayer can cough up a lot
higher than the support for wind and solar energy in Flanders. This observation holds sp.a
however, to monitor closely against the energy bill. By VAT on electricity from 21 to 6
percent decrease immediately we increased the purchasing power of our families. Now it boils
the strongest shoulders stronger letting contribute accordingly to the social and sustainable
energy policy. It unilaterally passing on some cost items (just think of the
costs for social or sustainable energy) in the energy bill today undermines
principle. Small consumers pay proportionately more. The transfer of the
distribution tariffs to Flanders creates a momentum to act accordingly.

471.

We count the social and sustainable energy no longer entirely through the
energy bill. We cap the contribution of our companies and households
for this policy at the current level by the freezing of
distribution tariffs should be extended until 2019 and the capping of federal
contribution. Extra costs we cover through general means such as income from
nuclear interest, revenue from the sale of CO² and uistootrechten
Entering the netvergoeding for solar panels.

472.

The increasing share of renewables leads on windy days and
sun to significant declines in the wholesale market. These price reductions
But not enough to seep through to the invoice of the final consumer. spa
wants to introduce the weekend rate at times of low demand and high
production, such as holidays.

473.

All illicit gains energy in the amortized
nuclear realizes we continue to skim. The nuclear interest rate remains the next
years maintained at 550 million euros.
124

474.

The revenue reserve of nuclear interest, we integrated the new
energy policy. We cover up the cost of offshore wind energy. On that
way pay the old technology with the new technology and avoid
we impact on the energy bill.

475.

We split the cost of our energy throughout Europe between fair
large and small consumers. The absence of a contribution from consumers
the cost of the transmission in some countries of the European Union
such as Germany and the Netherlands leads to the unauthorized passing on the cost
for netonderhoud and energy on the small consumers such as families or
SMEs. Moreover, exemptions in one country lead to enormous pressure on other
States such as Belgium, to also give exemptions to the
competitiveness of our businesses to sustain. With all asocial
consequences. sp.a wants the European Commission this illicit
forms of state support is limiting and the same rules apply to all
consumers.

476.

sp.a installs a uniform rate for all Flemish people in the same situation. The
costs for supporting renewable energy and social energy
should not depend on the area in which you live. It can not be that you pay more
because there happens to a lot of renewable energy is present in the neighborhood.

477.

sp.a builds on the free kilowatt hours of electricity for everyone and aims
a progressive distribution rate. The price for the first kilowatt hour
must be significantly less than the cost of the last consumed
kilowatt hours. This is not only socially, but also an incentive for
energy saving.

478.

We are expanding the social tariff for gas and electricity in all people
poverty. Firstly to those families who are entitled to it
omniostatuut or families in individual or collective debt.

479.

The social rate for natural gas will also be accessible to people connected
on a collective heating system such as is often the case in
apartment buildings.

480.

sp.a applies the social tariff for natural gas also increased heating through
heat networks. That way it will be interesting social example
heating neighborhoods through this sustainable and economically viable
technology.

481.

We develop an action plan in which we actively switching from heating
on oil to gas or renewable support.

482.

Each closing of energy is one too many. We maintain the sealing ban in the
winter period and set a budget meter as an alternative to closure. We
reduce the energy consumption of people at risk of fuel poverty
by free insulation measures and energy scans.

125

483.

We do this through its independent regulators strictly monitor the prices and
market. If the market does not work we step in again with the aim of lower prices
maintain control. To have a really good energy, is that it's better
no vendor and no producers over one third market share
going. We are still some way off.

484.

We make energy bills simpler and more transparent. Each supplier
uses the same standard invoice. Consumers clearly how costs
calculated and can easily compare between suppliers.

485.

sp.a wants payment plans with a realistic time frame. More than one-third of
families with debts to the energy supplier is unable to
repayment plan to follow. This indicates that the debt on a short term
to be paid off. This will drain to pay it off monthly amount to
high. A more realistic deadline for repayment is not only good for the
customer, but also for the supplier, because he is more certain of
effective repayment of debt.

486.

A guarantee which requires an energy supplier to a customer may never higher
are two monthly installments. The deposit is automatically
refunded if the consumer first year accounted pay on time.

Security of supply requires European cooperation
Supply needs in times of nuclear phase-out to be a problem, but they should not
unilateral national approached. That would be the amount of expenditure unnecessarily high in hunting.
And that is what is happening today. Achieving security of supply in a cost effective manner
means for sp.a, besides saving energy, investments in the national and European network.
Today invests each Member State for itself, making Europe a structural overcapacity
realize. By only meet within their own borders to the demand there are plants that literally
but one or two days of running per year and therefore require high public support to viable
are. By working together and to connect countries, we can lower energy across Europe
guarantee. A Single Market for tomatoes still works well only if there are ways to make this
to be transported?

487.

The European Union guarantees with the national supply by a
coordinated supply in times of peak demand (which occurs in limited production
and to formulate high demand). Only coordinated action guarantees
cost-efficient supply. A national solution, wherein each land
builds its own emergency power plants is far too expensive. It is up to Europe to provide
sufficient reserve capacity for the single market.

488.

The European response to peak demand focuses on the flexible reducing
Industrial demand at times of high demand and limited supply. For
is, for example, the industrial players. possible refrigeration for a while
a few degrees to keep less cool. Opposite this effort is a
proper compensation.
126

489.

The Belgian electricity network is encapsulated in a stronger European network.
An enhanced European network allows us to produce energy wherever they
hands. Europe realizes, in cooperation with Member States,
capital investment to set up this network. These bear comparison
the European mobility network.

490.

The domestic power grid, the first place is reinforced at locations
where the power of the future will take place: in marine areas, on
farms or in people's homes. Also knows the network to
go with a less predictable range.

491.

Europe invests in the energy storage where the technology for hands
is like reservoirs in mountainous areas or at sea. Moreover, investing
Europe in research and development of storage technologies that are not yet ready for the market
are such as storage in large and small batteries.

Nuclear energy gives us no certainty
Regarding nuclear energy can not choose the society between 'safe' or 'risky'
paths, but there are various risky options invariably coexist. The nuclear disaster in Fukushima
shows that the impact of a nuclear incident in the society and economy in
densely populated country is unimaginable. We can not climate change risks
counter by putting the risks of nuclear energy (with accompanying afvalprodcutie)
opposite to place. sp.a continues to insist on the closure of the nuclear power plants.
Leaving choices in the last century takes difficult decisions about responsibility
regarding the high-level radioactive waste with them today and in the future.
Also depends on the decommissioning and disposal of the waste a cost.
Financial commissions, which were built above his or accounting available,
they are not available for more than once they are invested long-term in distant lands. This
brings with it risks for taxpayers. For sp.a can not privatized
benefits in times of operation, corporate expense after closing. Costs must behave
by those they realize.

492.

sp.a insists on the withdrawal from nuclear energy
electricity production. Between 2015 and 2025 close all our power stations.

Industrial

493.

We ensure that sufficient resources will be available for the purpose of
decommissioning, decontamination and disposal of radioactive material and installations. Certainly
questions the resources that are necessary following the closure of nuclear power plants
further availability guarantees.

494.

We are strengthening the research and development
innovative technologies aimed at dismantling, remediation and mountains
nuclear materials.

127

495.

We guarantee that there is also a production facility in the future in Belgium
radioactive isotopes remains present for medical imaging.

496.

High-level radioactive waste should, once recovered, are always reclaimed. We make
So no way for taking on any decision to be final
closure of a disposal facility by future generations. Only in this
how can we ensure long-term monitoring and security.

497.

The consequences of a nuclear incident are not stopped by national
boundaries. Strengthened European policy coordination is therefore necessary for
nuclear safety, nuclear waste transportation, treatment and disposal of
nuclear waste.

Research and innovation for tomorrow's energy
Who will soon have the technology, with rising fuel prices, in the most efficient manner
renewable energy to generate? The need for market-ready generating and storage techniques, but also
the new complexity of the netorganisatie put research and innovation at the heart of the
energy policy. Research and innovation making techniques economically viable. For example, the could
support for renewable energy decline because a good return
is guaranteed. The production costs for renewable energy will decrease and internationally
continue to do so in the future. We are therefore in knowledge, marketing and exporting of
in view of the economic growth of tomorrow.

498.

We turn the potential of geothermal energy to. Heat from deep underground
is a constant source of energy, which she lends itself to collective
heat networks to connect.

499.

Socialist Party opposes the exploitation of shale gas in Flanders, Belgium and
Europe. From the perspective of public health, the environment and the climate
This mining technique irresponsible. Furthermore, shale gas in Europe can not
grow into "game changer". European soils is difficult to exploit
whereby production costs in Europe are twice as high as in the United
States. Moreover, the gas reserves too small and the population density is too high.

500.

The government supports research into breakthrough technologies such as
storage techniques at sea and on land. The possibility of energy against
affordable price for storing long period represents a major
a breakthrough in renewable energy landscape. For example, the production can be done in more
one moment to absorb the minproductie at another time. We
support in this respect the Flemish dredging industry expertise to
build, market, and export them in the future.

501.

Smart electricity meters, which ensure that the demand for electricity
is shifted to those moments when there is a large range, are in the
Firstly, rolled out to those consumers that are also able, in practice, their

128

to send electricity demand. For retail customers, including families, the cost is
too high and the impact on the electricity bill low.
502.

We grouping or clustering the energy knowledge within companies, universities
and research is available to better validate new knowledge.

Everyone energy through government
The distribution network has a high public-good content. Nobody can or should be excluded from
access to the network. Moreover, stands or falls with the energy changes of the net. At
excellence, the owner of this network must therefore social objective shape. Therefore
the distribution remains at all times in public hands, and can not, not even partially, by
private owners are run. Which government manages the network obviously cost efficient.

503.

Flanders is evolving in the short term to pure distribution
whose ownership remains at all times in the hands of local governments. The
these boards are the local base of the grid guarantee the best.

504.

The distribution further simplify their structures and deletion
unnecessary mandates.

505.

Flanders does not participate in the distribution system. In this way we avoid
conflict of interest. Otherwise Flanders both the tariff for grid
determine if exercise control over the legality of that rate.

506.

We carry a uniform distribution rate for all Flemings. For this,
we evolve in the medium term towards a merger between the
distribution and a merger between the two companies Eandis
and Infrax.

507.

Local authorities withdraw as quickly as possible from participation in
commercial energy supply.

508.

Local governments only participate in renewable energy production within
Flanders, including the North Sea. They have this special attention to
support and participation in local consumer cooperatives.

4.4 Together build a healthy environment
The fine dust that our health is at risk or the flooding that makes our cellars
flooded are no fatal phenomena that beset us. The are all environmental risks
which we created ourselves and where we as a society therefore have an impact on.
Contemporary environmental problems effortlessly follow the globalization of our economic system.
Local economic production (mainly) local markets led in the last century
Local curb odor and noise pollution or contamination of surface water. These traditional
129

pollution unfortunate enough not belong to the past, but anno 2013
many visible forms of environmental pollution on their return. New (er) challenges such as
climate change, resource depletion and biodiversity loss differ hereof
fundamentally. For example, because these complex phenomena which manifest themselves globally
national policy will be difficult to hold on. For example, it leads to only limited success of international
climate negotiations to a feeling of helplessness. However, this finding does not paralyze us. spa
continues to believe in a European Union that expands beacons and enhanced cooperation between
continents on the world stage. Moreover, we note that one and the other moves from the bottom
in society, and that is hopeful. If it was formerly the government that your family and companies
hand took on the way to cleaner products and production processes, taking those same families and
More and more, today the lead itself. Predecessor Companies to pursue maximum efficiency
use of raw materials after families and develop initiatives aimed at sharing
cars or garden equipment, repairing worn stuff or swapping clothes. sp.a plays
in this, because we get a handle returned by common action in this contemporary
challenges that the welfare of all those who come after us in places uncertain prospects. The
comes to sp.a so on to support the existing social dynamics by
businesses, bring families, society and research institutions in order to get
knowledge to develop, share and take action. That way we couple replies
environmental challenges up to economic opportunities.
Provide answers to environmental problems, but we do not only out of solidarity with future
generations. The question of who contributes what environmental risks today or the cost of environmental policy
his account takes no detail. Where freedom is an unfulfilled promise as a result of the
ecological crisis? Who lost healthy years by too much fine dust to breathe? Whose basement is
often under extremely wet weather in? Who is able water use and corresponding invoice
printing and who is not? Who is green and quiet hard to reach? Today, environmental pollution
too bright passed on the most vulnerable such as children, elderly, sick or poor people.
Environmental Justice is sp.a no empty concept. A pleasant living environment and the cost
to achieve this must be fairly shared. A policy aimed at improving
of the environment can for sp.a therefore only be truly sustainable if everyone can co-tapping it.

A transparent and affordable water bill
In Flanders, water is an extremely scarce resource. Even in warm countries like Spain, Portugal or
Greece is the water availability per capita is much higher than in Flanders. Nevertheless
sp.a accepts the increasing share of the water bill in the income not just happen. For sp.a is
access to affordable water is a basic right. Not only are more people struggling
to pay their water bill. Moreover, the water bills are not sufficiently transparent.

509.

Water is not a commercial product. Drinking water can never be subject to
profit. sp.a anchors the public character of the complete water cycle
(purification, transportation, production and distribution) into law.

510.

There will be one rate for drinking water in Flanders. It is not that one
Fleming longer pay for his drinking because he has the bad luck that no
130

water source is present in its environment. In this way, there is hidden
competition among water companies. Since the end user is not
better. In this context, Flanders must invest in
concatenating the various water networks.
511.

To
the
example
from
the
energy sector
simplify
the
drinking water intermunicipal their structure and delete them significantly in the
number of paid directorships.

512.

The control of the water bill is a Flemish competence. We are the
existing prudential supervision of the water bill for a genuine Flemish
regulator. Which ensures that the water bill is correct and on a
transparent is established. For this, the regulator has access to all
necessary information and can enforce decisions.

513.

We give more people the status of "protected customers". They get a
significant discount on their water bill. In the first place people with a
OMNIO or people who are in a process of debt
budget counseling are. We guide them automatically to their
water consumption to keep under control. Thus, we reduce the risk of
water poverty.

514.

It is the local government today decides who for any amount of a
exemption on municipal sanitation contribution can enjoy. This undermines the
equal treatment of families and social groups in Flanders. We apply a
minimum rate of exemption for edge protection to throughout Flanders.

515.

As the costs for the development and maintenance of our sewerage very
high a municipality can only use the municipal sanitation contribution
for the investment in new sewers, replacement and maintenance of existing
sewerage infrastructure.

516.

We actively encourage the reuse of waste water companies, farmers
or households. In this way we close the water cycle.

517.

sp.a performs a progressive distribution rate. The cost for the first used
cubic meters of water is then significantly lower than the cost for the last
consumed cubic meters of water. That is not only social, it is also a reward
saving water.

518.

We review the exceptions to the water companies
given to deviate from the obligation to connect families in which
regions systematically to high levels of nitrite, nitrate and phosphorus found
in the well water.

Certain water quality
The quality of the Flemish river and stream water improves slowly but steadily. Still meet
still too few waterways to the quality standards imposed by Europe.
131

519.

The next river basin management include greater guarantees
effectively achieving these standards. We give priority to
sensitive areas.

520.

Too much nitrate as a result of fertilizer use in agriculture threatens the
surface water and thus also the drinking water supply in Belgium. The Flemish
manure action plan does not achieve the expected results. We close the rear gate
the manure decree that allows expansion of livestock. In this way
we achieve a gradual reduction of livestock and the odor or fine
dust emissions associated with it.

521.

We sharpen area-the decretal provisions of the
manure action plan in those focus areas where the quality of water bodies worst
is under the pressure.

522.

Farmers are eligible for smoother fertilization as they
entering into binding and long-term commitments with respect to the realization
additional nature, on top of the basic quality of nature, such as pool and berms
riparian zones in agricultural areas.

523.

Climate change not only creates an excess of water during heavy rainfall.
Also, water shortage is a frequently underestimated problem in Flanders. Flanders
very dependent on imports. The springs that we have must be so good
manage. In 2017 a new tax rate for groundwater use must
are recorded. And that tax must pay more attention to the
groundwater in a region.

524.

We simplify the water legislation and ensure better coordination
between different decrees and implementation.

525.

We abolish the polders and water. The provinces take over these tasks.

We give waste a second life
The Flemish waste policy has ensured that the amount of household and commercial waste the
in recent years has decreased and composted more than two-thirds of household waste,
reused or recycled. sp.a wants to build on this by not only at the end of
the life cycle of a product to be attentive to recycling, but also at the time of
production itself reused materials to use. In this way we not only ensure that there
also sufficient resources for future generations will be present, but we reduce
GHG emissions from production processes sensitive. Must break this cycle thinking
in all economic sectors. Europe consumes more than its fair share of raw materials
of the world and therefore it is responsible for social inequality and environmental damage elsewhere.

132

526.

sp.a wants to close materials cycles. The idea that time and again waste
serves as material needs time horizon within a new production
permeate across all economic sectors. For this purpose we develop a
policy tailored to professional sectors such as construction, metal or
chemical sector which ecological and economic potential looked up
becomes. We focus on them our efforts on research and development.

527.

Because different players can learn a lot from each other Flemish places
government forerunner projects on closing the materials loop active
in the attention.

528.

The European Waste Framework Directive we adapt because that directive succeeds today
still insufficient in order to bring the desired waste hierarchy in practice.
Materials with potential for reuse, such as timber, end up in the EU is still too
often at the landfill or incinerator.

529.

High-quality recycling of waste is still above the burning of waste. The
number of incinerators in Flanders must be so well planned. A
Excess incinerators recycling business out of the market.

530.

The European directive 'eco' has a huge impact on the energy-efficient
making appliances. The revision of this Directive should continue now
go in the fight against overconsumption by also binding regulations on the
efficient use and recycling of raw materials (water, materials) to enforce.
We also extend the Directive to other product groups such as clothing and
building materials and they cover the entire life cycle of products into account
bring.

531.

Governments focus on innovation by incorporating their exemplary turd and in their
tender behavior to provide maximum opportunities for recycled products.

532.

Until the 80s there was a lot of waste dumped in Flanders. Flanders must
sensible use of this historic deposit. They often contain hazardous waste
and there is need for remediation. But even so, we find useful materials for
our economy back. This we must recuperate.

533.

In 2010 marketed 95 billion plastic carrier bags in the EU,
of which 92 per cent was intended for single use only. These plastics are
very harmful to the health of man and the environment. Additionally contain
they are heavy metals which make them difficult to recycle. sp.a want this
banning plastic single-use products at the latest by 2016.

534.

sp.a also tackles the excessive packaging of products and
nutrition and suggests a widespread imposition and collection of a special
bag for plastic waste. Waste may in this bag, get one point rose as
labeling.

535.

The dumping of waste in another (our neighboring) countries where processing
cheaper but often proceeds inferior can not. In this context, we strengthen
133

control illegal export of electronic waste and set up in the
recovery of valuable raw materials from waste.
536.

Industrial waste that is similar in composition should be included in household waste
are in the household waste collection circuit. In this way, not only
families as well as select companies in an affordable way with waste.

537.

To facilitate sort we label products for the blue bag
with a blue tip.

538.

Producers of waste, we propose to a greater extent be responsible for the
processing of waste produced. We implement this framework in view to deposit
active litter counter.

539.

sp.a reaffirmed the goal of all historical contaminated by 2036
remediate soils in Flanders. We focus priorities on those grounds
which have an impact on living conditions of vulnerable groups in the
society and those lands that are ecologically and / or economically valuable.
Furthermore, we aim to shorten the duration of this
remediation files.

540.

Hazardous substances cause serious health damage we banned. We
develop in this context an active asbestos removal policy. Moreover
We support research into "new" hazardous substances likely to harmful
for humans and the environment as micro-plastics and nanoparticles.

Together climate safeguard
The climate issue remains the most challenging international environment file. Climate Change
has a disruptive effect on our (world) economy and society. sp.a remains committed
for the establishment of an internationally binding climate agreement. A global problem
demands a global solution. But we are convinced that even on a small scale
level, in our cities and towns and the difference must be made. Initiatives like
the Covenant of Mayors, in which many local governments commit themselves to extensive reduction
CO² gets our full support. A large part of the energy consumption and the
GHG emissions associated with urban activities. Initiatives like 'Leuven
climate neutral 'also demonstrate that commitment at the local level on climate neutrality quality
environment improves visible and immediate for every resident. This can be through the deployment in
bicycle streets, vegetarian meals at school, etc ...

541.

The European climate change targets for 2030 should have been focused on the final
to achieve complete elimination of CO² emissions by 2050. Advocates in this context
sp.a for a binding reduction of greenhouse gases by 30 percent by 2020
and 50 percent by 2030. As for energy conservation will sp.a binding
target of 40 percent by 2030. Moreover, the European energy needs
2030 for 45 percent renewable production exist.
134

542.

The Belgian climate is in a deadlock. sp.a puts priority on the realization
of a cooperation agreement between the regions and the federal government to
policy efforts, auction results and international
distributes funding effort between the federal and regional governments.
This is extremely urgent because necessary to have a powerful stroke and
coordinated Flemish and Belgian climate policy to unfurl.

543.

Only a truly representative United Nations can credibly role
realize representative of the world community. A reform
arises then on. The EU will have a common seat in the
Security. In addition, the relationships between continents
straightened by also developing regions to give a clear voice.

544.

We realize the climate targets up within Flanders. On that
Thus we have more control over the quality of the projects. By priority
in turn saving energy we also support Flemish families
and companies can financially benefit from lower power consumption.
Buy emission abroad can therefore only as a last resort.

545.

sp.a resists speculation with emission rights. It can not do that
allowances are sold expensive to later cheaper allowances
abroad to purchase.

546.

Our commitments to support these developing countries
most affected by extreme weather phenomena we solve priority in
with revenues from the auctioning of emissions rain. This contribution must also
systematically increase.

547.

Going Flemish funds from the climate fund for at least 50 percent to
internal measures within Flanders. These measures are cost-effective and
can get a broad interpretation. Likewise, the creation of forests CO²
Saving financed with these funds.

548.

Companies that receive funds from the climate fund use this integral to
supporting climate by investing in energy efficiency.
In this way they reduce their energy dependency, reducing their
improves competitiveness.

549.

The climate plan is a dynamic plan that is reviewed annually, allowing
maximum is taken into account new insights. So we can
always implement the most cost efficient measures.

550.

Europe is investing in energy efficiency for large industry profitable.
GHG emissions is too cheap today. To realize this, it recalls
short term the ETS. An instrument that is fully
based on market forces fail if the market reacts differently than expected. The
achieving climate goals will come too easily undermined
to stand. sp.a advocates the introduction of a floor price for emission rights
the reducing the number of emission rights.
135

551.

Eventually replace sp.a the emissions trading system by a CO² tax for that
sectors which are now subject to the ETS. As a result, will
CO² price system more predictable and transparent. This is the
investment security from the person who pays for the better. In order to avoid
This system leads to 'the payer pollutes "we associate with this tax a maximum
emission standard.

Clean air for all
Average losing a Flemish in Flanders one healthy life years from exposure to particulate matter.
Furthermore, this exposure is distributed very unevenly. In susceptible individuals such as the elderly, children
or asthma, this figure is significantly higher. Doubled the number of asthma sufferers in Europe
Over the past 30 years. Moreover, it is often less affluent neighborhoods near busy
weigh those peaks get process to particulate matter. Emissions of particulate matter is a prime
environmental problem passed on the weak. For sp.a that finding
unacceptable. Breathing should never make you sick and therefore gets healthy air a priority
place in the Flemish environmental policy.

552.

sp.a advocates at European level for stricter standards for emissions
fine dust that keeps more attention to the health effects of these emissions
and which focuses on the standards of the World Health Organisation. The
tightening of standards we associate with policies at European level
ambitious emission standards for transport, industry, power plants and
Agriculture formulates. We know that this can work, because previous legislation
air quality in Europe has benefited.

553.

New research suggests that burning wood more particulate emissions than
we thought before. sp.a would like to replace old, polluting
stoves by modern stoves maximum boost.

554.

sp.a outspoken advocates for low-traffic and traffic-free towns and villages by
further expansion of car parks and public transport; the transition to
sustainable vehicles through stricter EURO standards; greening the
traffic load; an ambitious commitment to electric mobility and smarter
bundling of goods flows through town distribution centers in our cities.

555.

We close the back gate in the manure decree to expand the herd
makes possible. In this way we achieve a gradual reduction of the
Livestock and fine dust emissions associated with it.

Sustainable agriculture
The farmer today is a true entrepreneur who has an eye for economic viability and
innovation. Yet we have to conclude that the policy has paid too little attention to the
quality of the environment and a number of charges associated with agriculture. Just think
the impact on water quality or the acidification and eutrophication of the soil. It is obvious
136

that in a changing climate (with flooding and drought as a result) the agricultural sector
First, is sharing in the fold. We go into partnership with farmers and entrepreneurs in
the sector and together determine the agricultural policy of the future.

556.

The socio-economic viability of the agricultural sector depends to a large
extent on the world market and of the European agricultural policy. sp.a calls
for to better use the available European funds for companies
they really needed (eg. start-up entrepreneurs or companies
in difficulty). The capping of direct income in this respect
an important step.

557.

In return, the active agricultural sector contributes financial support to the sustainable
be of the sector and the free supply of certain services, such as a
attractive scenery and a sufficient base of nature in the agricultural
area. The resources of the VLIF support (support for agriculture and horticulture)
are used for the reduction of natural resources such as fossil
fuels (chemical) fertilizers, pesticides and water. Special attention
is given to the meat industry.

558.

In Flanders lost annually 2.3 million tonnes of food. The food chain
between producers and consumers must be shortened and loss should the move
be avoided. Wasting food is reprehensible, especially when many Flemish
children with an empty lunchbox at school sit. Should in this context
all citizens before dates properly know to interpret. sp.a embarking on a
clearer labeling and awareness through supermarkets.

559.

sp.a committed to fair and transparent pricing in the food chain. Doing this
we through controls on the fair distribution of profit margins in the different
links of the chain.

560.

We encourage organic farming by farmers who want to switch
actively guide and eliminating administrative or financial obstacles.

561.

The success of allotments indicates a value for the neighborhood. She
stimulating encounter and engagement. We therefore support state agriculture
requiring the use of pesticides and fertilizers is avoided.

562.

sp.a stimulates knowledge related to genetic material
living organisms. Free and basic scientific research is crucial.

563.

In view of the large uncertainties associated with the use of genetically
modified organisms (GMOs) in food production (environment,
biodiversity and socio-economic impacts for those citizens who are dependent
Agriculture) sp.a wants the traditional reluctance of Europe (which
GMOs are almost absent maintain in our store shelves).

137

564.

Socialist Party opposes the unauthorized patenting of seeds in hands
some multinationals. Checking multinationals thereby systematically
food production and making farmers dependent on that industry.

A society that is concerned about animals
565.

Animal welfare is in the transfer of these powers to the regions a
specific and global positioning within the Flemish government and administration. sp.a is
advocate for animal welfare with the authority specifically to minister
pointing and not to coincide with the jurisdictional domain Agriculture
that conflicts of interest are avoided.

566.

We raise awareness of vegetarianism and the benefits to this
are joined by promoting Thursday Veggie Day in schools, businesses
and families.

567.

sp.a side formally against animal experiments, for which alternatives exist.
The existing experiments will put stop to primates (apes). We
calling for a European label which is made clear which
Products there is made use of tests on animals.

568.

sp.a against breeding of animals for their fur. We do not provide new
permits for fur farms and existing permits extinguish short
-term.

569.

Castration of piglets without anesthesia is prohibited

570.

Animals are too often sold miskweekt where by they are unmanageable
be. The sale of dogs and cats from other litters than the home-bred
should therefore be a clear sideline. The sale of animals from other
countries must meet all the Belgian conditions. We advocate at European
level standards for the breeding and trading of cats and dogs.
We advocate for better control, inter alia, to avoid broodfok.

571.

We support the efforts made by cities and towns
stray cats to be sterilized. That way they go cat overpopulation
against. This measure prevents needless animal suffering and is the nuisance
certain districts or neighborhoods against.

572.

sp.a pays attention to the survival of endangered species and
biodiversity. The urban environment and modern agricultural and horticultural techniques
have a negative impact on populations of bees, butterflies, birds etc ... It is
therefore imperative to take steps to its extinction
occur. Certainly what the bee population is concerned there is a need for new
measures to protect the environment from chemicals. These measures
should be developed at European level.

573.

We advocate at European level to reduce the transport of animals to a
maximum of eight hours.
138

Efficient environmental efficient government
An environmental policy requires an efficient state. Take the most appropriate policy
measures for its inhabitants that have an immediate impact on the livability of the neighborhood.
To immediately and visibly improve the living environment of families need action
more than once to be taken at local level. It is also at local level that a lot of initiative
slicing is possible. Families who organize and activities aimed at reusing stuff,
the parts of the vehicle or allotments ask concrete support. Local governments should therefore
have the necessary resources.
In addition, a fair environment which will not bear the society for the
pollution of an individual. In many cases, environmental pollution makes it difficult to live together.
Just think of fly tipping or noise nuisance. Especially now that the planning and the
environmental permit be merged into a single environmental permit, the challenge is also
enforcement in both domains optimally align.

574.

sp.a believes that environmental policy in many cases in need of local
execution. Therefore local authorities have the appropriate resources and people.
We redo an environmental agreement, which supports local governments in
concrete actions to improve the environment. The funds from the covenant are
even more versatile for the environment, nature, spatial planning and mobility.

575.

Real behavior we realize sustainable through education. Environmental and
nature education for sp.a essential. We support schools
also bring environmental awareness into practice by meat consumption
school meals to reduce or biking together 'from and to school
organize.

576.

We make environmental and urban maintenance powerful blow by them
merge. Enforcement in Flanders in a similar way
exercised. There will be a proper tit-for-tat policy whereby police, customs,
regional control and local governments work together. Special
attention we have for checks on the illegal export of car wrecks and
electronic waste. Dumping of waste in Third World countries is ethical
irresponsible, because the most pure form of shift of environmental burdens
the weakest. Also animal welfare given the necessary attention.

4.5. Spatial Planning: The quality of our space determines how we live together
Introduction: Solidarity requires space

139

The choice of how we give a district, a neighborhood, village, city or region in the Flanders of tomorrow
is never voluntary. The impact on the economic development of a region, but also at the
quality of everyday life is too great. Policies that constitutes our physical environment,
expresses who we are or want to be. The way we see the good life translates
literally on the property. We deny you opportunities as jobs are literally unreachable because
companies appear haphazardly in the Flemish landscape. We drive our water and energy bill the
by height in residential misguided schedule. We accept more casualties as
we maintain the historical choice of ribbon development. And less space for water
implies in times of climate change, increasing economic damage to high precipitation.
Then choose sp.a for more people to work by activity in reach areas
organizing; affordable bills by building homes in places that provide easy
are energy and water (purification); to provide less road deaths by area
for cyclists and fully focusing on low-traffic residential areas; for receiving
climate change by precipitation where it can be to penetrate the soil.
Moreover, and for sp.a no detail determines the quality of our public space the way
which people live and meet together. Generates an unsafe or unpleasant neighborhood
distrust, a pleasant park just confidence. The 'big' solidarity from above (our social
security) needs approachable solidarity from below. Because we are through mutual contact
in our neighborhood, the station or on the bike path along the canal to determine whether the other solidarity or
is worth. The logical sp.a attention given to the quality of the public space is therefore
not only motivated by the right of everyone to a healthy and liveable environment, but results
equally the result of our continuous quest for a necessary support for what
really reshuffles, our welfare state.
Just because of its social driving force is the limited effectiveness of the
spatial policy in Flanders outrageous. The way out of the current reality of difficult
realizable prisons, stadiums and power lines, however, does not lie in more 'freedom -
happiness 'or' top-down technocracy. Both run partnership and therefore the joint
importance. Then choose sp.a for a new policy framework which realizes time savings by the trust
between developer, governments, families and society by restoring basic
cooperation based on equality a central place for the formal start of each
spatial project. A policy framework upward collective solutions above all for himself
place. Kleiner live offers the possibility to challenging the vacated public space and
car-free to set up. High energy bills counter we easily by investing together in
a heat our homes heated with heat produced at the nearby
industrial estate. We do not just have a greater focus on joint use of space
infrastructure for sustainable space requires them, but just as well because we will
to gain comfort.

A Flemish framework for a healthy and pleasant living environment
The increase in population, economic growth and climate change challenge our space.
More people and smaller families provide an increasing need for more and smaller
homes. Economic growth implies, a higher mobility demand and climate change
site to flooded basements. Complex challenges require creative policy. A government that
140

this creativity through codes, rules and procedures cripples organizes the arrest. Yet pleads not sp.a
less Flemish government, or for another Flemish government. A framework-government
which formulates clear and enforceable limits and maintain. A government that says what can and
can not, rather than rules to issue of how something is to be achieved. This guarantees
the right to a healthy and pleasant environment for everyone, and we wallow environmental
Do not print on the weakest. Only when we guarantee it creates a playing field in which possible
becomes.
577.

The Flemish government puts priority preconditions for spatial
development and efficient tools to achieve this. This
conditions are enforceable. Enforcement is carried out by the central Flemish
government. To this end, the enforcement bodies be strengthened and the
necessary guarantees provided for the independence of the enforcers. In this
framework we provide a transparent, clear and coherent legislative framework.

The comfort of accessibility

578.

We build verkeersgenererend infrastructure such as large offices,
stadiums ... just where we can unlock payable by
quality public transport.

579.

New housing estates are built in locations that match the
built-up area of ​​a municipal residential area. As a result, are
basic services such as education and quality public transport nearby. . On
That way we guarantee not only the comfort of accessibility for all
Flemings,
but
as well
a
cost-efficient
exploitation
from
community facilities such as public transport and utilities infrastructure.

580.

Around new public transport lines and nodes is a compulsory
certain degree of compaction achieved, as is already the case in Switzerland.

581.

We utilize the space around the many Flemish stations better. This space
grows from quality hubs for transport and meeting. You step
not only on the train, you meet people for coffee, there hires a
bike sharing or car share or take your child to the nursery.

582.

People who live in existing urban or village, we reward you with a relatively
higher living bonus. Through their choice of housing they save the company after all
cost much, and we put that into account. Residential tax is such a new and
efficient instrument of planning.

583.

We build the open space running into a diverse landscape where there is room for
water, food, nature and gentle recreation (hiking, cycling). This
Functions include not stereotypical together, but interwoven within one
area. Here we always start from the specific characteristics of a
region.

141

584.

Bringing together different functions in urban areas means
social and environmental added value. The (temporary) opening up of
undeveloped land for gardening promotes encounter between neighbors.
Many initiatives open in Flanders, but the policy is lagging behind
social trends. sp.a wants to support these initiatives through
removing barriers in the legislation.

Every square meter counts
585.

We develop clear standards for the utilization and design of
new areas. In this way we minimize space and energy
and we maximize actual employment at the industrial sites. We
make enormous profits by building space in the height or depth, by
a joint parking lot to build, sort, aggregate waste or water
purify.

586.

The Flemish government is developing a uniform methodology for the vacancy in
bringing the Flemish cities and municipalities in the picture. Moreover, it stimulates the
effective recovery of a vacancy charge locally.

587.

The government compacted urban cores quality. It is certainly not only
focused on more concrete, but also at a more green lungs. An urban forest on
biking distance, a park within walking distance, a view of a tree from each property is
sp.a for the purpose.

588.

Economic and social needs change faster than buildings. Therefore
it is necessary it can change new infrastructure simple function
over time. If a sports hall should be able to be converted to
concert is given here most attention from the design phase.
Moreover, we take it away legislative barriers that flexible
obstruct changes.

589.

A government that is supposed to represent the collective interest, needs
resources to pursue this. Authorities put stronger than today at
(temporary) land. So we have more control over the quality of
project developments, without stifling the creativity of the market. Below
other income of vacancy levy be used to achieve
an authentic land bank. Can acquire land by making more use of
instruments such as pre-emption.

590.

Governments put more effort parcel exchange. Necessary condition for this
that the government has a land bank. At that time they can ill
lying land well located for easy swapping land. Not only can
land in flood-prone area can be balanced risk-free
soils, also for the protection of forests designated zone or compacting
nuclei from distant locations to exchange with economic functions for a
location close to the core plot exchange is an effective tool.

142

We avoid wet feet
591.

We are introducing the principle "space for water" and are adhering to the
four-stage strategy: Hold -infiltreren - mountains and finally drains. On the
outer region we set up within the context of infiltrate in the first place in at
restoring former canals and we kept existing canals.

592.

Climate change leads to more extreme weather events in Flanders.
Also in Flanders will have to be collected at peak times more water
be. Our sewer system is therefore under severe pressure, with flooding up
result. We should therefore not just this rainwater with wastewater
send sewage into. But the current approach where we in densely populated areas
mixed rainwater and wastewater discharge into the sewer system impinges on its
limits. This approach drives the invoice unauthorized rising. "Every man for himself 'is
therefore expensive. Affordable solutions we reach only by working together.
Collective solutions, we rainwater in times of abundant
precipitation temporary aboveground catch in the public space is often much
cheaper. The Flemish government encourages creative solutions by the code
good practice for this to open, and the ability to provide a
rainwater plan to add in the drafting of municipal
sewerage implementation plans.

593.

If the legislation required to build a cistern, it must also
be connected to housekeeping functions. Rainwater can be used easily
for the flushing of the toilet or even the washing machine. In this way
we not only reduce the water bill, but we avoid the rain water
overflowing and yet the pressure on the sewerage network boosts.

594.

On the outer area we put in the first place in the repair of
former canals and we kept existing canals.

595.

The updated Sigma plan to protect the environment of the Scheldt against
flooding. This project is a fine example of how protection
flood and natural creation can go hand in hand. We provide sufficient
means to execute this plan, in accordance with the scheduled timing and start a
similar plan for other flood-prone basins.

596.

Flood sensitive area catches up on water. We weigh or hard

water to provide buffering.

597.

Because more extreme weather events due to climate change
entails that we must safeguard absorb more water in less time
We open space for further development. It is in the first place, the
developer (and not the taxpayer) which the responsibility here
for bears. Induration at the one location has to be compensated by a physical
more infiltration in a different place. Financial compensation to the government
employs to collectively compensate for his less desirable, because they
143

offsets enable developers in the state responsibility to print
buy.
598.

Regarding existing pavement we introduce a levy for large paved
surfaces (such as car parks or industrial) which does not allow water to infiltrate
in the ground, but direct discharge into the sewer system. This increases the cost of a
properly functioning sewer system so the cost is passed on to the
society.

599.

In real estate projects, such as land development, we set up at least 10 percent of the
surface with water courses, green areas and open water infiltration. On
That way we provide storage capacity so that homes and businesses dry
remain.

600.

The defense of our coastline against extreme weather demands
an innovative plan of action that starts from an overall vision. Ad hoc actions will on
term not suffice. Safety and increased experience of nature on the coast
go hand in hand if we commit a controlled flooding areas along
the coastal dunes of development between waterline and city. Moreover, this is the
affordability of an effective safety benefit.

601.

We focus on energy-efficient spatial structure. We reduce demand
to to mobility by homes and businesses built in cores. In addition,
we focus in our room so that it is suitable for cycling, both in the city
and beyond. Energy-efficient design of our space as well means
we did not lose let go industrial heat in the air, but just
use to surrounding buildings (homes, hospitals, sports hall ...) to
heating.

Protect nature

602.

The accelerated decline of biodiversity in the EU has turned against 2020
are. Below that requires more sustained strengthening of the Natura 2000
European network of protected areas and the realization of certain
nature targets
(conservation targets) .We
protect
and
realize the Flemish Ecological Network. This is to say that there are at least 15,000
hectares in five years or 3,000 hectares per year as a nature reserve managed
surface added. The Socialist Party wants the Flemish government sufficiently above
budget releases and allowances and Subsidisation adapts to the rising
land prices. This fragmented structure of nature and forest reserves is
necessary for the support of biodiversity in Flanders, but makes
it is also possible to Flemish nature plenty to do. In this context we create
more sanctuaries.

603.

We provide a real protection of the polder grasslands and historic
permanent grasslands. The purchases of nature by governments or
associations such as Natuurpunt remains the best guarantee of nature for the
144

future. Both the Flemish government and the province is increasing the use of
the instrument of 'pre-emption rights. "
604.

The nature thousands of volunteers and a strong midfield ensure
public support for conservation and contribute significantly to the
execution of the Flemish nature. The sp.a remain the land management
environmental associations recognized as a strong partner in the execution of the
Flemish nature on the property. The implementation of this procurement on a
equitable manner remain supported.

605.

By analogy with the tax shelter mechanism for film production, with
companies can invest in a tax-friendly way in the sector, will
sp.a develop a similar taxation system for the purchase of nature.

606.

2020 has all urban and a suburban area about an edge of the city.
We pay extra attention to the accessibility of these forests. Smooth
With the local public transport is a must.

607.

We reform the system of individual management contracts to an
system of collective, area and result-oriented management agreements
with groups of farmers and other land users. In this way
encourage collaboration between farmers, nature and other bodies
stakeholders in the management of an area.

608.

The plan for spatial planning at sea we all activity on the
North Sea matched and determined nature zones. The windmill zones and
energy atolls in the North Sea are perfect for active nature.
sp.a wants to use these sites on experimental development of artificial
reefs and nesting sites that will benefit biodiversity in the North Sea.
Moreover, we also put in other natural areas defined in the sea, such as the
Natura 2000 areas, on strengthening nature. The
measures in these valuable areas are closely monitored and
evaluated.

Investing in your neighborhood
The district is the place where people come together, organizing neighborhood parties, play or ideas
exchange. In the district we know each other and we trust the other. Therefore finds
sp.a a quality and challenging systems of public space close to each of us very
very important.

609.

sp.a focuses on the quality of our public space. It is our
common living area. Our public space meets the
needs of man and nature. We live in ever smaller living space. But
this we must compensate with more and better public lounge. We
foster new living and teaching methods such as shared gardens

145

common areas, housing parts, ... by informing about and
to remove any administrative barriers.
610.

Public space we organize tailored to your child. To this end we make existing
residential areas as much as possible and new residential areas by definition low-traffic and
we put up on trips on foot or by bike. This results in
room to play, play sports, hang out, learn cycling, pétanque, or
barbecue between the houses.

611.

Residential areas are designed so that even older people or people with
Guests can move freely. So we pay attention to
meeting places (from bench to speelpleintje), plenty of activities
walking distance (from catering to entertainment or leisure) and accessible
public transport. We distribute various forms of housing such as custom
housing (individual or group), service and social housing on the
district.

612.

sp.a believe very much added value of involving families in the
organization of the district. We create opportunities for productive self-organization in the
nearby, providing, together with the government maintains public space.

Time saving through involvement
Who avoids confrontation ends in court. The current planning culture of the Flemish
government creates unrest, no support. The public inquiry as an instrument of the 60s
you will no longer connect with the current zeitgeist, for arriving late and leaving no real dialogue
between interested parties increased. Prompted by a concern for their own safety or
Health Fleming organizes itself more than ever to protect and improve their own
environment. Each municipality 'long flowing "it sometimes seems. For sp.a is that commitment
no part of the problem, but just part of the solution. The challenge bestat So just in
existing social dynamic to use because she is a source of new, creative
and challenging ideas that improve the quality of our spatial projects. For who knows his
neighborhood or region better ... than those who are moving in every day?

613.

sp.a realizes real participation at the start of each spatial project. At that
moment are the objectives of a project fixed, but there is still
sufficient space for the formulation of alternative courses. Families,
business and society think so actively involved in the drafting of the
design of a spatial project.

614.

Real participation means a substantially different decision. This
assumes the form of co-production involving politicians, civil servants, private partners,
experts, families and civil society actively seek support through debate and
argumentation shared interest to build and formulate.

615.

The Flemish Government invests in essential skills such as professional
participatory management, where she has a particular focus on the
146

involvement of various groups in society. She needs these competencies
at the service of local authorities which are more suitable for processes
to facilitate co-production.
616.

Co-production do not need to start a political decision. Also privéinitiatiefnemers such as businesses or civil society organizations initiative
take. In that case the government takes a facilitating role. On that
way more informal processes for the involvement and
collaboration between stakeholders as possible. These result in a
note agreements between local government and local government over which launched
means an accelerated formal procedure (EIA, RUP and permits)

617.

Impact assessments
as
water keys,
match
reviews
environmental impact assessments need to effective commitments and resources
Leading the developer and / or government submitted before the license
becomes. Such suspension or annulment of projects such as the North-South connection
Limburg, the port of Antwerp, housing estates in flood-prone area or
the football stadium in Bruges show explicitly that impact assessments
such as water tests, appropriate assessments, environmental impact assessments are not pro
forma allowed to run.

618.

sp.a calls for adequate resources for local authorities on
authorization and restriction. This increased powers for local authorities
are the result of the introduction of the environmental permit. Only in this way
We ask local governments to judge quality and time savings
effectively realized. If the necessary funds are not provided threatens
increasing number of appeals.

619.

If after thorough participation at an early stage so conflicts
We avoid litigation than through a system of
conflict mediation. If, however lawsuits are filed, may
procedural errors which do not affect the end result of a project not
lead to an annulment or suspension of the project. Moreover, it should at the
balancing individual versus community interests the individual interest
not disproportionately dominate. That is why we provide a transparent,
clear and coherent framework.

Authorities work
Everything hangs together. Where we live determines how (easily) we moved. How we move
determines the amount of greenhouse gases we pump into the air. The amount of greenhouse gases in the air
determines how often and how severe it will overflow. Flooding Again determine where we
can live without worries. Decisions in one policy are never separate from one another
domain. That should keep the policy in mind, and therefore governments must work together.

620.

At the interface between land use, environment, nature, mobility and
live gets a true 'environmental policy' form which spatial development
147

Flemish regions at a less fragmented and therefore more integral way
approaches.
621.

The integration of the building permit and the environmental permit in a
environmental permit represents an important step to deliver projects on a more
assess integral way. She opens the possibility, for example.
sensitive mobility or energy issues to take as authorization basis. But
environmental policy continues. Also strategic vision documents, spatial
implementation plans and impact analyzes such as the environmental impact we fill
less sectoral and therefore more integral or area-in. Only in this way
can spatial projects at any stage of the development fully into account
consider the implications in terms of economic development,
health, mobility, the environment or nature.

622.

sp.a move actively to which the official project coordination of opinions
various departments in the context of authorization procedures within
integrates a set period to one advice.

623.

Integrated and strategic vision exercises like the policy area or
Flanders Mobility parallel come into being and focus on regions
Instead of Flanders. In this way, to leave the long term

626.

We put stronger in policy evaluation after project realization. We do
to learn from experience.

627.

We create a solutions-local cooperation in space
projects that transcend municipal boundaries. The province turns out to be
facilitator asking flexible partnerships (= projects
cooperation in other scale) between municipalities as equal partners
supports and guides.

4.6 Mobility: parts to go forward
Mobility brings us into motion, creates opportunities, provides meeting and takes people
under the church tower. That is important for us, because solidarity is better to fruition where
148

people can look beyond their own environment and interests. Mobility is effective, the motor of
our society and a wonderful tool to increase our freedom. That's why we spend
much attention to mobility.
But mobility as we know it today opens more and more in collective
immobility. Although we have the densest transport infrastructure throughout
Europe, we also have the biggest traffic jams in Europe: our Antwerp and Brussels
Files are sometimes longer than those in New York, London or Paris. Against the background of a further
exploding mobility in the coming years - because soon we are in Flanders by one million
more people - threatening the charges to be sticking to our current mobility so high that they
everyone separately threatened to smash. Of the ever growing traffic congestion, to
climate problem as a dark cloud hanging over us, to the fine dust that we daily
Inhalation: they have in common is that they threaten to cause much inequality, because it
the strong in our society will be who will be able to guard against much better. Our
current mobility is not only unsustainable, but also unjust.
However, if we look closely we see mobility opportunities. Cities and towns have discovered
a sustainable mobility policy is the engine for urban development. Carmakers have
gradually understood that oil will soon become so expensive that no one will still want
burn. Gradually hybrid cars have their place in the market. Major car manufacturers realize that the
Benefits of the car no longer apply at any time and at any place and see how
young people see a car less as a status symbol. Numerous car sharing systems arise in
several European cities like mushrooms from the ground. The wheel has itself with the electric
bike reinvented and everywhere was revived. Never before in our country so many names
people train, tram or bus. We are experienced in doing that we share through our our mobility
personal freedom may increase. And we feel that we ourselves become better more
sustainable mobility.
In the meantime, traffic congestion problems for many people, of course, a reality and not always
avoidable. Many more concrete is not a solution, only a combination of a different relationship
with mobility and a better and more efficient use of the existing infrastructure can anyone
ensure high quality mobility and therefore tackle congestion.
The mobility itself is clearly in motion and we must dare to respond much more.
Mobility is at a crossroads. And we must resolutely choose the exit to the new
mobility. A mobility that not only works better than today, safe and environmentally responsible
, but also fair and honest.
But how do we get there? The uniqueness of social democrats is always their intransigent pursuit
betterment been through cooperation. Mobility does not have to be different. Though it was
but because joint problems, you should also ask for joint solutions.

Mobility share increases our freedom

149

The new mobility starts with more and better public transport. There is still a long way off to
place to make something public transportation where we proudly and eagerly use them.
sp.a want it in the coming years again comes to the traveler. The different public
carriers must talk to each other, so that the current can be even better
be exploited and people smoothly from train to move over € bus. But the public
transport in the coming years may grow as well. sp.a therefore wants to reinvest more in
our public transport.

628.

To improve the quality of the public transport is an important
attention. With a new, more robust train timetable we improve
punctuality figures of the NMBS. For improving the flow of our
Buses and trams we roll out smart traffic lights at all intersections on our
regional roads. They give immediate priority to buses and trams and the increase
commercial rate. We also strongly encourage the flow measures
on local roads by their part-financing for a fund in Flanders
provided.

629.

Everyone is pedestrian. Steps lead on trial according to the STOP principle.
A proper pedestrian infrastructure is essential for road safety
and traffic viability. Moreover, the social and ecological importance may
not be underestimated. The management of the speed (eg. Zone 30), the
Eliminating literal and figurative barriers that pedestrians difficult
make interventions in infrastructure and spatial planning and more slow roads
take measures and a full policy, also above the local level.

630.

The various public transport companies (SNCB, De Lijn, STIB, TEC)
let their systems thinking behind them and work strongly oriented travelers. She
signs include a new method for monitoring the
punctuality, which is no longer the punctuality of the train, tram or bus
measured, but where now the traveler is the starting point. This new
measurement accuracy is a fair starting point for an improvement from the
Public transport companies and are leading to better agreements in the field
connections. Now displays in the trains travelers keep
informed of the exact arrival time of the train. There is also a real-time
projected information about transfer options in the approaching stations,
also for the connections with tram and bus.

631.

When buying new trains, account must be taken of the
Travellers wellbeing. They have to meet, for example, to the comfort
wheelchair users, such as restrooms.

632.

The closer cooperation between the public transport companies empties
at the latest by 2015 in the transport map; an electronic map showing
various types of tickets for various public
transport companies can be charged easily. We seize the advent of
transport the card in order to simplify the various tariff formulas and
better align. There will stay connected between the public
150

transport companies, because now provide significant price differences between bus and train
that travelers often do not make the most sustainable choices.
633.

Public transport companies act more in dialogue with major
stakeholders: cities and towns, travelers (organizations), Advisory,
research ... Cities and municipalities more binding participation
by changes in the supply or in decisions on investments, also on the
city ​​borders. Over the four public transport companies to move to
we are a travelers panel, from which the public transport companies
biennial can prioritize their work points.

634.

The current train schedule dates from 1998 and is therefore no longer
cohesive. That is why we want the SNCB composing a new transport plan.
This new transport plan is an opportunity to present the offer to train
remember, there to create more coherence and a clear hierarchy. The
new offer must start from an even distribution of the offering,
with for example a quarter frequency of the trains on the main
train axes. This new transport plan must be thoroughly up to three years
evaluated and adjusted if necessary.

635.

We disagree with a saving policy on public transport. We
again invest more in public transport and increase the supply further
off (as Spartacus, Brabantnet ...). Line also takes up its
potential studies to start from 2015 and based on the Wensnet her
Vision 2020 to further expand the offering. For sp.a it is further
expansion of the backbone of public transport in and around our cities
with new light rail, light rail vehicles and (regional) trams priority. After Brussels should
also get an integrated suburban network in Antwerp and Ghent with a solid
night offerings. New connecting and enabling regional lines we leave this in
the future more closely.

636.

sp.a wants the public transport companies to respond more strongly to the
leisure - and event traffic, which is becoming increasingly important as
displacement motive in our mobility. Also over the weekend, evening and night,
The public transport companies have an attractive offer
offer.

637.

We build the European high speed train network so that all
Capitals easily and quickly accessible. Prices should competitive
are priced from airplanes.

Mobility has many versions and variations. This wealth will sp.a full play. Because the focus
at shared mobility is availability and use of mobility modes instead of on property,
we get a much richer palette of mobility opportunities. Our mobility share more,
together we increase our freedom. No longer the vehicle is central, but the user. With the
Part-car to the parking lot of the station, as the train to the other side of the country and
from there to the electric bike sharing cover the last mile. In the future, this should happen at a
smooth, comfortable and easy way. Both planned and at the last minute. The new
151

Mobility must offer people the freedom at any time and according to their needs
well informed to choose a (shared) transport solution. The car can also be more so and
more suppliers are to other more sustainable forms of mobility and often faster.

638.

We are strongly committed to auto parts. Recently an umbrella organization for all was
Founded car sharing organizations, which bundles their interests and their
represents opposition to the public. We support this dome and its
Members stronger. The supply of auto parts will be further developed.

639.

Family owned auto parts, where people take the initiative to
auto part group to start by agreeing a contract to close, we make
for a solution to the insurance issues. We propose a BTWvrijstelling for revenue from auto parts. The hiring of the car
others constitutes an additional source of income. With the inclusion of
auto parts in the traffic laws we make the reservations pitches
for car sharing vehicles now also effectively enforceable.

640.

In Europe, we find several examples of smaller cities with popular
bike sharing systems: Avignon (90 000 inhabitants), Coburg (40,000 inhabitants) and Biel
(50,000 inhabitants). After the city of Antwerp also get other cities their own
bike share system. By 2020, a network of over Flanders
bike share points are deployed.

641.

We actively seek all kinds of partnerships between public and private actors,
with and between cities and municipalities, public transport companies and all kinds of
emerging providers of mobility services (Cambio, Zen Car, Bolides, Vélo,
Villo, the taxi industry, ...). We are looking for concrete synergies. Would be so
For example, shared taxis also can act as a supplement to the traditional
public transport, including the Brussels Collecto system.

642.

Public transport in response to the trend of shared mobility. On
the end of the legislature therefore provides not only the transport card access
to public transportation, but also to various other shared mobility and
mobility services: car sharing, bicycle, car parks, shared taxis, bike repairs
at bike points, mobility budget ... People who choose their
car number plate to deliver in a considerable mobility bonus get paid out
their transport card.

643.

Shared

Public
transport companies, the

mobility services exchange real-time information to inform travelers
their mobility opportunities - and options. They're open
philosophy own data so that application developers new applications
develop. We provide a hyper-intelligent route planning and responding to
the possibilities of crowdsourcing, in which people think about our
mobility and control her. Intelligent transport and - applications
make the shared mobility easier.
152

In the meantime we tackle congestion
So our mobility needs and can otherwise be a wise choice for the right vehicle for
each movement, is absolutely necessary. We therefore continue to engage in more shared mobility.
But meanwhile the congestion problem is of course a reality for many people because traffic jams are today
less and less avoidable. Flanders has a very dense network and our history
planning does not help either. Even more extra of concrete is, therefore, no solution; only one
combining a different approach to mobility and a better and more efficient use of the
existing infrastructure, anyone can guarantee high-quality mobility and hence also the files
approaches. We need to improve the flow in the short term, cut-through traffic approaches,
make sure that not everyone moves during rush hour and carry a good parking policy
cooperation with the municipalities.

644.

We encourage avoiding the rush hour. Following the introduction of road pricing
it becomes easier for trucks to trucks from the striker
hold. We will also focus on homework or work in satellite offices and
We give extra (financial) incentives for motorists to carpool, choosing
for other modes of transport or avoid the rush hours by car.

645.

Experiences with lanes are positive, both in Flanders and the Netherlands.
Where possible we implement new lanes to traffic flow
promote and tackle congestion oriented.

646.

Numerous files can be avoided by an appropriate rate regime. We
perform a dynamic system in which lowers the speed limit
depending on the crowds. This allows for a better flow and improved
utilization of existing capacity. Also on the Brussels ring road, the
top speed limited to 100 km / h.

647.

Lots files also result from accidents. In addition to its speed, many of these
Incidents also due to not very organized or unnecessary
weaving maneuvers and junctions. We therefore optimize existing
infrastructure by reducing weaving maneuvers and as safe as possible
expired. Now zippers is required, we put on awareness campaigns to
people make their own zippers.

648.

We also tackle the traffic diversion to. This is not only for local residents and
Local traffic necessary, it enables us to stop suction from
new cars. We adapt the infrastructure so that through traffic on the
road network must remain and only local traffic on local roads
can go.

649.

In our cities and towns sp.a allows for more efficient parking policy so that
The cars do not flood our city centers. Companies are also
153

responsibilized to work with for the transportation of their employees
between the place of employment in an industrial zone or in city center
and car parks outside the city, stations and other transport hubs. This
can order through the use of shuttle buses from car parks and from this
industrial zones and city centers, but also by bike pooling systems so that
various modes of transport can be combined optimally.
Safe traffic
Over the past ten years, lost more than 10 000 people living in our traffic. More than 69 000
people were seriously injured. And nearly 800,000 people experienced one of those victims. we walk
in our country is still twice as likely to die in traffic than in, for example Netherlands
or Britain. Therefore wants to put sp.a road safety high on the agenda. We embrace
up technological developments that can benefit our safety,
draw from the new Flemish safety instruments of the sixth state reform and
want a strong EU engagement.

650.

Every fatality is one too many. For sp.a the end goal remains a mobility
where we have no fatality more regrettable. We want
the existing Road Safety Plan in 2015 with all actors concerned
evaluated. Based on the evaluation comes a new, ambitious
Road Safety Plan. With this plan we want the number of fatalities in the short
halve term (by 2020).

651.

We reform the driver training and inspiration from the project 'Start to Drive'.
There will be a mandatory basic training for each candidate driver and his or
its free companion. By nominee directors for them to gain more experience
free under supervision training is experience-oriented. There comes a
specific curriculum for driver training. This must be, among other things lead to
training and examinations, be better aligned.

652.

For nearly 25 years, is spoken in our country about the driving license with points. A
operational, central database of traffic offenses should therefore quickly there
come. The driving license with points should lead to a more rigorous and firm approach
recidivism. The demerit points can also be rewarding. Thus motorists
their points increase by example to follow a refresher course (an anti-skid course,
a course in defensive driving, or eco-driving, ...).

653.

We want more enforcement and increase the chance of getting caught. One must annually
Three drivers are checked for speed, alcohol and seat belt use. For
speed traps we make more use of fixed and mobile speed checks,
both region - as local roads. The funds from the road fund
we divide based on the efforts of police. The number of
trucks involved in accidents with heavy casualties in percentage higher
than ordinary cars. To reduce this, we must ban on overtaking for
trucks to maintain better.

154

654.

Awareness and enforcement go hand in hand. We use even more the
testimonies of road victims as prevention tool in secondary
and higher education. A bicycle brigade does all our elementary schools.

655.

Vehicle technology is important for road safety. EU accelerates
its policy on intelligent transportation systems (ITS), focusing on the
technologies that have the most impact on road safety. Against at
last in 2020 makes a 'semi-open' Intelligent Speed ​​Assistant (ISA) part of
European legal vehicle requirements for cars.

656.

We encourage far-reaching European safety for trucks.
Trucks with a shorter, more rounded nose so that the blind spots around the
reduce cabin, are just a first step.

657.

In 2002 sp.a stated commitment lead to dangerous 800, Black
intersections to eliminate. At those points, the number of dropped
injury crashes by at least a quarter. We use the latest black
points out as soon as possible and set a new program for 400 new
dark gray intersections. This approach is however in line with the
European directive on the management of road safety
road infrastructure. We also invest in the safety of railway crossings,
including through the targeted elimination of level crossings by constructing
replacement infrastructure.

658.

The biennial existing and report the condition of the roads' brings
from 2015 the state of our paths precisely. With such a

the
investment programs. We reform the Reporting Cycle tracks. There comes a
application for mobile devices where cyclists can park their bike paths along
assess and identify bottlenecks (crowdsourcing).

659.

Our infrastructure is to improve innovation. We are talking about
green waves, smart traffic lights and dynamic traffic. We
establish an innovative and ambitious pilot project on 'the way of the
future'. The aim is to experiment with all kinds of new technology (ICT) security techniques (including the flow) of traffic
improve. The experience gained from the pilot project we will later take to
(re) construction of our roads.

660.

We improve the safety of the transport of dangerous goods for
complete logistics network. We therefore put risk standards - criteria
instruments to the risks of transporting dangerous substances
calculate and evaluate. By analogy with the Netherlands, we investigate
opportunity to draw up a basic network transport hazardous substances, "and this
for all transport modes (including pipelines).

155

Sustainable mobility
Not only because of our high traffic safety and our long traffic jams is our little mobility
durable. Nearly 20 percent of greenhouse gas emissions caused by our
mobility. Our children and the elderly choke, unfortunately sometimes almost literally, in the fine dust, because
Flanders is one of the European hotspots in terms of fine dust. Increasing odor - and
noise pollution make our environment less and less attractive. However, we no longer want
depart from the cut-throat corporate problem, or from the appealing challenge. We push
Therefore, the door to technological innovations, which now long ajar state, and finally open
concerted focus on electro-mobility. These electro-mobility to our ambitions in terms of
greenhouse gas - and reducing particulates and quieter mobility fulfill simultaneously. Resolutely, but
at the same time step by step. Because after 2050 we all drive electric. In the meantime, we will also
need to focus on other, more sustainable propulsion technologies and greener transportation fuels
(natural gas, biofuels of the second generation and sustainably produced hydrogen). Independently of
the technological innovations we can work with all kinds of concrete initiatives, our
sustainable mobility further. The new mobility we accept in any case no longer
that mobility costs impose a mortgage the future of our (grand) children.

Sustainable commuting
661.

There will be a social mobility pact between the government, unions and employers. The
government is taking the first step with a new Commuter plan. From 2015,
transport plans compulsory for companies and establishments with more than 100
employees. Governments, employers and trade unions commit to concrete
objectives and projects sustainable mobility and / or more virtual
mobility (including telework), working in the hand. This compares to a
helping government which, as in the Netherlands, reaches mobility vouchers. These are
vouchers which the company can temporarily hire a mobility consultant.

662.

The budget of the Flemish government, empowering subsidies to employers
take measures to stimulate their sustainable commuting is
doubled. It is better to ensure that the submitted projects effectively
lead to more sustainable mobility.

663.

The existing commuter tax system is complex and not very coherent. With the
mobility budget, we ensure that employees in consultation with
Employers can more easily compile their own mobiliteitsmix. Us
Mobility policy is based on a high-quality and full public
transport network. We are guided by the favorable (para) tax treatment of
sustainable transport in the mobility budget, employees and
employers in the direction of more use of the public transport. We
greening the taxation of company cars. Because the company today
is considered part of the wage, we highlight
protection of purchasing power, when greening would be accompanied by
a phasing out of the use of company cars.

156

Healthier traffic
664.

The maintenance of low emission zones (LEZ) is costly and threatens only
limited generation effect by supranational air pollution. Therefore choose
we prefer more pedestrian - and car-free city centers and villages, by
more car parks for visitors to put more and better public transport
organize and deploy on shared mobility (car-sharing, bicycle sharing,
shared taxis, ...).

665.

We build in every city center, minimum two true mobility hubs or
mobility hubs off. One of them is located at the station. We also build the
network of cycle points out. There will be more transfer parking (park and rides) to the
outskirts of our major cities and other mobility nodes. Moving from
the one to the other means of transport can be an easy and
approachable way. As the car is more supplier to another
forms of mobility.

666.

In order to create the support for less society which is auto-focused
We now organize in any season even one car-free weekend in our city -
and village centers.

667.

Many of our trips are shorter than 5 km. Yet we often take for that
yet the car. There is still huge potential open for the (electric) bike. The
bicycle must finally get the place he truly deserves. Therefore, we aim
to 500 kilometers of additional bike paths and bicycle streets per year in places
where no paths can be constructed. Equally crucial is the permanent
maintenance of existing trails. In each province there are also at least
5 new fietsostrades (bicycle highways). They are the backbone of the
above local functional cycle route network and bring the rider quickly, safely and
comfortable to his or her destination. Finally, we advocate that as many
intersections possible to provide road signs B22 and B23, which allow that
Cyclists are allowed to drive through the red as they turn right. This should be the rule
be, rather than the exception.

668.

To give the bike an extra boost we reduce VAT on the
purchase of (electric) bikes from 21 to 6 percent.

669.

Bicycle theft is unacceptable. It is a fitting bike registration
worked to discourage theft and healing and selling
combat stolen bicycles.

From natural gas to electric mobility
670.

The tax on the entry (BIV) was reformed in 2012 to people
purchase to steer towards an environmentally friendly car. The next step is to
reform of the existing annual road tax based on the CO²uitstoot and Euro standard. We want the greened traffic load also
equity component contains one would be introduced gradually. For already
157

car registration, the existing traffic load, based on fiscal HP
applicable. So we prevent people abruptly confronted
with an increase in their annual road tax without incurring
could adjust their buying behavior.
671.

We also make sure that people also get the chance to effectively
less polluting cars to buy. We seize the planned review in 2015
European regulation setting emission performance standards for new
cars to further tighten the standards after 2020. 2025
We strive for a standard of 60 g CO2 / km. We extinguish the so-called
super appropriations, additional electric vehicles weigh heavily on the
calculation of the average, from. From 2016 we also want to CO2 standard
for heavy trucks. By 2020, new heavy trucks
at least 20 percent more efficient.

672.

We continue along the road to becoming stricter EURO standards, emission requirements for new vehicles in areas including PM10 (particulate
dust) and NOx (nitrogen oxides). Since January 1, 2011, the particulate filter is already mandatory for
New diesel cars. We also want to older diesel cars (EURO 1-4) this
particulate filters require and advocate a change in the European standard with
regarding the technical requirements for vehicles. Each owner of an older
diesel car that allows installation of a retrofit filter is entitled to a premium.

673.

Today, too much tampering with the test cycles to drive a greener image to
give. Europe must create a crystal clear regulations for the
test procedures for cars. The official tests, the circumstances of the
normal use of mimicking a car. We demand an "in service testing '
whereby samples are taken in real conditions. If it appears that the
difference with the testing of the manufacturers with more than 4 per cent amounts are
manufacturers fined.

674.

We are preparing the way for the electro-mobility and direct analogy with
the Dutch Formula E-team a task force with the industry, providing a
ambassadors - and pioneering plays in the field of electrical
mobility. Actions from the industry and actions by the government are in the
bosom of this task force coordinated.

675.

We rest park and ride car parks and station car parks gradually with
charging infrastructure for electric cars, electric scooters and electric
bicycles. Thus, the multimodal hubs where people can easily
change of transport. Elsewhere we build the charging infrastructure.
By the end of the legislature we have in Belgium at least 12,000
public charging points for electric vehicles.

676.

The government sets a good example and greening its own fleet. From 2015
the Flemish, federal and European government buys only have low emission cars
(these cars have an eco score of 72 or more). The public
transport companies source only hybrid buses as switching to
158

zero-emission vehicles. We do so adopt more stringent requirements in the decision
the Flemish Government on the regular service. With an adjustment of
the taxi decision, finally, we also strive for more environmentally friendly taxi services.
You have the right to mobility
It is sp.a too sensitive in the genes for social inequality. In the division between old and
New social issues is mobility to communicate clearly at last. Mobility policy should not
Firstly, to combat poverty, or to increase the opportunity for personal development.
The right to mobility seems to many people today are more or less acquired, but there is still
many transport poverty and inequality transport. For many households, a car priceless.
Against the background of a further exploding mobility and increasing competition for
scarce resources and space we need to ensure that the most vulnerable groups in the
would draw short straw. Also in the new mobility mobility remains a social good.

677.

In addition to a problem of too much mobility, there is also a problem of too little
mobility. Many people have and will continue to depend in the future
public transport, both in our cities and in a less urbanized
environment. We therefore maintain the decree on basic mobility. A
noble policy principle as basic mobility, however, can no longer do without it
formulate clearer choices about where we are in the Flanders of tomorrow
will live, work or relax. The offer can be ensured through
public transportation, but also through targeted measures such as
For example, taxi vouchers, cycling and car sharing systems.

678.

We place since 2016 also a basic mobility on the transport map. With
this basic mobility everyone can sample the range of
mobility opportunities which it (over time) access: train, tram, bus,
bike - and car sharing systems, taxis, ... Via third party payer systems (cities and
municipalities, employers, businesses and organizations), the basic package can be
expanded. Social tariffs or other discounts to which people are entitled -
For example, because of their status (orphan, disabled persons) or their
low income - are granted automatically, with or without MOBIB card.

679.

A major concern remains the accessibility of both public
transport and the stair tread and exit locations. For young, old, less mobile or mobile.
The ambition is that the public transport in the long term no one can exclude and
that everyone use without additional literal or figurative obstacles can
make. Only if public transport is fully accessible practice
where people with disabilities are 24 hours in advance to notify,
stop. We present concrete and ambitious commitments firmly in the
management agreements. In addition, the carriage door to door must continue
be developed for that group for which no regular public transport
is an option. The NMBS should it be possible that in between train trips
operated stations no reservation is needed. Line must communicate

159

their access offerings (some accessible buses, accessible stops)
coupled with clear roadmaps and updates.
680.

Some insurers refuse today resolutely certain incipient
drivers to give car insurance or count them exorbitant rates
to. sp.a wants three - or five-year contracts at a controlled rate so
risks can be spread. We also want, as already exists for
telephony - and energy prices, a website where prices can easily together
are compared. The reform of driver training must for everyone
remain affordable. Older drivers are facing high
insurance amount. Also there will sp.a contracts with controlled price.

681.

sp.a want free public transport for over-65s retained. The government must
can permanently weigh on the pricing policy of the public
transport companies.

Logistics cooperation for efficient mobility
682.

Also in the logistics sector pays collaboration. sp.a want better odds on
intensive cooperation in our logistics networks. The sharing of information
allows goods flows are bundled profitable. We
Therefore, install an open, common IT platform of government and
industry open standards that seamless exchange of information between
batches makes possible. It allows to optimize the logistics process
allowing higher quality, greater durability and lower cost
be realized. Smart logistics requires a clever use of existing
infrastructure (road, rail, inland estuary shipping and coastal shipping). Therefore
a powerful combination of goods flows, judicious siting of
multimodal freight terminals, a solid mobility and
smart road charging for lorries more than necessary. Sustainable logistics
also requires a sustainable infrastructure. Therefore there is also wise
be invested in the railways, inland waterways and ports as multimodal
nodes.

683.

We build our ports further sustainable logistic hubs which involve
succeed to add increasing value to the flow of goods and
better lashing a wider range of profitable rail and
barge shuttles managed to put on to the hinterland. This also is
The freight network is completed by a port railway line between Ghent and
Antwerp, a second freight access to the Port of Antwerp
impregnation of a freight railway line 11 to the Netherlands. The port authorities
thereby exploiting the port area as a public good with attention to a
economical use of space, a shift of freight to rail and inland waterways,
maintaining the existing natural values, the use of residual heat
and renewable energy and providing shore power and alternative
fuels (CNG, LNG) for reducing emissions from
shipping. In this way, the port authorities to help to manage the mobility
and to ensure the viability of the neighboring towns and villages.
160

684.

We propose a master plan for seamless information in logistics
to achieve system, which includes, inter alia, a concrete
allocation of responsibilities. Besides anchoring, parts and upgrades
knowledge and innovation in the freight we continued on the
Strengthening transfer points and multimodality.

685.

More logistic cooperation, however, also calls first to a fairer level
playing field in the transport of goods in terms of social, safety - and
competition regulation, the provision of sustainable transport infrastructure and
the consequent internalization of all infrastructure - and external costs
caused by freight transport. A first important step is to do so,
at the very latest by the end of 2016, the introduction of an intelligent mileage tax
light (3.5 ton to 12 ton MTM MTM) and heavy cargo (12 tons MTM and more).
The use of the truck is today too cheap and should, overall,
so expensive. During rush hour and in congested areas, a higher
kilometer rate. Rates also vary depending on the environmental impact of the
truck. The proceeds of road pricing go to investments in
sustainable transport and this for all forms of transport.

686.

We realize in all our 13 cities with a smarter and more sustainable
organization of the supply, by, among other city distribution centers. We
give the 13 cities with financial support for the preparation of their own
provisioning profile and at the same time laying the foundation for a Flemish
urban distribution database. We subscribe to the forthcoming European
research programs to further the knowledge on urban distribution to
sharpen and support promising initiatives in the field. This results, appearance
by 2016 in an ambitious political vision of the Flemish government on urban
distribution which a practical framework guidelines attached. From the
city ​​distribution, we also put beside electric delivery bicycle couriers
in.

687.

Thanks to the city distribution trucks have not just more everywhere
to rumble through our streets. The Flemish 'freight routes' is
more than just a "designated route. We want the freight route network
directed is monitored by cameras with number plate recognition. We
study or can oversee the smart road pricing for freight after 2017
compliance.

4.7 Working together for a safe environment
Safety is a basic right. We start from the perspective that security is becoming an integral
approach. So paying attention to both prevention and for consistent performance
enforcement and qualitative follow-up. To guarantee this, everyone should effectively and efficiently
cooperation with all agencies and organizations involved in the issue. The
then goes initially to the police, prosecutors, courts and all
agencies involved in enforcing sentences, but also about the cooperation with the
assistance to victims and the authorities responsible for the supervision and treatment
161

of offenders. A result-oriented cooperation requires clear agreements. Therefore for sp.a
clear priorities and measurable objectives, clear responsibilities and strict monitoring and
control naturally within the entire justice policy. Only then can we all safe
ensure environment.

We make combating violent crimes and burglaries our priority
Violent Crime and burglaries have a very negative impact on the security feeling
of people. It is therefore logical that we fight these criminal phenomena our
making priority.

688.

sp.a responsabiliseert all security actors to continue working with measurable
objectives. Thus the National Security sets clear priorities
be translated into concrete and achievable objectives. It's clear who
responsible for the realization of these objectives, and how the
Progress is monitored on the matter. sp.a is focusing on violent crime
burglaries.

689.

Violent Crime almost always have a dramatic impact on the
sense of security, not only victims but also from others who are in their
environment face. So worried violence - whether it be
robbery with violence, sexual violence, family violence, violence against young people
in nightlife or violence against gay people is - far more people than the
actual casualties strong feelings of insecurity. sp.a realizes
substantial decrease in the number of cases of violence and a substantial increase
the number of violent crimes solved and punished.

690.

Sexual violence and sexual abuse undermine confidence in the
society. They are also common forms of violence still
often not reported to the court. sp.a therefore calls for better
help for victims of sexual violence or sexual abuse. We acknowledge
'reference centers sexual violence' where simultaneously the acute care to the
victim be administered initiated treatment (incl.
psychological and psychosocial support) and collected evidence
becomes.

691.

We recognize trust centers for adult victims of
partner violence and sexual violence or abuse where victims can contact
and be assisted by the decisions they take as a victim
to be confronted.

692.

We review the cooperation agreements offender support. We take
thereby the residential care of perpetrators of sexual violence or abuse.
At present, the residential customers with an insufficiently large, so
exactly the most dangerous offenders at the end or after their sentence inadequate
be adequately monitored.
162

693.

Also, violence has an adverse impact on the wellbeing of
victims. Moreover, children appear even when they are 'only' witness
of family violence as highly detrimental to suffer. The battle
against family violence remains sp.a therefore a priority. The legal
possibility of a perpetrator of domestic violence temporarily immediately after the facts
access to prohibit the house, in that context is a very important way.
sp.a works any bottlenecks in the application of the law on temporary
outplacement way so that this instrument was used optimally in the struggle
against family violence. Further innovative projects are addressing
family violence, such as the Protocol of Courage or CO3, evaluated with a view to
an enhanced approach to family violence across Flanders. The bottlenecks
which arise in this context in terms of the cooperation between police,
justice and social workers in the broadest sense of the word, we eliminate.

694.

One of the most common phenomena continue to the crime
burglaries. Not only is there the attack on the property and the right
privacy, it is not disputed that the sense of security given a serious blow by
these crimes. sp.a move with a host of measures, contained in a
Action burglaries, on burglary and consistent enforcement. So
we continue to invest in good lighting in public spaces and encourage
placing antiemetic locks on doors and windows. The tit-for-tat policy
with respect to shape by, for example, thieves we provide the use of
cameras for custody for thieves who are caught red-handed and by
the use of summary justice.

695.

sp.a wants a healthy balance between initiatives that create safety and
respect for privacy and the privacy. The use of
CCTV should therefore strictly regulated and actively monitored to
be and should serve only in terms of security objectives
to realize.

696.

sp.a wants more effective action against itinerant and / or cross border
criminal groups which, with or without violence, commit burglaries. Specifically
to combat this type of crime we put cameras on the system
automatic license plate recognition, and we operate at European level
Preventive cooperation plan.

Society we solve problems together
Society Problems such as illegal dumping, road rage, noise nuisance and vandalism should
be taken seriously and are handled. The public space belongs to everyone, and
everyone must take good care of what we share. Initially we speak people
as much as possible on their nuisance behavior through neighborhood mediators, social workers,
community guards and local police officers. When obstinate behavior the police should do their job and
sanctions must be implemented. We provide a well-functioning justice system
so that the backlog is eliminated and which is followed up

163

determinations by the police of nuisance behavior. Children playing, however, can not simply as
nuisance be considered.

A thorough reform of our criminal procedure
For years ending procedures also too often lead to impunity,
undermine confidence in the judiciary. Therefore, there is urgent need for a fundamental
reform of our criminal procedure. To have real impact, we take the one hand
phase of the research and on the other hand we get rid of the endless
procedure options within the procedure.

697.

We abolish the figure of the examining magistrate. Following the overwhelming
majority of the EU countries we keep on this way, only one single
kind of research, namely those conducted by the Public Prosecutor.
We ensure that the fundamental rights and freedoms are monitored
by a judge of freedoms and the increasing involvement of the
lawyer, so we immediately also cater to our European
obligations.

698.

Even after the court verdict, we simplify the procedure. So
we procure the opposition procedure, whereby someone for the first time just does not
case for the treatment of her or his case, occasionally, except in cases
force majeure.

An efficient police
The police are usually the first link in the entire security chain. When this first
link ineffective or is efficient, fails the security at the earliest inception.

699.

sp.a defines logical and larger police off within the new larger
arrondissements, which are optimally suited to the local level. This is to
to ensure better and more efficient services. Interzonal and
Cross-border cooperation should be intensified. The reform
and optimization of the federal police will be further implemented and evaluated.
We seek simple structures where there are more police officers
actually deployed in the field.

700.

We continue in the district police and increase the accessibility and
visibility of the police officers with more to run the bike.

701.

A more efficient organization of government in Brussels must also translate
to improve police functioning for citizens and more results on the ground. The
164

significant additional resources Brussels receives annually need short
term lead to more qualitative police work (for example in terms of the
reception and victim support) and more ping catch in the act, a
higher degree of clearing, etc.
702.

The police should ensure that any police officer who has contact with the
public has been trained in human rights and can handle
crime towards LGBT people.

A judicial reform that makes the difference
Judicial reform should start really in the next legislature and on the ground
to be effectively implemented. Its success must be truly felt by the
people.

703.

Strict monitoring of the judicial reform is a priority for sp.a
For the next Minister of Justice who also achievable and measurable
objectives must be agreed with the players in the field. All actors
are involved in designing and / or implementing the security policy
must realize that the resources are limited, that priorities be set
and that account must be taken over the management of those funds.

A just and humane sentencing
It is critical that it continues to address the problem of overcrowding in our prisons
becomes. We operate the projects that the prison capacity expanded off. Numerous
Other measures are necessary for a dignified and result-oriented sanctioning
convicts and detainees. Since the sentencing begins a new period in which the
return to society of an individual - with a few exceptions against whom society
should be permanently protected people too - being actively prepared.

704.

There is a need for a coherent and sustainable policy vision, which contributes to a
quality punishment and sentencing policy with clear guidelines in terms
of criminal procedure and sentencing. sp.a therefore launching a broad
social and parliamentary debate on the punishment and sentencing policy
which leads to an orientation note. sp.a This is based on the idea that the
spiral of always wanting more and heavier punishment is counterproductive:
prison capacity is very expensive and jail complicate the social
reintegration. We examine whether and how smaller detention houses may have a role
play in our detention model. Furthermore, attention should not only be there for the
deprivation of liberty, but also for the execution of all types
capital punishment. The percentage of effective recovery of the
pronounced fines and confiscations go up dramatically.

165

705.

The Prosecution today not familiar with the sentence.
The possibilities in terms of the execution of sentences and fines for research
other patrimonial penalties and the diversity of delivery mechanisms
custodial penalties (electronic monitoring, community service, autonomic
probation sentence, conditional release ...) are great. Therefore choose sp.a
for a sentencing judge to any entity of the Public Ministry
which, within the framework of national guidelines, an actual
sentencing policies affect. The magistrate must especially compliance with a
ensure real implementation of penalties through better communication
Finances, the justice centers that are to the communities
transferred, with prisons, etc.

706.

Belgium lags behind greatly in terms of the possibilities for forensic
expertise. Each day included in the regular psychiatry Individuals
observation. For persons with a much more complex problem because of the
combination of a psychiatric disorder with committing a crime
this possibility does not exist in Belgium. Judges must therefore about
course of life decisions based on often dubious expertise.
sp.a therefore is working on the establishment of the prison research and
Clinical Observation Centre, as already decided in 1999. We carry a
Master's degree in forensic psychiatry.

707.

More than 1,100 inmates are in prison because there is no place in
psychiatric institutions. For many it means a life imprisonment,
in oblivion of justice, where they lack any concern and perspective.
Belgium is for this inhumane system already condemned repeatedly. The current
system needs urgent reform. sp.a therefore wants in the first place
a new law comes on the internment. In addition, more resources
be released to the care of internees. The Forensic
Psychiatric centers in Ghent and Antwerp are the first care centers. The
care, treatment and reintegration of mentally vulnerable person is
central. We make binding agreements between Justice, Health,
communities and the private healthcare sector on enlargement and the
Optimizing the network of care for internees.

708.

The need for care is in the cell walls not less than outside, on the contrary. And
since most prisoners return to society, has
Health a clear responsibility here. We investigate
Therefore, the conditions under which prisoners and internees a
full status can get into the compulsory health insurance, so they
may exercise the same rights as insured in free
society.

709.

The training and supervision of prison guards should be better. New guards are today
insufficiently prepared for the reality of working in a
prison environment. In addition, there must be, besides their safety,
also be paid to the social, psychosocial and intercultural aspects of the
Job.
166

710.

The current state of the prison system requires a strong and
independent oversight. The Central Supervisory Council for Prisons and the
oversight committees have sufficient resources and support to their
perform duties in an independent and adequately. sp.a wants a
inmate complaints right to exercise real.

Rapid assistance in case of emergency
Every citizen has the right to appropriate and rapid assistance in an emergency or disaster. The fire,
Civil Defence and the 112-centers should operate as modern organizations and fast
efficiently provide appropriate assistance to the people who need their help.

711.

The agency which 112 deposit must stand for the daily effective
cooperation and dedication of the emergency in time of need after years of
virtual existence finally really created so that it can be task
recording.

712.

We harmonize the basic standards for fire prevention through a constructive
consultation with the regions and communities. The cities and towns
be better supported in the preparation of emergency and intervention plans
are supported through the federal Knowledge of Civil
Safety.

713.

We are building a system that allows deaf, hard of hearing and people with
speech impairments can reach the emergency call response centers via SMS.

714.

Volunteers within the corps also get after the reform a full
place in the corps, with plenty of career opportunities. To
encourage volunteering at the fire department, firemen and women candidate can (partially) undergo during their working hours courses.

5 SUPPORTIVE CARE: THE WELL HAVE NOW AND LATER
1.5 Together for your health and well-being
Health care, but also the Flemish welfare, are among the foundations of our
social protection. Health risks bear together, care record together, it makes every day
the difference. The difference between health for those who can afford it or for health
everybody. The difference between a solitary and a dignified old age.
Nevertheless, the challenges for social welfare and health care are enormous. The demand for more and
better health care continues to increase. This puts pressure on the government budget. Furthermore pay
we up to a quarter of our care yourself. For some remains (part of) essential care
therefore difficult to reach. We will have to continue investing in our care and they also better
should organize. Among other healthcare providers to better work together, we can
the concern is not only more efficient but also more accessible organization. Because everyone besides,
including involving the patient, we can in terms of quality to the absolute world
evolve.
Welfare and care are part of the backbone of our society. For sp.a must
decisions about the approach and use of the funds closer to the people on the ground
are being brought. Both the caregivers as for the dependents. Less administrative
delay, more socialization. The following proposal applies very broadly for welfare and
care. From youth to approaches for chronic diseases, to the elderly, the people policy
with disabilities and much more.
In recent years, especially decisions grafted onto what already exists. Especially in the
Flemish level is not a sufficient answer revealed to the existing challenges. Indeed,
it even has never had that ambition. Which is a shame. Because it often comes down to is that
Waiting lists are not addressed. That people do not get proper care, help or support at the
when they are most in need. A problem that arises in large
compartments of the welfare and health sector.
Because many of our health systems are full, we constantly intervene to adjustments or
alternatives. Too few possible solutions to the problem itself. It not only leads to
many people do not sit in the right place and not appropriate helped. It also leads to
some people who might be better not get this chance. In the youth, in the
mental health, in people with a disability ... that's poignantly clear.
Sp.a need for a less stiff method in determining the demand for care and less
heavy and lengthy administrative process lead to an appropriate package of care
offered without dependents end up on a waiting list. The
health care provider may choose more broadly for the most appropriate solution for the specific context
where the need for care arises. Decompartmentalise care sectors, care coordination and

168

care plans are drawn many times as honorable goals, but closer to these objectives

5.2 A supportive healthcare
Nothing is more important in life than good health. Our supportive care offers
many that security. And a good thing too, because together we spend there 10.5 percent of our annual
wealth (our GDP) to. A quarter of them we pay out of pocket.
What is striking when compared with other countries, is working together. Americans and
Dutch must respectively 17.6 percent and 12 percent a lot deeper into their pockets
grope, but are not necessarily better off. As 40 million Americans are uninsured, and the
coverage and freedom of choice limited to the weakest in the Netherlands. Only by caring together
organizing remains a life of health attainable for all of us. Not just those who 4000
euro for childbirth or 20,000 euros for a pacemaker may cough, but everyone
deserves world-class care. By working together we can make this possible. Yet our
health care for some challenges. We can not ignore. To keep up, we will

this will inevitably spend more in the coming decades our health. The
Planning Office shows the total expenditure on health in 2030 already to rise to 12.5 percent of GDP.
Does this mean that we can not invest in the future in the elderly? Or in terminally
sick? Absolutely not. For a society that itself judge plays in health issues
we fit. What this does mean is that we must continue to invest in health care and more than ever
must rationally handling funds that we have. Due to this even better to use
we can maintain our solidarity and concern continue to strengthen.
A second challenge presents itself in the persistent health gap. A poorly educated woman
today 18 healthy years to less well than a highly qualified colleague. This is
unacceptable. We are committed to the elimination of social and financial barriers and a
improved coverage of the compulsory insurance. Moreover, we put an end to the
commercialization of concern.
Finally, satisfaction should not lead to complacency. Also in terms of quality, we must
striving for excellence. That's why we go to a professionalization of the quality in
health care and we give the patient a voice in this.

We finance your health together
Everyone is entitled to care world. Health is not a privilege of those who for example
for a birth or a pacemaker or 4000 or 20,000 euro itself can bring to the table.
Nor of those who are fortunate that they are privately insured. Therefore, we choose a
solidary health care, in which everyone participates. That means indeed that athletes
help pay for smokers. But it means as well that "couch potatoes" help pay for the
stress fractures of recreational runners, soccer players for tennis elbow, childless couples for the
maternity, healthy people to people with cancer and so on. Each of us can
have adversity. Risks individualize comes down to the burden of bad luck in the
health lottery. Precisely because of our collective welfare and for the widest possible
spectrum of (health) financing risks, we avoid.
Private insurance policies offer no solution. Not only do they people, 40 percent of the
Belgians do not have private insurance, they are also extremely inefficient. For each euro in the
Private insurance is only 73 cents to make. The rest is lost in administration and
advertising costs and profits for the insurer. Mandatory insurance scores much better, there
goes from 95 euro cents to each concern.

Organize care efficiently is good for our health
We are living longer and can medically increasing. The demand for care therefore takes
inevitably. That is a clever creation. Nevertheless presents us with a challenge.
How do we pay for all this? And how do we foresee the growth margin of our ever improving care needed

Joint funding should reward health care and quality:

in one fell swoop.

The financing of our health care is all about your health.
That's why we get rid of the too pronounced emphasis on
performance medicine that works in hand over consumption. The feeding of
unnecessary, or even harmful tests or treatments may not

In the first line, especially in chronic care situations, we often want the flat-rate system

Without care thresholds everyone with it
A woman without a degree have 18 healthy years to less well than a woman with a
university degree. 13.7 percent of Belgians say they postpone care for financial reasons. That
not surprising when you know that hearing the personal contributions in Belgium among the highest in Europe.
Financial and social barriers remain so ensure health division in our
society. In addition, some issues remain to be little or not reimbursed by the compulsory
insurance. So they remain reserved for those who can afford it.

replace it with a fairer and more transparent funding, which is quality
rather than stimulates quantity. Everyone is always in a health care provider

Together increase the quality of care
Belgians are very satisfied with their health care. Accessibility plays an important herein
role. In the same breath, we often assume that we also in terms of quality among the world.
If we want to make that claim hard, we have to take a long way. To
support for, and to ensure the satisfaction of our healthcare system, we need quality

3.5 Mental health care for those who have additional needs
The impact of mental illness on individuals and society can not be underestimated. One in
four Belgians ever faced in his life with serious psychological problems.
Socialist Party stands for a mental health patient puts centrally and all people
reaches that have a need for. In addition, we give actors in the field, the trust and
responsibility for providing patients with a continuous and adequate care process. To
underlie this greater collaboration between services, raising awareness through the media,
more insights into the expectations of the patient and more participation of the patient in the
care planning.

Many regions have set up mobile multidisciplinary teams in recent years that provide
outpatient counseling, treatment and psychosocial rehabilitation of persons with mental
problems at their home or wherever they are located. The emphasis is on prevention,
early detection and early intervention. Ahead lies the challenge for the future in line
these are: the development of a community-based and integrated mental
health care, through the realization of care networks where both outpatient and residential
facilities together.
sp.a chooses the socialization of mental health care. This implies that one
works from a vision of integration, not only from a health and healing model. We
be patient in order to maintain themselves in their social environment and its problems
limitations. This only has a good chance of success if a broad policy level along in the bath
177

is drawn: poverty alleviation, local social policy, employment, diversity policies across the
society, education and housing.

759.

The focus of the treatment of mental illness lies with the
social environment and home context of the patient.

Internationally, the OECD estimates that 80 percent of people who need mental health
Assistance received no care. In severe disorders receive only half of the
people care. Belgium is doing only slightly better than the average. The use of psychotropic drugs,
drugs that act on the psychological well-being, is with us again remarkably high
Compared with other countries.

760.

We improve the referral to mental health services through a
wide network of organizations working together to develop psychic
vulnerable point the way: the general welfare,
primary care, home care, the police and the judiciary (eg. in addiction)
child welfare, and so on.

761.

sp.a strives simultaneously to a significant reduction in the prescription and
the use of psychotropic drugs. The use of drugs must be limited
are the cases where this is evident medically appropriate.

Many people with mental health problems benefit from psychological counseling as first aid,
without there being a necessity to start long-term psychotherapy. Currently, in
Flanders pilot projects already underway.

762.

Persons who have it need to be able to rely on
Primary psychological care. It must affordability and quality
are guaranteed. The primary care psychologist works closely with the GP.

The start-up of professional care now often comes too late; thus patients have an
increased risk of the need for a life-long treatment. This incidentally also applies if the
assistance too long winded.

763.

We will make early detection and early intervention important work for agents
community mental health. Early intervention we strengthen
priority the carrying capacity of the user as well as the people it
together. As a rule, we are building again after a few months off the aid.

After Japan Belgium has the highest number of psychiatric beds in the world. Residential Lots
Patients are not the best treatment site, as their care needs also ambulant
can be completed. Long-term recording in psychiatry limits the chances of (re)
to participate fully in society. Flanders has a longer length of stay
(average 69 days) in psychiatric services than the international average.
178

764.

We are working on a better quality of life for the patient, with fewer and
shorter hospitalizations. In the case of a recording work ambulatory care
and providers of residential facility together with a program for
a smooth reintegration. Other players on the field, such as GPs,
home care, social workers, employment counselors, are ...
actively engaged.

765.

We give an important place to ambulatory teams in psychiatry which
patients in their home environment and catch a support network around the
develop patient. The outpatient teams to work towards an optimal
accessibility. Parallel with this is a contemplated reduction in psychiatric
beds continued. The consequence is the reduction of psychiatric
beds and the apportioning of new construction projects
beds. It goes without saying that recording is guaranteed for anyone who really
need to have, even in crisis situations.

Belgium has enough psychiatrists but these are often overloaded because other professions
with a qualification for treating mental problems here a much more modest role
play and their performances are not refundable within the statutory health insurance.

766.

We provide reimbursement of psychotherapy by the legal
health insurance on the basis of recognition of professional qualifications, careful
intake procedure and according to scientific and operational criteria. This is a
of the funds contributing to the improvement of the spiritual
health of our population and thus help in the long term lead to a
significant reduction in the use of psychotropic drugs, the number of
stay in the "psychiatry" and certain of the number zelfdodingenzelfdodingen.

health care for people in insecurity.

768.

We develop a scientifically based analysis of the need for care
basis for a global integrated programming for mental
healthcare sector.

769.

We are strengthening high priority specific areas within the mental
health such as suicide prevention, combating depression and burnout,
forensic psychiatry and care for internees. We address the shortage
on child psychiatry at, including in psychiatric hospitals. For
young people with psychiatric problems combined with aggression and
behavioral be provided additional supply. We also ask that the
insurance companies do not exclude or discriminate against mental illnesses.

770.

We constantly monitor the affordability of mental health.
But even so, we work the intangible barriers to access to the
mental health brake away. Trained experts in
poverty are used in mental health within the framework
of poverty.

The negative perception of mental illness is an additional, not inconsiderable
obstacle to rehabilitation and reintegration.

771.

We will focus on removing the stigma and making discussion of spiritual
health issues in society. We put actions on a broad
public, for example on the basis of concrete evidence of (ex-) patients. For
target groups such as young people, specific campaigns desirable.

772.

We create an appropriate channel to promote the interests of psychiatric
patients and their families.

773.

To increase the flow of (ex) patients in mental health care to the
society to facilitate, among other guidance in teaching, tutoring
a custom job and labor care absolutely necessary. Specific attention for
affordable housing with appropriate support (including through initiatives
the level of social housing and mediation) is a crucial prerequisite.

In contrast to the overall financing of psychiatric hospitals
Hospitals still defined by the antiquated criteria of number of beds, occupancy rates
and a quota system. This poses a persistent financial incentive to patients as much and as long
possible to keep in the hospital.

180

774.

As in other countries, we make the transition to a modern financing
psychiatric hospitals, based on a mix of forfait, global
budgets, performance remuneration and reward system for quality.

775.

We apply the training and further training of staff in mental
health care and the staff in the framework provisions to new
commands, such as 'outreach', so that sufficient competence guaranteed
becomes. Professional providers outside of mental health gain
additional training so that they acquire the necessary competencies to
alarms to identify and to adequately and timely referral.

We prevent problematic substance use
For an efficient approach to care and assistance with substance dependence, we must come to
a wide-ranging multidisciplinary cooperation between the various care providers who turn to

transferred to the Communities), but also mental health, general

In terms of preventive measures and early intervention, we note that we are vulnerable
groups all too often do not reach: homeless, truants, youth who have been abused physically,
offenders, children of parents using.

779.

For sp.a are the needs and requirements of the means-tested person
the starting point for the organization of care and assistance. Assistance to
addicts should include more than the withdrawal of treatment. We
181

provide a sustained period of aftercare and assistance where there is an eye for
family support, housing, employment and the strengthening of social
network of the patient.
780.

We make regarding substance use work of strengthening preventive
actions (through information and individual information channels) and early intervention
(actions that are aimed at groups at higher risk of dependence), with
additional efforts for vulnerable groups.

To prevent problematic substance use, we work on the

sp.a invests more in harm reduction. This includes the further
development of local needle exchange points, along with local authorities and
welfare services. They have an integrated operation: recuperation and delivery
of injection equipment, hazards on advice from unhygienic use and
guidance to healthcare.

4.5 Together, stay healthy
The healthier society, the happier and more productive. By investing together in
health prevention and promotion we are going as a society to move forward.
Health care is not just about the care and healing of sick people. Guaranteed to
important is the use of medicine to keep people healthy. Our country lags some
investing in prevention concerns behind. While the OECD countries on average 3 percent of their
health budget spent on prevention remains Belgium stabbing at 0.15 percent. Big groups
today still fall outside the scope of meaningful preventive measures (such as vaccination and
182

screening programs and preventive controls). As with the treatment of diseases must
accessibility a key priority in the prevention policy.
Essential to stay healthy are our habits. Many chronic diseases are not
for nothing called lifestyle diseases. They avoid asking the right information and necessary
resources. We reach through health promotion. We pay attention to the strong
social inequality.
A healthy life today is not equally accessible to everyone. Here we want
to change that. sp.a wants to give everyone the opportunity to live in good health.

787.

sp.a going for an ambitious prevention. We attract the budget
prevention significantly. This way a catching up.

788.

Preventive examinations and vaccinations, whose value
scientifically proven, must reach the entire target population. We choose
for the easy, cost-free government programs to the entire
target population to achieve. For hard-to-reach groups we deliver extra
efforts.

790.

We avoid harmful and inefficient screening examinations. Senseless or
malicious acts is nobody better.

791.

Through health promotion we give people their health back in your hands.
We always leave an emancipatory logic. Individual behavior should never
result in punishment or exclusion from healthcare. Due to health promotion
target specific groups, such as people in insecurity and
young people, we give everyone opportunities in health.

792.

Regarding we put into health promotion on healthy eating and
exercise habits. We take steps to healthy eating and exercise
to make available to everyone. So we give greater attention to
healthy food in schools.

5.5 We capture needs in the long-term care
To the needs in the long-term care, in particular the elderly, to cope with a gradual
transition to new forms of care is crucial. Investing in the expansion of the existing
care is absolutely necessary but "more of the same 'is not enough. To the challenges of
future to the care sector should be different and will mainly work smarter. Health innovation is
the winning strategy to change the way we care.

183

More than half of the chronically ill, dependent elderly and disabled people
monthly walk burdened by financial concerns through the combination of high health care costs and a
limited income. We remedy this through an inclusive system that makes affordable care for all
people, regardless of their abilities and incomes. This solidarity system we implement for all forms
of care, regardless of their living situation. The choice of the appropriate type of care at home, semimuraal (where the patient care institutions in the daytime and staying overnight at home) or residential
shall bear no financial consequences for the health care costs of the elderly.
If we need care that our freedom should not limit too much. Care needs to help people
to integrate themselves rather than to isolate them. We want care that not only protects and patronizes
gives people strength and control. Research shows us that older people much more than before self
directed by their aging and care to take control.

Ensure affordable care for all elderly
To dependent persons who require long-term care, at home or in a residential
facility care bill can exceed their resources. To the affordability of
to ensure care for all older people, we carry a maximum invoice for home care and residential care
in. This will prevent people who live at home postpone needed care making them more
hospitalizations know and eventually end up faster in the nursing home. So
we prevent older people financially dependent on family or social be because of the
admission to a nursing home.

793.

There will be a maximum invoice for care, which makes the cost of home care
residential care and never exceed the financial capacity of the user. The
invoice of the nursing home must not exceed the pension. Due to these
measures the maintenance obligation can be abolished.

794.

Users have to know how much of the law in advance
home care will pay, so they did not before the end of the month
surprises. That is why we set up a computerized system
legs to allow the client to know the cost of the service without difficulty
comes.

795.

Dienstencheques offer in the first place comfort services for workers. The
increasing demand for home care for dependents should be based on the
residential care decree funded

In the sixth state reform is the transfer of control of the prices of residential care centers
provide for the Communities. The retirement rate is now the responsibility of the federal Economic
Affairs.

796.

After the transfer of the price control we get the resident's contribution
the nursing home from the economic sphere. The contribution to the cost of care is
the same for everyone and guarantees quality care. Each resident can
184

enjoy good conditions in terms of housing, food and
activities for a reasonable and transparent price.
The government has set the supplements may be in the nursing home
charged. But the "transparent nursing home bill 'is therefore not yet realized. In many
cases, it remains unclear what can be the occupant during a hospital stay
charged. Daily prices are difficult to compare because the nursing home a
'supplement' should be incorporated in the daily rate.

797.

We make daily prices and invoices in the residential care more transparent and
uniform. Today part of the mobility equipment is reimbursed by
the statutory health insurance (federal) and a supplementary part by the Flemish
Agency for Persons with Disabilities (VAPH). The reimbursement from the
Agency refers to a second trolley, environmental control,
maintenance and repair costs. Sixty-five Plussers can in most cases
only rely on the intervention of the insurance. The sixth

798.

The granting of full powers to Flanders and the budget
the mobility equipment means that this policy is streamlined and so
customer-oriented organized as possible. We bring an independent age
aids policy regimes.

The contribution we pay to the Flemish care insurance currently provides 103 million euros
on. The health insurance is only one-third funded by contributions and for two
third parties from the general budget.

799.

The existing annual contribution to the health insurance is largely flat and
not solidarity. The continued development of the Flemish part of the social
assurance we strive to organize the financing maximum solidarity.

We build the care of the future
The elder care and home care is still too much of a separately operating several structures
specializations and organizations with numerous dividers. There is too little collaboration with healthcare and
health care facilities that do not traditionally belong to the elderly, such as the
primary care (general practitioners, allied health) and the bearers of healthcare technology.
For sp.a the user must have access to a seamless and gapless
collaborative supply of home care, residential care and all intermediate forms (such as daily, and night shelters
short stay). This makes the care quality and more cost efficient. It was found that older people who
profession usually do at home nursing may postpone a residential recording and so the
shorten overall duration of the recording. Of those now in Flanders for a
185

woonzorgcentrum go, made only 40 percent in the three years before use
home nursing.
The development of (new) ambulatory and semi-residential care are the most important
trend of the future.

800.

sp.a relies on a strong government, a more focused and compelling
government action and good governance to the rising supply needs
elderly care and home care in the future to be the boss.

801.

More places in facilities and more hours of home care are necessary, as
more care coordination and -Direction and greater flexibility in the availability.
Cooperation in the user's interest will lead to greater efficiency and
quality improvement.

802.

We give the care facilities and services with confidence
integrated and continuous care process to work for every user and we
empower them for that. Monitoring, data sharing and control we give
a place on the meso level, for example, the care region.

In many countries practice the local authorities successfully an important function in the
organization of long term care.

803.

We give local authorities an important guiding role in the direction and coordination of the
elderly care and home care. This increases the democratic legitimacy of the care management.
Users find in the Social House or at social service organizations such as
health insurance a point of contact for a wide range of care-related questions, not
only in terms of the available supply but also on informal care, volunteering,
ideological support and testament. There will be implemented for the
existing expertise and networking.

Dependent persons prefer to remain living at home for the sake of independence and
quality of life available to them there. Choose when you get up and go to bed,
when you eat and drink and with whom you want to handle it, is still the best. In an institution or at home
live may well not be black and white story. Both types of care should optimally
Connect.

804.

We ensure that home care and residential care - and all possible variations
between - are fully complementary and best possible fit together. We
also focusing on the expansion and differentiation of the day and
night shelters (such as shelters for less intensive care profiles, dementia patients
and palliative patients). Home care is more flexible, broadening
services and more opportunities for evening and weekend care. We keep
also take into account the residents' profile (eg. departments gestures lingual deaf).

186

805.

We are creating more opportunities for older people temporarily in a
nursing home to be recorded or part-time living at home and in a
residential facility or just overnight stay in a facility.

One of the challenges of the future, patients with complex disease profiles if possible
(again) to leave home to live.

806.

People with complex care profiles must have a home affordable,
can have quality care system, with the use of the most modern
practices and the latest technological capabilities.

sp.a chosen in elderly care and home care for a bold shift from supply
for needs-based care. Everyone has their own interests and their own life history and
family background, but also their own social and health needs, their own abilities and personal
preferences. Care facilities have the task of the personal integrity of users
with respect to the aim of improving their quality of life ..

807.

Each user has a personal care plan is drawn up on the basis of a
Accurate classification of care needs. It is up to the users choices
make, including whether they care at home, in a residential setting or in a
mixed form like. It is essential to administrative and organizational
To avoid nuisance to the user.

808.

We provide independent advice and guidance on the formulation and implementation
of the care plan, for example through a case manager to inefficient and
overuse of care but also to prevent under-consumption.

Care for each other is not replaceable, even by the best professional care. Informal care is
also the best guarantee against loneliness of the elderly.

809.

We take the support measures for a caregiver
full status. Caregivers of severely dependent persons are
with advice and assistance of professionals (social
workers, psychologists ...). In this way, we prevent them after a period of time
be overloaded.

Our long-term care not inferior to that of most countries. Yet many
elderly are not the way to the care that is most appropriate for them. An example: we find in
our residential care centers still with more than a quarter of the residents care a light profile.
These elderly people have little or no benefit from the high-intensity care in assisted living centers for
is found. For the care needs of these and other target groups we develop alternative
answers.
We support the path that one of the four pilot projects in which the new concepts
healthcare examine their practical feasibility. We look at how the informal network
187

help out in the care of the elderly. And there are new housing concepts tested by the social
promote interaction.

810.

We create more experimental with new types of assisted living, Buurtzorg,
grocery shopping and chores services in condominiums, support
care, use of diagnostic and care robots, telemedicine and telecare
(via computer or TV screen).

811.

It is important to the development and testing of innovative
models of care or care products are not above the heads of the end users
take place. The creation of a context in which the elderly are seen
as actors in the construction of society forms the central
challenge. Self-direction, autonomy and participation of older people in innovation
elderly central themes.

Proper care environment makes it easier to live, and a custom environment requires
less worry. There is much to gain efficiencies in the elderly through innovative
housing policy. Around 40 percent of the homes of the elderly appear not currently adapted to
health and mobility problems. We summarize the environment not only material on:
embedded in a social network is critical for elderly living at home. We
should not expect these networks in all cases spontaneously remain.

812.

The property, the environment and everything that goes with it (such as sufficient
accessible public transport, providing accessible and utilities
safety in and outside the home) can be adapted to an aging
society.

813.

We are working on a more positive social climate, ample meeting opportunities and
more close involvement in our neighborhoods and villages. These are important
building blocks for the development of social networks of older adults. We
invest in the innovation of the service centers and support
associations to build social networks and strengthen.

New types of care (decent housing, telecare, service, home automation ...) keep the danger
in which they are picked up quickly by people who are already well served in care.

814.

Not only in the existing care but also in innovative forms of care we build
the guarantee of equal access to care.

A qualitative and accessible care for all
The quality of elderly care and home care is our key concern. Therefore
have prices and quality of care are defined collectively; this offers the best
guarantee affordable, accessible and quality care for all. The allocated budget

188

must be sufficient to cover the real needs and the government must safeguard quality and
accessibility.

815.

The quality finds fulfillment in a differentiated approach where both
visitation, accreditation and inspection of the normative care facilities a
take place. The care processes and to the extent this is possible,
care outputs are continuously evaluated by all stakeholders: users,
staff, scientists, insurance companies, government, and society
its entirety. This compares to a fair and viable financing
care facilities.

Currently, Flanders does not have a scientific instrument for determining which
needs long-term care on the population exist.

816.

We develop a scientifically based, practical programming tool for planning short and medium term for the elderly
and home care by health regions in Flanders. It goes without saying that there is sufficient
parameters must be provided to the specific situation of a particular
municipality, within the healthcare area, objective assessment. We set the
needs objectively and then link them to an integrated model
of forms of care.

Our elderly should adopt a policy of openness towards the ever more conscious and
assertive users.

817.

We put services out to States to continue their complaint management
construct and to improve the communication with the user. The target group of
the Residential Care Line we expand the users of home care services, which are not
have a central complaints desk.

The Brussels Observatory for Health and Social calculated that elderly people with different
cultural background in 2007 already accounted for a third of the Brussels elderly population. Expect
is that this share by 2020 could rise to about half of the Brussels elderly.
Often this involves a group of low-skilled, vulnerable older people who are not familiar
our health care system.

818.

The diversity of our population must be reflected better in our
care. The regulations we pay more attention to the
diversity issues.

We expect all residential care centers with a staff working framework that sufficient safeguards
provides for the quality of care, for example in terms of waiting times for care and
urgent care. In some residential care centers, especially in the commercial sector, it is still wrong.
Moreover, there arise other problems: a lack of sufficiently trained
189

staff, unadjusted

infrastructure,

no

adapted

call system,

no

819.

We do not profit maximization in healthcare because it leads, almost inevitably,
to selection (choice of profile the people that most fetching) and a
minimum quality of care (eg through savings on staffing).

820.

The existing commercial residential care centers must provide the necessary guarantees
in terms of financial transparency and reinvestment of revenues in
quality of care.

Flanders has an estimated 100,000 people with dementia. It is expected that this figure
2020 will be increased to 130,000. More than two-thirds of people with dementia live
home. Many dementia patients earth not in a large nursing home: the attendance and
opportunities for communication with health care providers are not tailored to the needs of these
group of people with dementia.

821.

We refine the dementia plan. Dementia requires an integrated and
multidisciplinary approach. We take into account the diversity of our
population. Specific attention is given to the young-dementia.

822.

The small-scale housing for people with dementia we build further,
taking into account cost effectiveness and quality improvement.

The long-term care for the elderly in nursing homes should not be medicalized, it is
After all, no 'cure' but 'care facilities. But a lot of referrals from residents
nursing homes to the hospital (eg, dehydration) are avoidable provided that a more
appropriate medical care locally. Given the increasingly serious concern profile of residents
we want the development of appropriate medical care structure in the living centers odds
offer a more efficient and quality care than the current fragmented approach.

823.

Specialist nurses (nurse practitioners) for the elderly
get in control of the multidisciplinary treatment team in the
residential care centers. They will consult with residents and family and work
GP to optimize the quality of life and the consequences of
conditions to reduce as much as possible.

824.

For all residents of the nursing home, a care treatment
drawn. Consisting of a medical treatment and a care plan, which
goals are aligned. When drawing is increasingly determined whether
return home or part-time residence is feasible. The plan sufficient
attention to rehabilitation and preventive actions, such as flu vaccination
and the prevention of the infection (such as MRSA).

190

On the need for a co-ordinated the area of ​​medicinal products in the residential care centers
approach. For the residents, often with a complex disease, is used correctly
medicines of primary importance.

825.

In the nursing home is designated a central computerized
system to implement drug dispensing, application of
the medicine formulary.

We have to score better in disease prevention in the elderly. So by the influenza vaccination in the elderly,
which you can save a lot of care, only 60 percent of the target group.

826.

In home care, we encourage the care planning for older users in the field
preventive interventions such as vaccinations (eg influenza) and
prevention of chronic and disabling pathologies, such as diabetes,
chronic lung disease, obesity, malnutrition, or muscle weakness.

5.6 Optimal care and assistance when life is approaching
A palliative patient is a person in an advanced or terminal phase of a
severe, progressive and life-threatening illness is. In the period 2008 - 2012 it took
number of patients requiring palliative networks started up a guidance by 18 percent.
Belgium offers a wide range of palliative care structures. The main task of the
Palliative care does not exist in the general care (such as primary care, residential care,
home care, ...) to replace but to support it and work with it together.
Palliative care is expanded so have the proportion of patients who benefit from it
is broader and less selective. The needs are so palliative care for people
with a severe chronic illness (eg. heart failure, lung disease) and dementia yet
often overlooked.

827.

Palliative care is the patient. Anyone who benefits from
Palliative care should be given a personal coordinated palliative care plan, which
works regardless of where the person resides (home, nursing home, hospital or
palliative care unit). This approach ensures the continuity of care.

828.

Patients and their representatives are better informed about the
capabilities of the Patients, the provision of palliative care and the
Euthanasia. Now, this knowledge is usually limited.

829.

We are working on a custom instrument for palliative
standardize care needs of patients, even in children, and so their rights

191

to better guarantee palliative assistance. Moreover, it is necessary, suitable
quality indicators to identify palliative care.
830.

Basic palliative care is included in the curriculum of all
caregivers and also offered as continuing education by the
scientific associations. The contents of this basic course is aimed at
all health care needs of the patients, including symptom control,
communication, social problems and spiritual needs. Additionally strengthen
we training for 'specialized palliative care program.

Currently, there are many persons who have a right to palliative care lump sum which there is no use
of it. The palliative lump sum is linked to other benefits such as the elimination of the
co-payment by the patient for palliative home care, visits to the doctor and
Physiotherapy kind.

831.

All patients should have a right to palliative care lump sum that
actually received.

The financing of home care teams must be more transparent and abuses (such as single
over the phone or on-going contacts with the patients) we want to avoid.
832.

A more transparent and efficient rules for subsidizing
palliative home care teams is necessary.

Due to the specific health needs of visitors to the palliative day care centers must
framework for these centers are larger than for example the day care centers
elderly.

833.

Palliative day care centers be expanded both the number of sites (now
there are five in Flanders) as the amount of available places, under
in the big cities. These centers have a structural collaboration
developing with one or more adjacent (day) hospitals.

The role of palliative care in the hospital environment is crucial to the medical sp.a
persistence to break through and to fulfill the desire of people to die at home.
834.

We build the functioning of the hospital palliative teams further and
ensure their multidisciplinary.

We are expanding the euthanasia legislation in
The expansion of the euthanasia legislation in the opinion skilled minors was also on
initiative sp.a realized. Many other issues, however, were not yet regulated.

192

835.

sp.a committed to expand also in the euthanasia law to people who
hit by an incurable and irreversible brain disorder, as they
that in a preformatted living will their choice for euthanasia
have given know.

836.

An advance directive for euthanasia will continue unless revoked, unlimited
valid at the time. The electronic identity is logged on
what treaties they have.

837.

As a treating physician does not meet the demand of a patient wants to euthanasia
meeting, she or he should be required to refer the patient to a physician's
patient wants help and within a defined, short period after the
the request of the patient.

5.7 Working in making care more attractive
The welfare and health care sector is an important employer, 12 per cent of employment
part in Flanders. Facilities wishing to provide good care need a
effective organization that offers a pleasant and meaningful workplace for employees. A
improved work organization with optimal opportunities for everyone to be flexible and on a
quality, sustainable and innovative way to work together, so it is a must.  The
job satisfaction and employee involvement must be raised.

838.

We are working on the development of the care professions a sound HR policy, less burdensome and more transparent work schedules and less
hierarchical workplace organization. We create more opportunities for employees
to improve self affairs and innovate together and responsibilities
take self-managing teams.

839.

A better division of labor, and deliver an optimal cooperation
efficiency gains and enrich each job. Now, a nurse 20 percent
of the time engaged in non-nursing tasks as well by a health care provider
can be performed.

840.

We commissioned by caring people that sufficient competence to do so
have, but not by people who are qualified and therefore are more expensive.
Duties of the doctor should go to the nurse and the nurse
the Nursing Auxiliary.

841.

Flanders invests sufficient solidarity in the welfare and health
so the real health needs are covered and supply is sufficient
expanded.

842.

To succeed in care, we also renew care training courses.
Education and practice are better coordinated and more cooperation.
The better combination of learning and working is essential.

193

843.

Those working in the care sector, should be able to re-orient themselves more easily,
for instance from a residential to an ambulatory environment. We choose
a broad basic education and teachers who work part-time in practice.

844.

The expected 'verwitting' of the labor market requires facilitating
entered the labor market, expanding the programs offered
care professions, the active recruitment of disadvantaged and encouraging
men to take care professions.

5.8 We are strengthening the Flemish care policy
The transition time from the sixth state reform for sp.a is an excuse
challenges in health care to provide a response and the care in the coming decades
affordable, accessible and keeping quality.
sp.a opts for a fresh start in the design of efficient management of the whole of the
now exercised and the newly transferred competencies. We thereby the choices
role that the various actors involved - users and user associations, government, lenders,
health insurance (health funds), and other stakeholders - to perform. We thereby move on the line
the foundations on which is based the federal health care by relying on
co-management of the stakeholders.

845.

We note, in consultation with the stakeholders, the general welfare policies from
on the basis of the Flemish health objectives. We explain the
determine strategic choices of care policy, focusing on the
partnerships with other policies aiming an inclusive
after approach and opt for a personal approach. For the implementation of this
policy we rely on co-management of the stakeholders at a high level.

846.

Flanders invests sufficient solidarity in the welfare and health
so the real health needs are covered and supply is sufficient
expanded.

847.

The budgets for health care to be transferred under the
State reform in Flanders remain reserved for welfare and care.

848.

The state reform, which is accompanied by the homogenization of a number of
powers, is an opportunity for administrative simplification
enter under the user and the provider.

194

6 SHARING EXPERIENCES
1.6 Culture binds us
sp.a believes in the power of culture and culture for everyone. Culture beats in the heart of the
society, gives shape and meaning to individual and society. Culture determines the way
in which society takes shape, and is therefore much more than the proverbial icing on the
cake. Culture connects the past, present and future generations together, encourages large
measure the effectiveness and expansion of social networks and simultaneously contributes to the critical sense and
autonomy of people. All things that help to overcome difficulties in our lives.
We strive for a world where people meet, unite, talking and listening,
make and tastes, disagree, plan activities, relax together. Is there
culture created and she is always and everywhere present. Culture makes clear what we share and present
connections between people across all domains.

Culture as a prerequisite for an open and democratic society
Everyone should be able to come into contact with culture. For sp.a culture is a prerequisite for
a democratic society, in which creative, confident and critical citizens develop
and subvert society. A society that reduces culture to luxury in times of
surplus loses vitality, creativity and panache.

849.

sp.a states with conviction the need to invest in culture. Government
has a crucial role in supporting all forms of culture.

850.

We opt for a policy in which everyone gets a fair chance to own
and in which people can develop artistic and creative expression or of the
cultural activities to enjoy. Cultural policy, we do not separate from social policy
and education.

851.

Culture goes sp.a about sharing (creative) expression, knowledge,
experiences and opinions. It is a dynamic system in which we values,
create symbols and identities and confront. Culture in this sense
necessary for the formation of our identity, for the deployment of men
and for the development of creativity. For us its multiple identities and
overlapping.

852.

Quality means signified exclusivity for 'the happy few. On the contrary, sp.a
formulated on the basis of quality a matter for all stakeholders, with a large
diversity of tastes, genres and practices.

853.

sp.a going for broad support of the cultural sector in all
diversity, and in the broadest sense. From amateur to
heritage work of art schools to seniors festivals. It gives people the
195

creativity to social developments and new entrants with the necessary
openness to meet artists and art lovers as well as the necessary
space to go at their own pace and level to start and discover ....
Invest in culture for everyone
With sp.a we give space to culture for everyone. For us this means sustainable investments
good infrastructure and accommodation, give confidence and with opportunities for culture
experience and at policy level to ensure the necessary resources. sp.a favors a
cross-sectoral cultural policies. This requires a holistic approach, devoid of stereotypical thinking, with concrete
links to education, welfare and economy.

854.

In the cultural sector volunteers play a crucial role. sp.a has in the past
many realized for the protection of volunteers. They are irreplaceable and
precisely why we fill the legal framework optimally, without excessive
rules. sp.a therefore calls for a uniform system for the volunteers
positive elements of the small fees, voluntary fee
and includes compensation for occasional socio-cultural performance. We advocate
In addition, for a good framework of volunteer work in Flanders
so that organizations are supported in their volunteer work. In addition, it is
vital to combat abuse, without the well meaning
volunteer is the first victim of this.

855.

We take several decrees on culture and heritage under scrutiny and
vote them off on each other from the perspective of the present-day
cultural experience. We want effective links between education, culture, tourism
and media. Also, welfare and employment are necessary as well.

856.

sp.a strongly believes in the strength and quality of the social and artistic practices.
These are intersections where the arts have active content while their
emancipating and develop creative opportunities. We provide social and artistic
practices more opportunities and support so that they are everywhere in Flanders their offering
can open up.

857.

sp.a fosters local initiatives and contacts. So will sp.a wants more public space
use by encouraging co-management with neighborhood and district committees. And we
examine whether the existing educational and cultural infrastructure is not optimally
can be utilized, for example during holidays, by local cultural
organizations. We foster local initiatives and contacts.

858.

sp.a carries a strong co-Cultural Community. We are working on a strong
cultural relationship between the Dutch and the French-speaking community
in which we show ourselves as a motivated and ambitious partner in the implementation
the cultural cooperation agreement. Moreover, we increase
involvement of communities across Brussels and the federal cultural
institutions.

196

Culture is a basic right. It is up to the government to ensure that everyone has full access
to culture in various forms. It is not for the public authority to which cultural expressions
are preferable. Rather to offer the widest possible choice and people freely
choose.

859.

We continue to work on a close network of institutions and cultural operators,
with artists, mediators and program makers, libraries,
cultural centers, part-time art, dance and music. New disciplines, styles
and art forms have the necessary space and attention.

860.

sp.a believes and invests in a cultural offer for such a large and diverse
possible group of people. We attention and respect for the cultural
individuality of everyone.

861.

We sensitize cultural organizations and institutions will be permanently open
up to a large audience; regardless of age, ancestry, place of residence,
education or art form.

862.

sp.a goes for custom rates and an accessible cultural infrastructure. We
shape a cultural policy that puts living links with other
policy areas such as education, economy or welfare. We reach a wider
crowd with custom tariffs, a well-coordinated communication and links
with public transport. sp.a argues that the timetables of De Lijn,
STIB and SNCB allow everyone to participate in, more
especially enjoyable date, cultural activities. sp.a recognizes the important
sensitizing role that the media have to promote the
cultural participation. We therefore advocate that the public broadcaster
giving sufficient attention to culture, both transversal, through the
regular supply, and through targeted and in-depth programs. Clear
enforceable and measurable agreements should be about
included in the new management

Culture close to you
sp.a strives for immediate culture. Proximity gives everyone the best possible chance to sample several
culture forms. A social democratic culture has an eye for what leaves from the bottom up, from
that lives in neighborhoods and districts. What touches people and makes a lasting impression. They are mostly local
initiatives to make that succeed ages and various ethnic groups together. The
government supports and stimulates these initiatives where appropriate. We give everyone the opportunity
to create, to be an artist and thereby reach an audience.

863.

sp.a stresses the importance of good infrastructure with lasting culture
focus on public libraries, cultural and community centers, surrounded
through a network of associations. Together they ensure a strong and broad
participation, anywhere and at different stages of life. We therefore propose

197

an infrastructure plan. We search for new ways of
vacant buildings such as churches, etc.
864.

Social-artistic practices, specifically focused on forgotten and disadvantaged
groups deserve support. We reach audiences not otherwise
hardly find cultural experience. These actions are just in times of crisis
often under pressure. sp.a defend this valuable sector. The social-artistic
offer deserves a full place in all spheres of cultural policy.

865.

Investing in communities creates a broad basis for community life.
A government that pays attention to creating a healthy pleasant districts
breeding ground for culture.

866.

sp.a supports the socio-cultural work. We actually want to work on
emancipation, community building and encounters, we should like
company will continue to invest in this sector and go to work as a coach.

Actively participating in culture
The belief that culture is good and essential for people and society, should as much as possible
people in contact with a broad cultural offer. Culture ensures
interculturalisation because it confronts people with the limits of their individuality and shakes them
awake. Conditions for collective progress. The current landscape and the current
offer are not always well suited to the complex society.
The participation, in its many forms and intensities, can and must be much larger, wider,
depth. This goes much further than a count of theater or museum visitors of sold
tickets or cultural products. sp.a wants people to freely choose their own
expressions of culture. Real freedom of choice is on the possibility to take part on the basis of
sound information, knowledge and skills to choose. This freedom of choice is never
self-evident. It is largely determined by home environment, education and income.

867.

sp.a tackles the unequal choice to culture by better social conditions.
This requires accurate communication and information tailored to different
target groups, a modified cost, eliminating physical and mental
barriers, barriers of communication, accessibility, and mobility
childcare.

868.

An accessible location makes no representation accessible to people
with disabilities. Possibilities here include loops or
Feel chairs. sp.a sees this as part of the subsidy. We examine whether a
new regulations on access to public insurance
events is needed.

869.

For sp.a is an integrated participatory policy which focuses not only on the
broad and diverse cultural field but also on education, associations, sport
and much more domains.
198

870.

Local government plays an important role in the debate on participation. It is the
municipalities with local stakeholders such as schools, community centers,
libraries,
part-time
art education,
youth facilities,
etc.
working relationships to leisure activities for everyone
to make it accessible. Local culture should be seen thus as the engine
for a broad and diverse participation policy in the region. Therefore, this can not be limited
continue to merely organizing activities within their own cultural managed
infrastructure such as cultural or community centers, etc.

871.

sp.a committed to culture vouchers. Targeted use of these coupons
offers opportunities to learn about cultural expressions that are unknown.
We put structural collaborations legs between cities and towns,
CPAS and associations of people in poverty. We rollers of the system
Uitpas from throughout Flanders so that everyone in a non-stigmatizing way
enjoy sports and cultural landscape. For young people, we hold
1euro to the scheme. Young people under 26 years old can for just one euro museums
visit.

Interculturalism as a step towards a shared culture
Migration and (super) diversity is a fact that in Europe and ideally in Flanders and Brussels.
For sp.a this means an enrichment of our society. At the same time we are not blind to the
frictions associated. Culture can and should play an important role and binding.

872.

We embed the diversity model better in the educational curriculum and the
Attainment of Flemish education. In addition to its cultural knowledge skills
necessary so that young people creative 'play' with change.

873.

sp.a believes in self-help organizations, societies where people organize themselves,
also based on a common ethno-cultural identity. This
associations offer opportunities for the cultural identity of various
communities cherish. They form the necessary bridges to many
other players, not least the government.

874.

Interculturalism presumes contacts between different communities.
It is an active and reciprocal process: moving towards each other, bridges
cross, different angles dare to handle. Therefore encourages sp.a
associations continue to through collaboration (temporarily or permanently) with
other (cultural) associations to take steps in this process.

875.

sp.a respects the expertise of socio-cultural organizations working with
disadvantaged groups. We recognize them for more here and involve them more in
participation policy and also call on the expertise in these organizations
developed more to count towards the operation of more established cultural - and
arts organizations.

199

Culture do your kids grow
Cultural education is an indispensable link. In a complex and diverse society, it is desirable
for children, youth and adults to provide a broad educational culture project. We
continue on the same path as described in the concept paper "Growth in Culture".

876.

sp.a adds a new component to the human teacher. spa
also provides more resources for cultural activities during school hours
to the coverage.

877.

Cultural education affects the motivation and social skills of our
students. Every child needs a base within the curriculum of education
cultural literacy can build. It teaches them work together better and
communicate. Wherefore come sp.a for a full place of culture in the
(basic) education. We plead for the orientation and introductory courses, which now
mentioned in the draft decree of part-time education, the sooner
integrate into the curriculum of primary education. In addition,
Cooperation between education and local cultural life and promoted
supported. Best practices should be spread and a structural
get embedding. Wherefore come sp.a for a full place of culture in the
(basic) education. Where appropriate we enter into cooperation with cultural
institutions, organizations within the amateur arts and sociocultural
clubs.

878.

sp.a put partnerships between attendance and part-time
art education, higher art, alternative providers of
art education and amateur arts. So the cultural knowledge and grow
skills in the widest possible group of young people. CANON Cultural and
ACCE play a prominent role. sp.a wants to establish cultural pilot projects
in the sector of the playgrounds and youth movements. These projects
be proactive, commitment, offered to the sector, but
specifically aimed at a broad participation of children and young people from home
off have fewer opportunities for cultural participation.

879.

To pursue an integrated policy on cultural sp.a strives for more
policy space in culture for less fragmentation, more structural
consolidation and structural bridges. We start a newsletter from the
Culture Administration, focusing on education and guidance.

Amateur arts: building blocks for cultural Flanders
Our amateur landscape is very rich and diverse. 37 percent of the Flemish and Brussels
Pursuing an artistic hobby in their spare time. The frequency of practice is high. This
participation also translates into active participation in the professional art offerings. spa
aims to at least maintain this participation whopping increase yet.

200

880.

We continue to encourage the amateur arts and lead as many people as possible
as much as possible environments for the amateur arts.

881.

Amateur Arts need a well-developed infrastructure network
for performances, rehearsals and exhibitions. sp.a proposes a strategic
approach at district and neighborhood level.

882.

Co-productions and co-creations are beautiful examples of qualitative
support and guidance between the amateur and professional arts
arts. sp.a supports partnerships and further encourages them.

883.

sp.a attaches great importance to the exchanges and project-based collaboration across
borders. A review and possible adjustment of the international
project operation is imperative.

884.

Together with the industry we wish to get a clear picture of the scale and
the reach of the amateur arts. To this end, at regular intervals,
scientific research is necessary. These studies make adjustments on
Based on figures and data as possible.

Socio-cultural work builds and enriches
Civil society organizations including socio-cultural work have a growing interest in our
changing society: they build social capital and enrich people. In addition,
These organizations have a strong sensitizing effect.
They aim at a society that provides opportunities for people to develop themselves, to have fun together
to do, to give them a voice. Today it is more than ever necessary to make this vision of man and
society, even against (political) currents in to defend aloud.

885.

We revalue the socio-cultural adult work. The social
impacts from this sector - integration, education, floor, citizenship ... - his
not to be underestimated. This is endorsed in a higher (re-) financing
the socio-cultural work.

886.

sp.a provides space for adult education and training institutions to their role on
lifelong and life-wide learning full record. Projects like the community school
and pilot projects are sustainable into policy.

887.

sp.a supports cross-sector initiatives so that the socio-cultural
sector entering into partnerships with other organizations and teaching methods. This
immediately is also true for the connection and interaction with Primary.

888.

sp.a put the next legislature in sufficient infrastructure. We advocate
Therefore a joint act of the Ministers of Education and Culture
To activate the concept of an extended school anymore.

201

889.

sp.a endorses the complaint of many associations about rising
administrative burden. Through various regulations for volunteers
and associations increasingly difficult, not only to inform themselves correctly but also
to assess manageable risks of their commitments. sp.a advocates
a pre-test in order to limit this increasing 'regulitis'. sp.a wants
lead the way to search for a suitable legislation tailored
small sociocultural associations which do not fulfill the current stringent
administrative costs are subjected and still offer protection
those wishing to include a commitment.

890.

The socio-cultural work is a binding factor in our diverse society. She
causes people to meet. Therefore, it is important that these
sector is assigned a definite place between free markets and government. We
working at all levels a framework for socio-cultural organizations.

891.

The socio-cultural sector is innovative. sp.a gives space to widen
and deepen experiment. We make space for socio-cultural innovations
by providing a testing scheme.

Long live the artist
Without artists, not art. A society in which artists have the space to display their
critical view of giving back to society is a society in which there is room for dialogue and
discussion.

892.

sp.a reduces administrative and legal hassles for artists
drastically.

893.

Through a better and clearer definition of the abuse we help
artist status in the world. We examine how the 'federal commission
artists' can play a greater role.

894.

sp.a strives for optimal balance between the inalienable
rights of creative and performing artists (Sabam, fair remuneration,
lending fee, ...) and a transparent, honest and easy system
to collect it. In addition, we wish that a portion of the unallocated
recoveries (contributions which are not linked to a specific artist)
go to support starting artistic talent.

895.

Through specific awareness campaigns we raise awareness of the consumer
importance of copyright and related rights of authors, performers,
publishers and producers. The responsible authorities shall ensure that the
regulations protecting copyright is respected, so
holders are properly compensated.

896.

A fair collection and respect for intellectual property rights are not
opposed to optimum service to the (re) user. What a
analog world can be made available to the general public should
202

also remain available in the digital world. The exceptions to the
copyright must be adjusted accordingly. So sp.a favor of the widening
of the lending fee to digital publications. Libraries so next
books also lend their digital version. Heritage institutions need their
collections via the web in a non-commercial environment to the public can
show. A black hole on the Internet for contemporary art and art from the
twentieth century is undesirable. Audio Books and other reading forms for blind people
and impaired are very cost-intensive and are therefore under a
fall exception rule.
897.

Authors or their dependents on their long-term intellectual property rights (until
up to 70 years after death) want to see honored to have their work
20 year record of their registration to reconfirm the 20 years. That makes a
cost and labor-intensive so-called. diligent search for orphan works
redundant and encourages the creative industries and heritage institutions to
oeuvres to reuse or unlock extensively.

898.

Specifically Audiovisual sp.a taking the lead to thoroughly adjust the tax shelter arrangement and carry out more stringent checks. We examine
whether the scheme could be extended to other sectors such as performing arts,
game industry, and so on. We do this in strong consultation with the sector,
investors and the government. So we will compete with the existing
abuse within the current system and we want to aspiring artists and
arts organizations provide every opportunity to develop within the
landscape. That's why we make sure that within the Arts Decree there
the influx of new initiatives, both at the level of the
operating at the level of project grants.

Creative entrepreneurship gives us oxygen
Creative entrepreneurship is on the rise. Of designers and designers and production houses to ICT
advertising agencies, all they give oxygen to our Flemish cities and municipalities. sp.a shows
therefore literally and figuratively the necessary space to creative minds and entrepreneurs.

899.

With the right nudge anyone can undertake. We boost
development of a network of cooperative basis accommodation for start
entrepreneurs. We also provide coworking checks so they affordable
infrastructure such as office and conference rooms, and a digital support
get sponsorship operation.

900.

We give young budding entrepreneurs the necessary financial support and
security so that they can take risks. We encourage micro-credit and
crowdfunding that provide them with an initial capital.

203

We keep what binds us
Investing in heritage is an investment in our cultural identity, our collective memory. Heritage is
a source of inspiration for new spatial developments and contributes to spatial quality.

901.

948.

sp.a goes with journalists in debate about imaging of children and young people
the media. We ask them to let children and young people to speak for themselves,
them to bring in a different way in the picture and not mentioning
applying full names of minors consistent and uniform

We give volunteers all the space
Youth work plays an important role in the achievement of policy objectives in relation to the
strengthening the social fabric, the shaping of democratic citizenship, promote
lifelong and life-wide learning, constructive learning to deal with diversity. sp.a is proud of
a rich and differentiated youth sector, with a wide range of structurally subsidized
Primary forms. Moreover, we constantly see new initiatives and innovative
youth projects emerge, and this at all levels. The unique fact that these young people
projects and run organizations make youth work in Flanders so special.
Volunteers have an unmistakable added value for society that is much more than a
great economic value. Volunteering strengthens links, enhance social
capital, build networks, and thereby forms the cement from a well-functioning
democratic society. Through this selfless commitment solidarity and participation no
empty words, but concrete deeds. A society must nurture volunteering because
it contributes to the personal development of each volunteer. We want this commitment not
limit by too many rules.

949.

Politics must facilitate engagement, not impossible. We are committed
to the four kinds of regulitis or over-regulation as indicated by the
213

youth sector to address. In concrete terms
lokalenregulitis, fuifregulitis and organisatieregulitis.

about

kampenregulitis,

950.

sp.a is working on an integrated Flemish test in which a
plan load test for associations is included.

951.

Young people and their organizations in Europe remain a separate budget and separate
earn chapter. We keep youth as an end in itself guarantee. This applies
quite definitely for Europe.

952.

Youth work and by extension associations are strong in Flanders.
sp.a developed with young people and civil society a shared vision about the
value of commitments and volunteering for children, young people and the
society. The role of the youth in the society gets a herein
explicit place.

953.

Belgian, Flemish and Brussels youth who are committed outside Flanders
economic and cultural ambassadors of Flanders and Brussels. They get
given the necessary recognition, appreciation and encouragement.

954.

sp.a working for the future ambitions of the youth pact in 2020 and makes of
Flanders, Brussels and Europe a better place for children and young people to
life.

Youth culture for all children and young people
There are children and young people their first experience of culture to go through yet.
Experiencing culture is only for a limited group of people for granted. Can choose
For culture is a right. Not to choose is a form of exclusion. But like children and
Youth culture tolerates no experience imperative. And that is exactly the challenge. The relation
culture, youth and education is sp.a close to my heart. Where education is aimed at teaching
knowledge and facts, culture stimulates youth to release collateral and creatively deal
with that knowledge. The Flemings generation of tomorrow will be more diverse than those of today. Culture
learning par excellence dealing with differences.

955.

sp.a develops a policy on youth and youth culture. Youth and
we fill in broad youth. For us it is about both the environment
of children and young people and the youth artistic interpretation of the concept. We
a policy of children and youth are encouraged to
creative means to gain more control over their environment. This may include
to forms of artistic expression, but also to all forms of youth culture.
A youth cultural policy needs to do more than children and young people to
lead already existing offer within the cultural sector. We encourage
cultural centers, cultural centers, kusntencentra ... to also "to encourage young people '.
For example, through a specific cultural program for and by young people.

3.6 sports together creates a bond
Sport makes you feel good, it gives lust for life. Sports and exercise are healthy for
body and mind, and generate engagement between young and old, rich and poor, old and new
Belgians. The social benefits of a sporting country great - that's why sport is on
eminent domain where a sports-sensitive government can make a difference. By focusing
investing in people and infrastructure, through to titillate and lead by example, by
dreams and do dreams.
The power of sport, people and their projects, find sp.a in the rich and diverse
associational. Sports together provide essential social capital. Sport also brings to
physical and mental fitness and better health. Together sports also means that
hundreds of thousands of Flemings find each other, to draw from its own sports projects, but also to
to think together about sports policy and, often indirectly, on important social
challenges.

Everyone sporting a strong sports landscape
sp.a wants cooperation inbakken in the daily sports activities and sports culture. Local and
provincial governments have only to gain from a close partnership with sports clubs and
sports federations, with youth movements and schools, and local residents - and vice versa. The
growing divisions between sports clubs and sports associations such as looser neighborhood sport and reflect
reinforce social inequalities. We want to again much closer together both tracks
by encouraging sports federations and sports clubs to more innovative thinking about how they
organize and engage socially. Being open to other forms of bonding and new forms
sports, but at the same time continue to focus on quality management and infrastructure.

956.

To get even more people to do even better sports sp.a actively lowers the thresholds
for sports participation. We do this by sports clubs and sports associations looser
bringing closer together. The sport and particularly the athletes have to do is
gain from more flexible and simpler connections between all providers
sports. Lower financial, cultural and practical barriers invite everyone
to sports. We may make an extra effort to keep people in poverty,
To reach ethnic minorities and single parents. With the
literally paving physical thresholds every sports club opens the doors for all
athletes with and without disabilities. Specifically, we will strengthen the local Decree
sports policy "to achieve broader social and cultural participation.
Especially neighborhood sport, which combines sports, community building and neighborhood
together, will be given special attention.

957.

More and more people move beyond the traditional sports and sports club.
Leisure walking, cycling or walking, but equally close to sports everywhere
come to fruition. Our sports federations have this insufficiently picked up. With a
renewed "Decree on the sporting federations' will sp.a Revitalising
Innovative initiatives within the sport. We want cooperation
215

stimulate different actors by the phasing out discrimination between the
different sports and their organizations (Unisport vs. recreational).
Aided by a clearer and simpler regulation concerns the federations
so even better quality assurance, and technical sport and business
support. In the same movement we reassess the objectives of BLOSO
to make it even better assume its supportive role.
958.

To young people at the gym to get let are today too many chances.
Sports clubs and schools are both the requesting party, but nevertheless we succeed
also insufficient in bringing right after school sports and school together. With
more and better organized sports after school hours (via sports club,
youth movement or light structure) wins everyone: children, parents,
sports coaches, our society. Local governments should together with
sports clubs, sports federations and betting schools even stronger after-school sports
at school as concrete implementation of the comprehensive school. With the requested sp.a
new statute for sports coaches already get a major sports clubs
lever to for more flexible quality sports coaching
offer.

959.

Sport truly accessible for people with disabilities goes beyond
the removal of physical obstacles. Within G-Sport will sp.a clear choices
create: for more inclusive participation of persons with disabilities
regular sports clubs, to integrate G-Sport in the sports federations but
the preservation of disability-specific federations (for boccia or Torball) for
a strong supportive and facilitative support center G-Sport Flanders, for
more and better coaches of G-athletes, and most bets on schools
by the much wider rollout of inspiring projects such as the Antwerp
MoVe.

960.

Local governments, sports clubs and sports federations design in organized
Concert physical sport landscape of tomorrow. They thereby set up on
refurbishment, reuse and multiple use of quality infrastructure,
Together with the Flemish government, local business and other partners
such as schools and non-profit organizations. Just as we make the much needed
investments within the budget and ensure maximum utilization of
the existing sports infrastructure. With a friendly and flexible
licensing policy and a more sport-friendly planning policy
sp.a fulfills the necessary conditions for a better sports infrastructure.

The sport of tomorrow must reach even more local people and get and give enthusiasm
to sports. This requires a different support for the sports club yesterday. A
older generation, especially male volunteers who their club with heart and soul and every day
kept running, gives way to more selectively and rapidly changing engagement. To this
commitment to channel to the sports clubs, is a better legal and fiscal framework for
volunteers, coaches and referees absolutely necessary. On top of all the other wants sp.a
regulations that clubs and associations are subject to critically evaluate and lots more transparent
make.
216

961.

Also in associations sp.a sees the government as a customer-friendly
service provider. By far better to make use of the wealth of data which the
various government departments already have in their possession, we reduce the
administrative burden. Through greater transparency in the rules and application
among others SABAM and fair remuneration, everyone pays fair
contributions.

962.

The associations in the sports and socio-cultural sector is groaning under the tax administrative requirements. sp.a committed to the exemption for non-profit btwplicht further go up to € 25,000.

963.

sp.a creates a new statute for sports coaches, including trainers and
referees, and similar functions in the socio-cultural work. The
purposes of this status is that it allows a fair return on
minimum administrative costs and a limited, fixed charge of Security and
payroll. So this statute is black or gray and white work, with an
better protection of the supervisors and, because such work is also created
a positive impact on the budget as a result.

We invest in valuable sport
Successful athletes are a lever for more sport, just ask our local tennis,
hockey or volleyball clubs. Many of them are also role models in addition to the sports field, or would it
nevertheless should be. That is why sport is so important for sp.a. Successful athletes inspire not
just thousands of recreational athletes. By core values ​​such as respect and perseverance a
giving recognizable face days they each of us to give the best of ourselves.

964.

For sp.a sport is about respect. Respect supporters and opponents, for
officials and public, for everyone in society. This applies to all levels,
but above all for athletes. After all, they do much more than inspire people
to work out. Sports Vedetten are also many, rightly or wrongly, not
the least for our young people, an example on and off the sports field. We want
athletes, sports federations and clubs attract many more on this
exemplary turd. Referees influence and cussing, falsely errors
Evoking outright or covert discrimination, doping, all this is at odds
responsibility, respect, honesty and fair play, and not for us
place in sport or society. Within the margins of the decree and medical
responsible sports the government still needs to set a good example and
enforce, including by better substantive support youth sports clubs
on ethical issues.

965.

sp.a encourages stronger clubs to invest in youth.
Inspired by the youth fund in the Flemish basketball, but obviously with
respect for the differences between sporting disciplines, we promote internal
solidarity funds disconnecting the training fee
217

transfer market. So it is free movement of respected players, but get
Clubs still a fair remuneration and creates a significant redistribution between
clubs. In connection with this we draw the minimum wage for players
from outside the EU, and this to 150 percent of the average wage
of the twenty most expensive players per team.
966.

In the same movement wants sp.a an even better professional guidance and
training professional and elite athletes before, during and after their careers. During the
sport training so that athletes learn very early on their exceptional
attitudes - perseverance, the will to win, stress resistance - to
strengthen with useful skills for a successful second career
after (ast) sport. During and after their active careers through targeted
professional development and career coaching, but also with an improved top sport status
that gives the chance to sport and (part-time) to combine work flexibly and
experience outside the sport to build. Successful projects
career guidance for Olympic athletes here are a good example for
other sports.

The twelfth man
967.

sp.a is a real twelfth man in the sport. sp.a takes her engagement
opposite the sports seriously. All of our local directors endorse the
need for sustained investment in sport. When national sport sounding board
the party anyone can go with a variety of questions about sport.

6.4 Tourism in Flanders for everyone
The tourism sector is an important engine of economic growth and employment in
Flanders. The sector offers entrepreneurs a lot of opportunities, and often those without
or to work with a low degree. But we do not constrict tourism to the half-year figures
sector. Tourism relaxes, brings people into contact with each other, providing new experiences and
insights and deepens family life. Tourism makes nature and culture experience. Tourism is
important for the positive image of our country, our region and our city in the rest of the world.
For all these reasons put sp.a in the development, promotion and quality control of the sector.
Our tourism policy is also a social ambition. In a modern society, it may not be as
which tourism is the privilege of people with high incomes. Accessible Tourism for All
must make sure that nobody is excluded.
The development of tourism is done by different entities and by very much
actors, public and private. sp.a goes for a model where collaboration and the pooling of
forces makes the difference.

968.

sp.a tail is not blind to the label 'Flanders'. The interests of the tourism
transcend our state structure. The situation of today in which the various

218

entities in our country all by itself work and conduct promotion, creates
confusion on the outside and sometimes creates more disadvantages than advantages.
969.

sp.a therefore going for a comprehensive cooperation agreement between the Regions
and the communities around our country and our world famous capital Brussels
to promote optimal as a tourist destination. Brussels deserves extra
attention as the main tourist destination and locomotive for the rest of
Flanders.

970.

All tourist actors in a participatory policy in the
planning and implementation. We do not choose a verambtelijkt tourism policy
determined from above.

A powerful marketing abroad
The number of tourist arrivals in our region continues to rise which proves its attractiveness.
People (repeatedly) to introduce you to Flanders, and its renowned art cities
some regions and Brussels requires continuous effort. The development of new forms of
The tourism sector is dynamic. The sector deserves a more forceful approach to marketing and
the necessary participation in the policy.

971.

Tourism Flanders marketing approach must be based in the first place
of the three macro-destinations: art cities, the coast and the Flemish regions. The
international marketing by Tourism Flanders with its four product lines
(eating, drinking and dining culture, heritage and art, fashion, cycling and cycling culture) may
the marketing of the destinations do not compromise.

972.

Globalisation poses for Flanders as a small destination both
threat and an opportunity. So we should not miss the boat from the emerging countries.
sp.a put the overseas marketing of Tourism Flanders reinforced here on in.
Intra-European alliances offer significant opportunities.

973.

With Brussels as tractor Flanders, as the heart of Europe, to further intensify
MICE tourism (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) go
profiling. The cities of Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp and Leuven play here
starring but also other central cities have great strengths in this area. Next
a targeted marketing approach, we also build the MICE infrastructure further.

974.

sp.a put event with a strengthened policy further Flanders on the map as
trendsetting and contemporary area. Through intense collaboration and targeted actions
from Tourism Flanders including large music festivals we can
Flanders as a destination promote better.

We encourage the critical sector
We continue to support the start-up of the value of tourism projects in Flanders and
Brussels. The incentive programs remain a good instrument.

219

975.

The stimulus programs start from effective strategic plans. This is
important to focus the resources of the Flemish government on the effective
priorities from below and in cooperation between the local public and
private actors are formulated. In addition, we propose a mixed
advisory together for all incentive programs. This ensures a large
involvement and broad support of the tourism sector and projects
that meet real needs of the tourists.

976.

Besides the three stimulus programs focused on the macro-destinations
we also develop a flexible way projects throughout Flanders.

We invest in the tourist entrepreneurship
Nearly 8 percent of the entrepreneurs in Flanders is working in the tourism sector. This
entrepreneurs deserve a service-oriented government. We know accreditations and licenses
faster and ensure that subsidies will go to the right projects. The improvement of the
quality of the sector and administrative simplification go together perfectly.

977.

All levels of government working together to battle a strong supportive policy
conduct that entrepreneurs in the tourism sector support and services offering
to undertake.

978.

In tourism we tackle unfair competition from home and
abroad.

979.

We reserve the Accommodation Act to promote the quality of accommodation, too
streamline and monitor. We evaluate the associated administrative
rigmarole.

980.

The tourism sector is the sector par excellence where creativity and entrepreneurship
converge in terms of products, services and marketing. Tourism
Flanders helps the innovation capacity in the sector and to boost innovation
turn on.

981.

sp.a choose a tourism sector which cultivates and promotes sustainability.

Tourism nobody out
Socialist Party stands for social tourism policy. Everyone should have a chance at redemption and at
off; especially young, the disadvantaged and people with disabilities or reduced
mobility.

982.

In recent years we realized that about 30 000 extra people the way
found for an inexpensive vacation by the Holiday Participation. spa
would like to reach more people, even in economically difficult times. We
therefore build the Holiday Participation farther out so more people
in poverty this may appeal. We are working on a larger
220

awareness of the Centre and of more promotion and awareness
social tourism to the private sector. In addition, we are aiming for the widest possible
diversity in the offer.
983.

We continue to invest in the rollout of Rap Step across Flanders and
reach as many people in poverty. We are looking for potential
coordination between Rap Step on and roll out the Uitpas.

984.

Accessible tourism nobody out. sp.a supports the development of
initiatives to improve accessibility for persons with disabilities and with a
to promote reduced mobility. We are working on raising awareness and
promotion round recognition 'Tourism for All' - with accompanying subsidies
and accessibility labels on the whole tourism sector. Accessibility
remains an important focus for tourism investment. For the sector
This creates opportunities to extend the tourist season.

985.

Young people also deserve an adequate size, quality and affordable supply.
sp.a put the catch-up operation in respect of the accommodation infrastructure for young people
further and monitors the quality of existing and future offerings.

We commemorate 100 years of the Great War
The project of the Great War 2014-2018 provides not only an ideal framework for the history and
universal message of peace to give lasting echoes but also more international
attract visitors.

986.

To require sustained effort of the eve of the commemoration
government, the private sector and individuals this tourism potential on a
sustainable use manner, even after 2018. Here we lose the symbolic and
social ambitions in mind.

987.

To anchor of World War I heritage sustainability, we are committed to the full
to the UNESCO dossier initiated by the current Government of Flanders to good
bringing end.

988.

As part of the commemorations we encourage youth to their own
history to know. The next four years puts Tourism Flanders than
also in the tangible create their own piece of history through schools,
youth clubs and youth movements. The war story needs a
personal way and told to be polite without history
politicize and always linked to the European idea of ​​peace.

5.6 Everybody access to quality media
Free, critical and pluralistic media are essential for well functioning democratic
society. Media provide citizens with the information they need, providing them with opinions,
critical voices, socializing and relaxation. Media also allow a retort.
221

Therefore, it is essential that any person, without exception, has access to a diverse and
quality media offerings. And that he has the skills to deal with the media supply.
Journalism occupies a very important place within the media. For these new media, the opportunity to
give to fulfill their role in democracy, they should be able to work sufficiently independent.
Simultaneously, the government should provide a framework for fair competition between
to enable media players to quality, pluralism and diversity of supply, including
journalistic offerings, are complementary.
Media is a broad term. Traditionally involves radio, television and print. More and more, however, see
we expand the boundaries of the concept of media to the Internet, social media and games. Also the
Distributors have gained much importance.
The internet provides many opportunities to offer media and share. The
ubiquitous digital media bring opportunities for more community involvement in
their own social network and beyond. One down side is that people are vulnerable
For example, harassment and violation of their privacy. Recent scandals involving
privacy breach by Google and Facebook show the need for a clear framework
focuses the data for any reason be held and by whom.

989.

Free, pluralistic and critical media are essential to a democratic
society. sp.a therefore wants to pursue a policy that on the one hand
ensures independence of the media and on the other hand contributes to a
diverse and high quality range is still possible by public and private players and this
for everyone in Flanders.

990.

Achieving a quality offering is reflected in particular in the
Stimulating diversity, creativity and innovation of the offering,
attention to the importance of deontology and ethics. A
support policy therefore remains necessary. For the realization of
quality Flemish TV series, we reinforce the Media Fund. To control the growth
to boost the gaming sector in Flanders and innovative
realize education through educational games, the Game Fund receives more
resources. To blend innovate the media sector, there is a role
for the Media Innovation MiX.

991.

Social diversity in terms of gender, ethnicity, ideology
belief and disability should be reflected in the media. In the
future contract with the public broadcaster remains a diversity
spearhead, so that everyone who recognizes in Flanders live in his / her VRT.
Also private media are encouraged to pay closer attention to
a diversity policy that makes a difference. In addition, particular attention
are for a non-stereotyped images. Diversity is also a concrete
Action by the employment policies of the Flemish media.

992.

Media pluralism is very important in a democracy. sp.a opposes further,
unbridled media concentration. Monitoring should make clear whether a
222

increasing concentration does not lead to impoverishment of the content
product diversity.
993.

The viability of the creative sector is paramount. This implies that we
fight for balanced relations between the public and private
media players. We call for cooperation between the various actors and
act against unhealthy balance of power between media players.

994.

sp.a recognizes the importance of the Flemish broadcasters in the media landscape. Therefore
we know the Flemish broadcasters invest in Flemish productions and a
percentage to bring Flemish productions, guaranteed
distribution services.

995.

sp.a believes in the creative talent in Flanders. It is important that individuals
their talents to flourish in correct working conditions and that there is space
for large and small players. We are therefore focusing on talent management and
support for training. Teglijk we ensure a fair and transparent
right acquisition.

996.

Every citizen is entitled to access to quality and pluralistic media offering. sp.a therefore make media accessible to everyone at an affordable
and simple way. All quality news may disappear in no case behind
expensive pay walls. This would lead to an unacceptable new social divide.
The linear VRT television offerings therefore remain freely accessible via DVB-T. The
VRT websites, including deredactie.be not disappear behind a pay wall.

997.

Every citizen is entitled to an Internet connection. This basic internet belongs
from the fundamental right to receive information. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly difficult
to gather vital information to form an opinion, a social network
build or seek work without having access to the Web. This basic internet
is ensured in practice by everyone a minimal connection to home
provided.

998.

sp.a defends the principle of net neutrality. This principle ensures that the
internet network is for everyone. It ensures that no dual Internet
created with both an elitist, expensive and fast internet and the other a
delayed basis internet.

999.

sp.a against the unauthorized sale of personal information, or
rampant and opaque and track parts. Therefore, a clear
framework agreements based on fairness and transparency important. sp.a supports
fully the recent initiatives in the European Parliament that the privacy
European Internet protects users from new types of online infringement
by companies or governments. Only when an interference with the privacy of the
Internet user is strictly necessary in a democratic society, it is
keeping private information surf permitted. sp.a implements the
new European privacy laws in a manner that of the surfer and privacy
Telephone consumer protection as well as possible. The parliament must control
the police and the intelligence services concerning the strengthening
223

General monitoring of society (in contrast to the targeted
monitoring of certain individuals or groups). The sp.a wishes expressly
to oppose an overall general monitoring of all online traffic or
actions by intelligence agencies whose data are for years
kept to himself afterwards to retrieve any specific information
but where meanwhile a mass of data totally innocent people
were collected.
The media Centered
The media user is central to media policy. The media contribute optimally to the
inform, empower and entertain users. We talk knowingly about the 'user', in
Instead of the 'consumer' as a media user is more than a passive consumer.

1000.

sp.a wants users are able to find their way in the overwhelming
media offerings. To this end, requires a number of skills that are not always clear
come. We teach anyone that media skills. Here, an important role
reserved for the knowledge Mediawijs.be. This center has an opportunity
to further develop its operations. In this way, the many organizations
in the field to support their work to the user with higher quality and more
more to carry out strength.

1001.

Particular attention in the teaching of media skills goes to the
children and youngsters. They must be fully and safely
can develop on the web.

1002.

We also pay sufficient attention to vulnerable groups such as seniors,
people living in poverty and people with disabilities. It is important to
other sectors also implement media literacy. We think especially of
welfare and integration.

1003.

Media literacy getting an anchored place in education. Both from
emancipatory as from a pedagogical perspective, it is necessary that such
competencies are contained and thus anchored in the goals of the
(compulsory) schooling. We devote explicit attention in the
teacher training and in-service training offerings for teachers. Also, in the
education programs outside education people get growth and development opportunities
on media literacy.

1004.

sp.a put permanently on making more accessible to media for persons
with visual or hearing impairment, also in Flemish Sign Language.

1005.

Everyone should have access to the media. This also means the access
guarantee for those who do not have digital TV subscription. sp.a Advocates
an analogue switch-off only occurs when at least 95 percent of the
Flemish population has a digital TV subscription.

224

A strong public broadcaster
sp.a advocates a strong public broadcaster that is for everyone and in which everyone
recognize. VRT operates community strengthening through its own operations and through its supply. The
Public broadcasting has the opportunity to develop all relevant media platforms. She
retains a mixed financing.

1006.

The public broadcaster is the public service center, ie:
news, current affairs, education, arts and culture and diversity. One of the essential
tasks of VRT is to pay attention to what is in a commercial
media environment less obvious is discussed, such as investigative journalism,
coverage of minor sports and the arts. VRT focuses on social
responsibility and cooperation.

1007.

The public broadcaster continues next one and Canvas offer a third network.
Thus children are guaranteed on an ad-free and qualitatively
uninterrupted supply. In this way, continues to offer a tailor-made for and by
young people is guaranteed, as well as a more extensive range in the field of
culture and small sports.

1008.

VRT market reinforcing works in respect of the private players on the
media market. To this end, cooperative VRT opposes other players, by
innovate together, by cooperating with the press, and, finally,
by investing in innovative, creative productions in the Flemish
audiovisual production sector.

1009.

The VRT archives is further digitized, preserved and made accessible for
education and the general public. The Flemish Institute for Digital Archiving
and unlocking the Audiovisual Heritage (VIAA), founded in 2013, it is a
important and necessary partner. VIAA get in the next policy period
a structural anchoring, with the necessary financial stability.

High quality information to a wide audience
Freedom of information, both for the providers and the recipients, is a crucial good. Not
Just as an individual human right, but also in the interest of democracy. The digital revolution
Journalism has changed radically. Never circulated much information as today. People
much more than before, have the ability to self to spread information or there
receive. That information must flow quality information sufficient opportunities and to
get to a large audience. This is information that comes professional, which
is reliable and balanced, or who would not publicly without professional journalism.

1010.

sp.a operates a policy of quality in journalism supports. This implies that
both attention goes to the needs of our media companies, as to which of
the individual journalists who work there. For media companies, this means
a lasting investment, training and support innovation in terms of pluralism
225

and quality of the new offer. For journalists we strive for good
working conditions. sp.a emphasizes the importance of a properly functioning
MediAcademie with an extensive after-school training offer
media professionals, and in the further development and embedding of social
charter of the audiovisual sector, which receives an extension to the written
press sector.
1011.

The low rates of VAT for newspapers and discount rates for the postal service,
Important forms of government that keep newspapers
cheap when people arrive. sp.a move beyond these measures so fascinating
newspapers are created and distributed at an affordable price. sp.a goes
conversation about the conditions that may be attached to these benefits
coupled to anchor for example, proper working conditions.

1012.

sp.a create fiscal space for supporting digital newspapers and
new high-quality journalism projects. This also applies to the
Support high-quality but economically unprofitable
investigative journalism, including through the Pascal Decroos Fund.

1013.

Socialist Party is in favor of permanently anchoring the Code for the Council
Journalism and the recognition of the Press Council, and the
editorial independence and eligibility requirements of
new media.

Radio and regional broadcasters, near you
1014.

sp.a recognizes the unifying role that local radio stations in society. A
new FM radio frequency plan guarantees an offer in which for each
listener's taste. sp.a is committed to an economically viable radio sector. The
potential range and scale of local radio must be sufficiently large
are.

1015.

Radio is an excellent medium for creative self-expression by young people.
Young people who want to (learn to) make radio, can count on support.

1016.

Local and regional news, close to the people, is very important. Regional
television is very accessible and has to play an important role here. The
regional broadcasters should seize the new legal framework and local
to bring regional news in a way that all sections of the population
appeals. They need to reorganize itself, where necessary, with a view to
maximum efficiency, and good viewing and ratings.

226

7 EVERYONE DOING MEE
7.1 Introduction: Living together with mutual respect
When you walk the streets of our cities and towns, then falls rapidly the enormous
diversity of our population, young and old, male and female, old and newcomers, and with
without disabilities. They are all faces of our society. This diversity is an asset,
but also a challenge. It makes our world more interesting and richer, but at the same time
complex and challenging. Too often, people with a different background in the next
Instead of each other and we believe in sterile terms of 'us' versus 'them'. We apply this model
of suspicion, populism and exclusion, and resolutely opt for a model of coexistence with
mutual respect for each other's individuality.
We strive for a world where everyone can be themselves and can pursue his happiness. Only at
mutual respect for each other's individuality, people are willing to participate in society
and to contribute to the welfare state. It is unacceptable that women are still a fifth
earn less than men. We do not accept that people have access to a dancing
be refused or not getting a job, just because of their skin color, their religious
conviction or the birthplace of their parents. We tolerate it not for two guys who
street hand in hand physically or verbally attacked. And too often is a handicap
restrictions in our society. sp.a shall therefore hard against discrimination based on
gender, skin color, ethnic background, religion, sexual orientation, age or
handicap.
Central to our approach is that everyone living in our country, shares in both rights and duties
associated with our welfare state. Who should not stay in our country, we prepare to return
times. Of those who await a decision on their residence, we strengthen
resilience. A resistance directed towards a sustainable future, either in our country or in the
country of origin.
sp.a not just want a good life for everyone in our country, but also for parents and their children
elsewhere in the world. A world where some people go forward and others backward state
quiet. Such a model we want. We take it that is still 1.4 billion people in today
extreme poverty, while the powers of the hundred richest people in the world together
Poverty can terminate four times. We do not tolerate human rights in many places
violated and that millions of people suffer today under the threat of
armed conflict. sp.a addresses the problems that lie at the basis of conflicts and crises,
by focusing on global economic and social development. We save our earth much
possible and give everyone equal opportunity to develop themselves. We control
refugee flows better and absorb more refugees in resettlement programs once a
crisis situation arises. This put Belgium and Europe is an important step towards further
realization of a common European asylum and migration.

227

7.2 The fight against discrimination: everyone is equal
All the people in our society are equal. We stand for a society where everyone
be yourself. Only with mutual respect for each other's individuality everyone is willing to
participate in society and contribute to the welfare state. sp.a would like hard
action against discrimination based on gender, age, skin color, ethnic background,
belief, sexual orientation or disability. Discrimination in employment, at school, in
nightlife, by the police on the housing market or other areas is unacceptable.
We fight with all possible means. The thoughts in our country are free, but concrete
actions may not lead to exclusion or incitement to hatred and violence. We go for a
anti-discrimination policy with teeth. For the concrete measures on discrimination
labor market and combat the housing market, we refer to the elements in that particular
part of the election. The other resolutions are listed below.

1017.

We expect much of the Inter-federal Centre for Equal Opportunities and the
Fight against Discrimination and Racism in early 2014 thanks Socialist Party was founded.
This Centre will be different from today, may also take legal action against
breaches of the regional legislation. We want the existing hotlines
Discrimination be strengthened as local branches of this Centre. We strive
to accessible reporting and therefore support the active
publication of these hotlines. When reporting discrimination is
important to work permanently with the society, which often
receive notifications. The proximity of local reporting also supports local
driving in an equal opportunity and anti-discrimination policy.

1018.

Reports of discrimination at the Inter-federal Centre should consistently
be followed. sp.a want the Centre for this purpose legally binding
can perform practical texts. When these field tests on suspect
point of discrimination, the Centre then start conciliation
and / or they went to court. Moreover, there is a higher priority needed for the
prosecution of racist or discriminatory actions.

1019.

In early 2014 was also the federal center - which focuses on migration,
foreigners' fundamental rights and the fight against human trafficking - above
font held. However, fundamental rights are not just a 'federal'
assignment. sp.a would merely ask the Centre 'interfederal' is.

1020.

Discrimination in the hospitality industry is unacceptable: everybody has whatever ethnic and cultural origin, gender, sexual orientation or disability café, restaurant or
can go to a dance. We generalize the system of mandatory
reporting incidents to the local police and compulsory surveillance for all
catering businesses with doormen. This allows their version of the security guards
Facts do and they are more protected from unfounded complaints, while
Victims get an objective handed when they appeal
can make a complaint to the police.

228

1021.

The government should lead by example. While diversity in the
government is gradually rising, women in management, ethnic
minorities and persons with disabilities are significantly under-represented at
government services. Reducing instead of existing targets or
measurement methods to adapt, Socialist Party wants more ambitious targets for the import and
flow to the government. To achieve these targets, vacancies can
For example, to communicate more specific target groups or
HR managers can be more sensitized. At the
evaluation of senior officials are examined to what extent they
achieve targets of their entity.

1022.

When government functions, there is a distinction between contractual and statutory
functions. While the open contractual features for everyone, come to
statutory functions (often with better working conditions) only the citizens
European Economic Area qualify. We want also registered
functions, where these do not involve exercise of public authority,
without nationality restriction be open to anyone who at the
meets job requirements.

1023.

sp.a want a diversity policy with binding targets is as clause
included in public procurement and management agreements. Whosoever
sentenced excluded for breaches of discrimination law
of procurement and management agreements, unless they
can show they have improved their personnel convincing.

1024.

Research indicates that involve certain selection tests undesirable effects
for candidates of foreign origin (this is 'adverse impact'). Governments
should raise awareness about this issue and if necessary through legislation
this form of reducing discrimination. In his own selections, the Flemish
government provide adapted selection methods.

1025.

Everyone has the right to his or her cultural identity in its democratic
experience insight. Elevating a monocultural Flemish, Belgian or
another identity to a political principle leads to a narrow, exclusive
nationalism. Identities are multiple and overlapping. As long as one is willing
to participate in a democratic way to our shared society
everyone should feel committed to what he / she wants.

3.7 Investing in cohabitation
Too often, people with a different background beside rather than with each other and
we think in sterile terms of 'us' versus 'them'. These fault lines undermining solidarity. There
no one is better. We apply this model of social segregation and exclusion. We
just want to actively invest in living together better. Instead of focusing on the differences between
people, sp.a wants to strengthen social cohesion and solidarity by focusing on the values ​​and
standards that everyone must share in our society. We want 'us' and 'them' overcome by the

229

creation of a new 'us'. We can do this through a civic education course in the
education, community-based activities and by supporting associations.
1026.

sp.a favors the introduction of a general course on
citizenship, philosophy and ethics in education. Put in that box
we young democratic and intercultural attitudes and skills and
we teach them the basic elements of the different religions. This
sociocultural box next to the existing ideological
courses are offered. Let the concrete implementation of this burgerschapsvak
we obviously care about the autonomy of the governing bodies and the
teachers.

1027.

We strive through community initiatives and local civil society to better relationships
among the population in a municipality or a city. That is about the
meeting between both low and high educated, old and newcomers,
young and old, as among many other groups. In the neighborhoods
people can forge new bonds that include other forms of solidarity
support behavior. Preferably, these community initiatives have a broader
corporate purpose (such as neighborhood-based social employment, child care,
sports, city excuse gardens and neighborhood participation).

1028.

The club is an excellent place to learn to deal with diversity.
We support associations for ethnic minorities, homosexuals,
women and people with disabilities. These constrictions often get
disadvantaged minorities from their social isolation and form a bridge
to schools, emergency services, government and the rest of society. We
strongly believe in the emancipation from below. Encourage, through targeted subsidies
we also cooperation between associations. Meeting and open discussion
are central. Sports clubs provide an excellent opportunity to
people with different ethnic backgrounds together in a positive way
to bring. We also want to encourage them to strive for diversity
their membership recruitment initiatives to this end and therefore financial, logistics and
methodical support.

1029.

Unknown makes unloved. We argue for a nuanced and accurate
portrayal in the media on gender and diversity, migration, people
disabilities, the elderly, homosexuals and other minority groups in Flanders. The media
have a balanced reflection of the population in their
come workforce. In both entertainment and informative programs
Moreover, there must be attention to this balanced representation
and a differentiated imaging. At the public broadcaster, the
Progress in these areas monitored annually by an external, independent
organization. Private media are through awareness and targeted subsidies
stimulated to support diversity.

230

4.7 Women and men are equal
On virtually all social fields, women as a group are still a disadvantaged
position compared with men. This is a fundamental injustice that results
it is not any talent optimally developed and deployed in our society. A society
where women and men participate equally groups, is there anyone better.
1030.

Everyone is equal, but women and men often are treated differently.
Just look at the ad, where women and men still like creatures
other planets be treated. Toys for girls is pink and often
focused on caring. Boys do not join them. That romp in the garden,
while girls changing their diapers baby toys. Very sits society
full of pitfalls like this. It is therefore important that we continue to focus on the
making a gender click (www.genderklik.be).

1031.

In 2012 was in Flemish schools a charter signed by all
education partners. With this charter, all schools commit themselves to an integral
to implement policies for gender and LGBT themes. From school year 2014-2015
Various experimental schools set up a gender-neutral and
perform gay conscious policy. In the classroom, on the playground, in the staff room. spa
wants after that school year the project will be evaluated and adjusted if necessary
deepened and extended to all schools.

The socio-economic position of women lags behind that of men. However, study
more women off to colleges and universities. Often with better results than their
male classmates. Still committed to too little in the world of work. Often decide
women to work less, or (temporarily or otherwise) even to stop work completely
to include family care responsibilities. All too often it is thereby not realize the consequences
longer term, a divorce or upon retirement. Care record for a family is naturally
not the problem. There later be punished, that's it.

1032.

By notarial clauses that were in the previous Flemish legislature
worked out, some can be financially detrimental effects to be addressed. spa
wants to consider what legislative measures are needed in inequalities
to update this connection path.

1033.

It could not be that women for the same job and the same number of hours of work yet
always earn less than their male colleagues. To overcome the problem by
enterprise to visualize, each discloses the relevant
Data in the social balance sheet. The differences in fringe benefits
identifying them by company. Companies that do not work with
gender-neutral job classifications or companies that discriminate in the
providing supplementary benefits or programs can not
receive aid.

1034.

Combining work and family we improve the right to parental leave
expand. The benefit will be increased and taxed as income, so that it effectively
231

inclusion of the parental leave for low earners and single-parent families
a real right. We promote parental leave for men so that they are
more use of it. We effectively give single parents the right two
take additional months. We encourage the social partners and employers to
have together focus on work-life balance of employees through
flexible working hours (eg flexible working hours), a progressive
IT environment for home workers and a proactive competency policy
polyvalent employees, work colleagues can take over. We have
an eye for potential negative impacts and encourage a participative
development of these schemes.
1035.

The award of alimony is optimized by DAVO (Service
Maintenance Recovery) advanced and more efficient to work.
We draw the income limit to receive advances from DAVO dramatically
and raise these advances.

1036.

In health care we devote more attention and resources to
conditions that affect only women (such as for example, endometriosis, a
disease of the uterus).

1037.

To meet the Belgian legislation feminisation of councils
of governance which there is a presence since 2017 of at least 1 / 3rd
women in the boards of directors of listed companies and the
European Directive on the presence of at least 40 per cent women
boards of listed companies by 2020 we set a
action plan. In the medium term we must have the ambition to go
a 50/50 ratio of women and men on the boards. A series
measures to bring this ambition into practice as soon as possible in Belgium.
Companies must demonstrate how they give this commitment meaning.

1038.

At present, the protection against discrimination based on sex yet
not organized in accordance with our international obligations. The Statute of the
current Institute for the Equality of Women and Men does not answer
the requirements of independence. There is a gap in the area of ​​the
fight against discrimination on grounds of gender at community and
regional powers. Just as has happened in the meantime to CEOCR wants sp.a that
Governments also on next generation reach a joint solution.

5.7 Gays and Transgender: everyone can be themselves
Maybe it seems like gay in Belgium and Flanders is not an issue anymore. Although we
Here and there still need to improve our legislation, we can be proud of and reason for us
legal framework. Within that framework, we are indeed among the leaders. Unfortunately, you can with a few
Laws not undo what for decades has been distorted. LGBT people are still
faced with a lack of acceptance, exclusion, deprivation and even violence. The
therefore remains difficult to encourage themselves as LGBT people: at school, as a student, at work, on the
police station, where do you want to return or in the nursing home in which you recorded.
232

Socialist Party stands for a society in which everyone can be themselves. Only with mutual respect for
each other's individuality, everyone is willing to participate in society and contribute to the
welfare state.
The acceptance of LGBT people remains an important social
challenge. At all policy levels and domains, there is need for initiatives that social
position and promote acceptance of gay people. In public policy initiatives and research should
Furthermore attention must be paid to 'forget', excluded and vulnerable
subgroups. For example, there is little research on the situation of socio-economic level, in terms of relational violence and in terms of health of lesbians, while
nonetheless represent half of the gay population. Also to more vulnerable groups such as older
gays and lesbians, gays with disabilities, ethnic minority LGBT people we need in the LGBT policies but also pay sufficient attention to other areas.
Finally, we must not forget that elsewhere in the world both in law and in
social sphere particularly dangerous times for gays.

1039.

We solve the problems surrounding the adoption leave for LGBT people and make it
possible for them-parent mothers to admit their child, just like dad's
can.

The Act on transsexuality from 2007 requires that people have serious medical interventions
undergo and must be irreversibly infertile before they officially sex
can change. This is contrary to the Yogyakartaprincipes - drafted a set of principles
by international human rights experts - who say that no one may be required
to undergo medical treatment before that person receives legal recognition for her or
his gender identity.

1040.

We apply the law on transsexuality to so that it is no longer in conflict with
the relevant human rights provisions. On official documents, there is the option
to indicate no gender.

1041.

Principle, we found that men who have sex with men may Blood
give. The same conditions and exclusion period because of risky behavior
should apply to give blood.

1042.

In 2012 was in Flemish schools a charter signed by all
education partners. With this charter, all schools commit themselves to an integral
to implement policies on gender and LGBT themes. From school year 2014-2015
Various experimental schools set up a gender-neutral and
perform gay conscious policy. In the classroom, on the playground, in the staff room. spa
wants after that school year the project will be evaluated and adjusted if necessary
deepened and extended to all schools.

1043.

The gay and (trans) gender theme we include in the curricula of all
ages, including higher education. The educational umbrella organizations and
233

School communities need to encourage individual teachers to a
culture to create openness around the LGBT or gender variant of
students and teachers. The theme should be part of the integral
teacher training. There is need for education and awareness about the
gender issues. Official documents on the schools should be gender neutral
are made.
1044.

In 2012 nearly 13 000 athletes took part in the London Olympics.
Just under 20 were openly gay. The taboo to encourage themselves in the sport amateur and professional - is very large. Therefore, in 2012 with all
football partners developed an action plan with very specific measures. sp.a wants
in other sports similar plans.

1045.

LGBT youth often think of suicide and take more
suicide attempts than their heterosexual peers. This applies even more to
young lesbians, bisexual and transgender girls. In welfare policy in the
general and suicidal policy in particular should pay particular attention
to be in these groups.

1046.

Lesbians are less easy way to preventive medicine and
therefore have specific problems in the area of ​​sexual health (including
an increased risk of breast and cervical cancer). When setting up
actions in the area of ​​sexual health, there is a need for specific attention to them
and tell them for example to emphasize the importance of gynecological
research.

1047.

In 2012 the Transgender Info Point was founded. It has since its value
proved. It receives daily questions of who, directly or indirectly
with transgenderism gets involved: individuals themselves, parents, family, friends,
colleagues, employers. In short, everyone relies on the Info Point. sp.a wants
this Infopunt also continue in the next legislature.

1048.

Cooperation within the framework of the recently launched HIV plan continues
so this plan is carried out optimally.

1049.

sp.a wants the interfederal action against homo- and transphobia in the
next legislature further runs. This means, among other things, that all
relevant levels of government officials who are recruited or identified
implementation of this plan in practice deliver.

1050.

Persons because of their sexual orientation, gender identity or expression of
deprived of their liberty, prosecuted, convicted or mentally or physically tortured
be should be internationally recognized as a political prisoner for sp.a
or political refugee. The efforts that Belgium already provided in the area of
specialization and expertise on sexual orientation or gender identity or expression in the recognition of political refugees, we must preserve.

1051.

We have in our own country there is quite a lot of good laws and initiatives that
pursuing equal treatment of gay people. We are actively cooperating for this match
234

Treatment also do find acceptance in countries where equal rights
coming tribulation. sp.a wants Belgium to the EU Directive on Discrimination
defend and pressure continues to exert to get on the agenda and make them them
approve. All text, treaties or international guidelines discrimination
forbid, should undergo sp.a sexual orientation and gender identity or expression explicitly include as unlawful discrimination grounds. Finally,
sp.a that governments in our country equal treatment of gays and
gender variant persons record in negotiations and relations with countries
where homosexuality is criminalized or where LGBT and gender variant
people are still persecuted.

Rating 7.6 Sexual and reproductive health and rights
The premise of sp.a for sexuality is that every human being is entitled to the best possible sexual and
reproductive health and the right to her or his sexuality, free of coercion, discrimination
or to experience violence. This immediately implies that sexual health is more than the absence
sex related diseases and prevent risks such as unplanned pregnancies,
sexual behavior and sexually transmitted diseases. All this translates
in a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships.
1052.

sp.a fought along with other progressive forces for a
easy accessibility of contraceptives and safe abortion. We
keep watch over these achievements such as the repayment of contraception
min for 21 year olds and take further steps in the quality framework
of abortion.

1053.

We prohibit commercial surrogacy.

1054.

We prohibit sexual acts in a caring relationship between a doctor or
other health care provider or therapist and his patient or client.

1055.

We ensure that everyone has access to unbiased information
sexual health and sexual health services. GPs
thereby have a crucial function. They should have a respectful with their patients
conversation can trigger sexual dysfunctions, appropriate
contraception, adequate detection of STIs and signs of sexual
transgressive behavior in order to promote sexual health.
Attention to these issues in the training and retraining of general practitioners is required.

1056.

Also, children and adolescents have a right to information, education and customized
services in the field of sexual health. We need sufficient
paying attention to their needs. Institutions and organizations in the integral
youth, child, youth, the health sector, the sports sector
and education must develop a policy that's sexual development
children and youth promotes and contributes to better prevention, detection and
addressing sexual behavior. The Framework and Sexuality
Policy "that Sensoa elaborated, provides the ideal guide.
235

1057.

Other vulnerable groups such as people with disabilities,
refugees, newcomers or people with psychiatric problems,
right to information, education and customized services in the field of
sexual health. And in these sectors there is a need for a tool
policy to give in terms of sexuality shape.

1058.

We ensure that the component sexual health actually
is treated in integration courses.

1059.

Specifically relating to new arrivals, asylum seekers and undocumented
residency status we ensure access to mainstream services. Thus, they can also
count on a safe abortion, pregnancy, childbirth, prevention, treatment
STIs, vital HIV treatment and appropriate relief
sexual violence.

1060.

We concretize the coordinated interfederal HIV plan 2014-2019 and run
it on all levels involved. In addition, we strive to prevent new HIV cases as much as possible. Because HIV occurs mainly in Flanders
at gay men and Sub-Saharan African migrants we put specific
actions for both groups. We also continue to support organizations working in the
ground up interventions for sex workers or people taking drugs
Injecting.

1061.

Who has HIV should not only monitored medical, and psychosocial problems
are supported. This requires, among other customized information specialist
advice and peer support. We remain committed to this because it lowers the
barriers to regular and specialized care. It is also important because it
supports people living with HIV in their adherence and their intention to secure
lovemaking. So we avoid new infections.

1062.

People with HIV are regularly confronted with difficulties and even
discrimination in terms of access to general medical services,
miscellaneous insurance or work. Solidarity campaigns and training in companies
schools, services and assistance organizations have unnecessary fear and
eliminate ignorance and thus contribute to an inclusive environment where people
HIV no longer stigmatized or discriminated against.

1063.

In the context of health Flanders has sufficient resources
continue to provide for a partner organization in the field of sexual health.

1064.

We continue to invest in research in the field of sexual and reproductive
health and rights.

1065.

Sexual and reproductive health and rights, including the approach
HIV / AIDS and access to safe abortions and pregnancy follow-up,
must be a priority for the Flemish and federal international
collaboration. Thus, we renew the cooperation agreement with UNFPA,
UNAIDS, WHO and the Global Fund to
Fighting AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) at the federal level ....
236

We also remain committed to the development of expertise on sexual and
reproductive rights and health in the relevant departments. For example, there may at the
assessment and monitoring of development projects and programs, including
outside the health sector, more attention go.

7.7 In ordinary life with a disability
Persons with disabilities without restrictions fully participate in society,
it strives to sp.a. Belgium ratified in 2009 the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons
with disabilities. Core elements of the treaty inclusion and self-determination. We need now
deed to the word. Like everyone want people with disabilities in a good freedom
extend life. Like everyone else, they have talents, hopes and dreams. Like everyone
they want to study, work, sports or live alone. Like everyone else, they want with friends at cafe
go, attend a concert, participate in community life. That takes effort. Of the
person with disabilities, but also of society. Society needs to so
organize that people with disabilities can also participate.
Therefore, our society must be made fully accessible. Because no one should experience thresholds.
The principle of universal design makes this clear. However, this goes beyond just physical
accessibility. The barriers to information and participation should disappear. Integral
Accessibility is essential for an inclusive, non-discriminatory society.
Guests often entails additional concerns. Each of us can with Disabilities
to be confronted. Nobody expects a handicap at the birth of a child or thinking about
a permanent disability after a serious accident or illness. It happens more than anyone thinks.
According to recent research by the European Commission, 1 in 6 people in the European
Union mild to severe disabilities. Which costs more and need extra care we need as a society
wear in solidarity.
The lives of people with disabilities, like everyone touched by many domains.
Many of the principles in this text, therefore, find translation in other chapters. We are then
also reflect on persons with disabilities in other areas: employment, education, housing, mobility,
culture, sports, media and discrimination.

A society tailored including people with disabilities
People with disabilities are people like you and everyone else. They also want to just live. A
warm society does not exclude people. And may participate in the society is a
human right.
1066.

The UN Convention is the basis for the Flemish, Belgian and European policy
HINTS persons with disabilities. sp.a put these rights in legislation and
policy. With each new regulations and policy will also on its impact
persons with a disability evaluated and justified.

237

1067.

We guarantee an accessible society through the principle of 'Universal
To promote design. " The government here gives a good example. Also for
private public buildings and locations we like the integral accessibility
improve. Therefore, we give developers vouchers with which they
accessibility advice may contact the foundation Accessible Flanders.
For example even more shops and bars available.

1068.

In Flanders, the so-called Accessibility Regulation which provides
terms of new or renovated buildings have a public function
meet. sp.a intends to expand the power of these regulations. Also not planafleesbare, but equally necessary, alterations - such as, for example, the
use of Braille, a blocking ability of automatically closing
deurenof luminous fire alarms - we incorporate into the legislation. We
increase the expertise of those working with the Regulation and expand the
control and sanctioning possibilities.

1069.

The current legislation only provides accessibility requirements for new
or renovated buildings. sp.a want our society to 'short' term
becomes accessible. Therefore we extend the rules with minimum standards
that all existing buildings must comply with special attention to
cinemas and amusement parks. We realize that this is no work that one-two-three
will be realized, but a phased approach.

1070.

Of course it is not sufficient that only buildings are fully accessible. Also
public property and public transport should be. You may be
Nothing with an accessible bakery if you do not hit it. Therefore,
roads, squares, parks and playgrounds are also accessible. sp.a wants
develop mandatory rules that applied in the construction of the public domain
be. Also, each municipality by 2018 an accessibility plan
submit. It municipalities should report on the accessibility and
the solutions they will offer.

1071.

Accessibility is not limited to the physical environment. Government departments and
companies that provide essential services (such as BPost, banks, telecom and
utilities) have all their information in accessible form
make. Particular attention should be given for people with hearing or
visual impairments and persons with intellectual disabilities.

1072.

Government websites should be accessible to people with
handicap. That is already the case today, but often this obligation is not
observed. That must be different and better. sp.a wants the various governments
take measures to ensure stronger this access. It is
also necessary for all other websites that information in Dutch
provide are accessible. At first we want about the
Web designers themselves come to an agreement. If this does not work, it is imperative
necessary regulations. European Socialist Party will also participate pulling the cart.

238

1073.

The government has an exemplary turd in the creation of an integrated
accessible society. Therefore, different governments must of course
all own infrastructure, information and communication for a diverse possible
make public. But equally, the subsidy should be a lever
be. Where we make available community resources
infrastructure seems evident that this new (or renew)
infrastructure not only the basic standards of accessibility Regulation
respects, but pursuing an integral accessibility. Or again: if
events receive subsidies, we also expect everyone
participate. In short, to support the government we may best conditions
Linking that ensure accessibility for all.

1074.

The person with disabilities is the expert par excellence. This expertise should be
structural policies are applied. 'Nothing about us without ons' principle
ensures that persons with disabilities are involved in the policy.
National, Flemish and locally. We advocate that effective advisory boards
for persons with disabilities at local, Flemish and federal level.

A dignified life with a full income
Also, people with disabilities want to work in the first place. Yet it is not always
everyone possible. In that case they have to rely on a replacement income. From the Handi laboratory research at KULeuven from 2012 show that a large proportion of people with a
allowance for persons with disabilities living on an income below the
European poverty line. The current allowances cover the costs of disability
insufficient. No one can live in dignity without a full income.
1075.

People with disabilities need extra support in the labor market.
Employers should make efforts through the implementation of reasonable
adjustments. The allowance for the adaptation of the workplace for
persons with disabilities and the Flemish Support Premium should
help here. Finally, it should also VDAB disability adjusted
provide support.

1076.

People with disabilities who can not work, earn
income security. We must ensure that they enter a
pingpong game between unemployment, sickness or disability specific
benefit. We want to simplify the administrative procedure and the
institutions concerned should exchange the necessary information. We have to
avoid people with disabilities have to wait for months
income.

1077.

We must complete the system of benefits for persons with disabilities
revised. We do this in collaboration with the National Council for Persons
Disability. Each person with a disability must be at least a
have income above the poverty line. Income replacement
compensation (IVT) must be at least above the poverty line. A
Disability should not be the same as living in poverty.
239

1078.

The integration allowance (IT) serves the additional costs of disability to
compensate. It is therefore logical that someone who concession unabridged
reserves, when he or she goes to work or live together.

1079.

The evaluation of the ability to cope with the granting of IT is controversial and
often leads to discrimination. So it is easier for someone in a wheelchair
a mobility restriction to demonstrate than for a person with a
mental disorder. The assessment needs through multidisciplinary evaluation
happen. Not only medical but also social and psychological factors
included. So we avoid discrimination.

1080.

Knowing where you are entitled, is not always easy. Social and tax advantages
associated with disabilities are often spread across many domains
levels of government. Therefore, we advocate one accessible counter where you
accessible information on all the existing benefits. Recognize benefits
we, as is now often the case, the maximum and automatically.

People with disabilities, a social responsibility
Each of us may be faced with a disability. No one predicts the birth of
a child with a disability or permanent disability following an illness or accident. We are all
just as vulnerable. Therefore it is important that we have the extra care that is associated with a handicap
wear in solidarity. Only by taking on this responsibility together, we are confident that we
get help when we need it.
Uncertainty gnaws at people. Further efforts to answer to all care
size offer, remain necessary. The waiting lists are harrowing. Especially parents of children with
restriction is not always immediately ask for a place, but want to be reassured that there is a
place will be when needed. In current systems, this is seldom possible. However this is the
prime example where context-oriented approach - combined with various forms of care -
often leads to solutions that are not necessarily residential.
It is important that we have the person with disabilities at the center. They want to live their own
may determine. It is the person himself, whether or not supported, which is the steering of his or her care
takes on.
1081.

Live in the uncertainty that cares for your child, brother or sister will be there when
required is unacceptable. sp.a wants to develop an investment plan for a real
care guarantee to work out a care guarantee which provides security.

1082.

Support must in the first place, the autonomy of the person with a
increasing disability. The evolution we continue to more self-control. The
funding should always be linked to a person with a disability, and it
or allow her his or her life can organize yourself. Thus we arrive at real
customized care.

1083.

The sector for persons with disabilities must reinvent itself. The current
barriers are customized care in the way. Cooperation between different
sectors (eg. between mainstream services and disability specific care) is needed

240

to give everyone the most appropriate care. When it comes to customization
makes a difference together.
1084.

Caring for a person with a disability is still a social
responsibility that we have to take in solidarity. The government must ensure
adequate supply, which is of high quality and financially accessible. An offer
where social entrepreneurship is central. In the healthcare sector, the importance
the user always comes first.

1085.

When caregivers decide together with the person with a disability to the
care or take a part of it themselves, they must be supported.
This does not absolve the company from its responsibility. Nobody
may be required to take all the care themselves. Nor should the person with a
Guests are required to exhaust its network completely before entry to
to get more appropriate help.

1086.

Social inclusion are essential tools. Today the award is
or repayment of tools much too stiff. The procedure is often long and
complex. In addition, we also need innovations in the tools sector
quickly take to the granting and repayment. By a global
review of the policy tools, anyone who has this need raft
have the necessary and appropriate tools.

Rating 7.8 Ethnic and cultural diversity, value to us
Dutch Language Proficiency
A good command of Dutch is crucial for socio-economic empowerment
and foreigners to live together in diversity. But Dutch to want a language 'and
can 'be, instead of a language of "and should not allowed'. A good command of
Dutch does not mean that foreigners are no longer allowed to teach their native language or customs.
Multilingualism is an asset and not a handicap in our society.
1087.

We support the basic Dutch in the mandatory and integration process
plead to create sufficient educational resources for this purpose. The new
in practice, however, arrangement is not less workable for language-sensitive
speakers. After several failed attempts, they fall by the wayside and be
they literally as 'being taught' branded. In this way, it is
integration program rather an instrument of exclusion rather than inclusion. spa
wants customization: Dutch language courses should at an early stage
combined with another program, work or volunteering. This
flexible pathways give less sensitive language speakers the opportunity to
Dutch on their pace to work with, without them sanctioned
be.

241

1088.

Deliver the welcome offices and the municipal and provincial integration centers
currently locally tailored with an eye to local challenges and
specific profile of the existing migrant communities. We are not
won for the reform aimed at integration and civic sector in a
Flanders wants to push uniform straitjacket and the expertise and the voice of the
society ignores and disappear. Furthermore, the reform will be full of hands
cash costs with the result that fewer people in the field of integration
will work. Any reform of the sector in terms of customization
happen and in consultation with local organizations and civil society.

1089.

A good command of Dutch is crucial to the exercise of a
Job. But not all jobs require the same level in terms of proficiency in the field
of speaking, listening, reading and writing. The current rules for public office
rigid so that they are more of a hindrance than a
form springboard for the integration of foreigners. sp.a wants the language criteria
checking for jobs more job-specific. The government needs the good here
giving example.

1090.

We want to informal learning in volunteer work, at work and in leisure
promote more time. Employers are supported by the government better
courses offer Dutch language or coaching in the workplace. The socio-cultural society will be more encouraged to cross-cultural encounters
organize with Dutch as spoken language.

1091.

sp.a wants the native speakers in a positive way at school, in
after-school care or is dealt with youth without learning
Dutch stand in the way. The earlier such moves begin, the better (eg.
learn counting or singing songs in both Dutch and in other languages
present in the classroom). This is for all children in the classroom, in shelters or on the
playground enrichment.

1092.

We encourage libraries to build a collection of classics from the
Dutch literature translated into other languages ​​(eg. Library of Babel
Antwerp). In this way we bring newcomers into contact with the
Dutch heritage. This is not in the control of Dutch
away. Who reads books, is in any case interested in language and hence in learning
of Dutch.

1093.

We can not expect that newcomers immediately fluent Dutch
speak and understand. For us it is essential that newcomers
basic services free of charge to rely on social interpretation and
translation services (eg. communications to foreign parents of pupils
communication with foreign speaking patients or clients to practitioners,
hospitals or other welfare and healthcare establishments).

242

The value of diversity
Diversity represents a major added value for society. Migrants are often young,
enterprising people who are willing to work hard on a new life elsewhere too
build. They bring original ideas, the knowledge of foreign languages ​​and an extensive, transnational
network along with it. Not infrequently, this translates into a new commercial in poor neighborhoods
Creating hopeful economic dynamism. As a society, the emphasis is on to this potential
to maximize. This might for example efficiently diplomas and competencies
entrants acknowledge to (h). That is not only in the interest of the socio-economic emancipation
of the newcomers themselves. There, the whole society better.

1094.

Too few newcomers the recognition of their foreign credentials. Hereby
we lose as a society much talent. sp.a will continue with our policy
focusing on a smoother, more efficient and more famous recognition procedure
of foreign credentials. To speed up access to the labor market
to achieve, in order to activate more rapidly old and new workers have to
more we harmonize the current recognition system at European level and
extending to third-country diplomas.

1095.

Entrepreneurship of ethnic minorities should further
be encouraged. We note that they find difficult access
capital, regular business networks and relevant government initiatives. Also
the regulations for newcomers often a tangle. It is the task of all
governments to make concrete and understandable measures for all
(candidate) entrepreneurs. In addition, mixed networks may be of
entrepreneurs incorporate a form of sponsorship for newcomers and
disadvantaged, not least to finance and regulation.

The secular society
sp.a guarantees the separation of church and state. That means that the service provision of the
government is based on clear and democratically negotiated rules. At the same time
the separation of church and state means that citizens of their religious or philosophical
conviction may live and propagate. Religious freedom is not absolute freedom stops
where that of the other begins. We should not be tolerant of intolerance. Certainly
radicalization, including the growing Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, religious fanaticism and neo-Nazism, worries us.

1096.

Government buildings should radiate the neutrality of this service.
Therefore in government buildings are no religious or philosophical
signs hung or placed.

1097.

Religious freedom also applies to government officials. sp.a let officials
no function clothing to wear for religious and ideological signs on
to carry the work floor. When well chosen clothes can function there,
depending on the nature of the job and in consultation with staff, account
243

into account the personal preferences of the employees concerned.
Unlike buildings may be people does not neutralize. The
called "apprehension of bias" based on prejudice which the
Government should not yield. The best remedy is mutual prejudices
correct provision of services, through a civil service that is visible to the
diversity within our society reflects.
1098.

In principle we are in favor that students can choose in all freedom
within the school to wear or not religious or philosophical signs.
However, this freedom is subject to a number of conditions, including the
remain visible from the face, participation in organized sports or
cultural lessons and activities, and the rules of safety (when activated
machines) respect.

1099.

In the fight against radicalization will sp.a hateful speeches and forums
detect and sanction. We also want the breeding ground for
remove radicalization. This means that we in the skyrocketing unemployment
certain neighborhoods, the school dropout rate, the structural discrimination and the actual
Tackling segregation.

support only those religious movements that the principles of our
democratic constitutional state endorse. They deserve a
full place in our society.

Rating 7.9 Asylum and migration: a decent life for everyone
People leave not just family, friends and homeland elsewhere all over again
start. Migrants are primarily people who are in search of a better life. Because
Migration is inextricably linked to the unequal distribution of wealth in the world. As long as
there is inequality, as long as there are differences in living standards, as long as there are people who
face repression and armed conflict or environmental disasters, there will be ...
migration. Most migrants do not get far and forced to stay somewhere in the region.
Often in difficult, sometimes in inhumane living conditions. A world where nations
go forward and the other backward, not growing but is still. Such a model we want. We
promote a policy that creates prosperity for migrants seeking a better future.
Both for our society and for the country of origin. That is why we organize ourselves
migration in an equitable manner. We ensure that our asylum and immigration policy
our international policies are coherent and mutually reinforcing. We are dedicated to sustainable development,
244

justice and social, economic and environmental level. We pursue a policy of
disarmament and do battle against poverty. We must do this together, as only then
we can turn the tide.
Besides preventive measures and support in the countries of origin, we want a full
protection policy. Unfortunately we can not accommodate everyone. Our policy must be one of so
the best possible protection.
Poverty can also be a reason to leave a country. Economic migration is not the solution,
but the right use of the talents and creativity of newcomers to innovation and prosperity
create. Economic migration can help people find a job, can labor shortages
Eliminating and thus contribute to economic growth and employment for all. By the way,
who works more quickly is independent, feel better, participates in and contributes to the
society.
At the same time we must not be blind to abuse certain migration channels. Asylum and
related procedures should be no loophole to stay illegally in our country.
Labor should not lead to unfair competition and social fraud. Central to our
approach is that those who are staying in our country, is not considered a migrant, but as a citizen.
That means that those who are staying, shares in both the rights and duties of our welfare state.
Who should not stay in our country, we prepare to return. Of those who wait
a decision on their stay, we want to strengthen the resilience. A focus on resilience
a sustainable future, either in our country or in the country of origin.
Only in this way can everyone be enhanced. Want to progress with your work together
everybody and to the benefit of everyone.
Legal certainty for everyone
The Aliens is an opaque tangle. This lack of transparency leads to improper
use of legal remedies and gives the stranger to be the feeling of arbitrariness
exposed. By increasing the efficiency and quality of the procedures, we can quickly but
Carefully determine who can stay. This provides greater legal certainty and ensures better
collaboration: it provides an anchor for the applicant as well as the migration services. On one hand,
better informed advocates and counselors can provide more accurate advice about which procedure
has (no) chance of success. On the other hand a good understanding will be the probability of a voluntary return
increase.
1102.

We want a thorough rewrite of the migration code. Codification
should pay special attention to vulnerable persons. Uniformity
transparency and ensure equal rights and more legal certainty for both
the migrant and the government.

1103.

Effective access to legal assistance from the arrival and structural
support with quality legal assistance is necessary. It is
essential that foreigners, legal counselors, social workers and all
actors are well aware of the immigration law. A
245

clear information resulting in more accurate and efficient
using existing procedures. It also increases the understanding and acceptance
for (im) possibilities of migration to the litigant.
1104.

Asylum applications have a short-term inside, quality and on an equal
manner to be treated. If the competent authorities in due time appropriate decisions
take, we avoid any incentive for the applicant to stay in Belgium
to stretch.

1105.

Our policy on asylum and migration on the basis of relevant migration information. Therefore, we will invest more in the fullest and most detailed
for data collection. Statistics are broken down by sex.
All actors manage data sources or process regular discussions
and discuss the best possible reporting on migration. Additionally, more
attention and research on the impact of the measures.

We advocate for a humane, full and effective protection
Our protection goes beyond an asylum. Whose nationality has not been determined and
who is considered by any state resident or whose expulsion by
circumstances prevent or inhuman, should have the opportunity to stay legally in our country.
Humanitarian aid will remain for us a moral obligation. Belgium and the European Union catch only
fraction of refugees from war zones that are absorbed by the neighboring countries.
For people seeking international protection, there is virtually no way to
legally to Europe. Our country and the European Union, the whole
managing refugee flows. Apart from assistance to the region we need more refugees
catch through resettlement programs. This put Belgium and Europe an important step towards
the further development of a common European asylum and migration. Same
Asylum procedures and protection standards across the European Union provide for a
balanced distribution of asylum seekers and migrants.
1106.

We endorse the non-refoulement principle (the prohibition of a stranger
return to the country where his or her life or freedom would be threatened).
The Immigration Department, the Commissioner General for the
Refugees and Stateless Persons and the Aliens Litigation Council
conduct a thorough and meticulous research into the risk of a breach of
Article 3 of the ECHR (European Convention on Human Rights) at the effective
expulsion of rejected asylum seekers. Refused asylum seekers for whom there
will still be established that there is a risk of violation of Article 3 ECHR
in case of removal to the country of origin, get a
residence permit.

1107.

The procedure for recognition of the status of stateless should be better. A
efficient procedure offers the possibility to obtain residence status in case
of need for protection or lack of valid alternative accommodation. The CGRS
is responsible for granting the status of stateless and is RVV
in full jurisdiction competent for the profession. Belgium ratifies the UN Convention
1961 limiting statelessness.
246

1108.

On the resettlement of refugees, we call for a more comprehensive and
coordinated European policy. Furthermore, Belgium must structurally
resettlement program to achieve more systematic refugees
resettle. To ensure war refugees access to Belgium, to a
provide quick solution to urgent humanitarian crises and to neighboring countries
relieve from countries at war, we want humanitarian admission procedure
UNHCR (UN High Commission for Refugees of the United
Nations) bets. It means that refugees can happen safely and
get a temporary residence permit for war refugees. For them, we want to
family reunification possible.

1109.

Europe needs its solidarity create a workable system. Except for a
fully-fledged national asylum policies there is an urgent need for a common
European asylum policy. Due to lack of harmonization of asylum policy at
European level there is a very uneven distribution of immigrants across the Member States.
There is better cooperation between the Member States for the
common external borders. Member States' solidarity in the reception of
refugees who arrive there. Asylum policy is the same throughout the Union
implemented manner. There will be a European mechanism for the fair
distribution of asylum applications at the external borders. Belgium plays a
leading role in the European Asylum Support Offices (EASO and EPRA).
These independent centers offer to Member States the tools they need their
asylum systems and improving protection standards.

A quality care and counseling
The asylum seeker must be an optimum composition of the various types of childcare
include that closely matches the needs of the applicant. Pending a decision may
We accommodating asylum seekers and other persons entitled to not leave them to their fate. We call for a
intensive support from their arrival until their return, focusing on sustainable
future. Aliens have faster access to (voluntary) work. Who works state
faster on their feet, feel better, participates in and contributes to our society.
A minority of refugee claims today. Therefore, a forming
effectively and consistently return policy is a necessary cornerstone of any fair
migration. We support the principle of assisted voluntary return, focusing on
sustainable future in the country of origin or another country. Detention and forced expulsion
rarely produce a lasting solution and are just a last link. People who
on the other hand will be a danger to public order, thanks to better cooperation
with the countries of origin, are quickly identified and returned.
1110.

There will be a review of the care model with a short evaluation period
the government allows to identify shelter for asylum seekers the most
is recommended.

1111.
Enough shelters must be there for all care recipients,
adapted to their needs. This shelter is flexible in terms of resources and capacity,
247 so as to respond effectively to ever-changing composition and
inflows.
1112.
Through short vocational courses and information sessions, we want
increase self-sufficiency of asylum seekers. Asylum seekers who in three months
the procedure are granted access to the labor market. For asylum seekers - and to
Expansion anyone who has a valid residence permit or take shelter - is
Volunteering possible.
1113.
We advocate an assisted voluntary return. Voluntary return should
be integrated into an intensive supervision of asylum seekers from the
moment of his asylum application, which includes both a residence and return process.
Voluntary return should not only apply after a negative decision on the
end of an asylum procedure, but needs an ever-present option
remain throughout stay. It is, therefore, best integrated into the
counseling of regular childcare structure. And resettlement
requires close cooperation between the competent authorities. The
cooperation will be included in job descriptions of all involved
actors.
1114.
The offer for voluntary return must be both qualitatively and quantitatively
be extended to all stay seekers. Quality by offering the
streamline various reintegration partners and transparent procedures
to work. Quantitatively by starting new projects in countries
origin or to cooperate with other countries similar

take into account the best interests of the child.
1116.
The detention of families with children in closed centers expressly
excluded by law.
1117.
Confinement in a detention center will only qualify as less

are, must remain the protection of all other fundamental rights
enjoy. For each situation examined whether the detention is disproportionate
to the aim pursued and whether the measure is fair towards the
individual situation. Vulnerable people receive appropriate counseling.
1118.
Foreigners who apply for asylum at the border, the same rights and
access to procedures as other applicants in the territory. Asylum seekers
may not be retained throughout their asylum procedure. Only for
the time required for identification.
248 1119.
The right to an effective remedy and access to quality legal
assistance for foreign nationals in detention must be safeguarded.
1120.
We improve the complaints procedure in detention centers by these independently
create and increase the effectiveness.
1121.
When police persons residing here illegally and endanger
public order forms, arrest, they bring these priorities to a closed

A sustainable solution for (unaccompanied) minors
More and more people leave their country of origin. Most of them come on their own here,
without the protection of a parent or guardian. As a society, we must carefully guard
future of these vulnerable minors. They are the adults of tomorrow and so our
future. We want rapid, fair and quality procedures for minors. With each
decision about staying there left from the needs and best interests of the child.
Procedures involving children are given priority. During their stay, all
minors receive appropriate care and support. Unaccompanied minors who are long
time residing in Belgium should continue in majority here. If minors
can not stay here, they are as well prepared as possible and with the necessary school certifications
a sustainable living project in the country of origin or another country.
1122.
Unaccompanied minors currently have the right to
to continue their eighteenth birthday in Belgium. In principle we are in favor to
those people after their eighteenth as many permanent residence in us
land grant. To avoid that young people who for some time in Belgium
stay and integration are still being deported, we want the
UM can combine his or her special residency status of an application
for another procedure.
1123.
Pending a decision needs for these minors custom
care, regardless of their status or origin. For the collection and flow
The federal institutions, the communities and CPAS better
cooperate. There will be a formal cooperation protocol that we are in practice
convert.
1124.
All - also from the European Economic Area - unaccompanied minors
get a specialized and independent legal guardian to their 18th. For this,
we organize plenty of calls and training. There comes a
Excellence where governors can go for information and guidance.
Guardians are given the opportunity to specialize in a particular theme. The
procedure is enhanced to change the guardian.
249 1125.
When quickly became clear that the durable solution for the UM stay in
Belgium is a CIRE is immediately (Certificate of Registration in the
Foreigners Register) issued by an indeterminate period.
1126.
The Immigration Office motivates each individual file its decision
to deliver or renew an A card no CIRE. Should from this decision
clearly show the interests which preceded the decision.
1127.
When the Immigration Department an order to deliver reduction,
but the youngster prefers to stay up to 18 years in Belgium, Immigration Department requires him or
her in the waiting list.
1128.
Minors who arrive with or without family in Belgium must quickly answer
get over their future. They have first priority in the procedure. Procrastination can lead
psychological and emotional damage that is not in the best interests of the child.
1129.
Unaccompanied foreign minors and unaccompanied minors often remain after their 18th in Belgium, or not
unlawful. If at the time a request for regularization in own name
filing, they are always considered themselves in extraordinary circumstances
are, which means that it is "impossible or extremely difficult" for the
younger to submit an application for residence in from the country of origin.
1130.
Any decision about the residence is left from the needs and
best interests of the child. For this, we consider specific child
information. In addition, the decision to refuse or to withdraw it may
right of residence not only depend on the criterion of "fraud destroys everything."
The fraud committed by the parents can not automatically lead to a negative
stay decision for the children when they are in majority in his own name
apply.
1131.
Education is very important for a sustainable future for minors.
Therefore unaccompanied minors to get a negative decision, the opportunity to
to complete their school year. Unaccompanied minors also get after the
18 years old the opportunity to finish their education. Certifications
be given so they needed in the country of origin
education able to produce evidence.
1132.
Upon the return of the minor is in cooperation with reliable
partners a strong social research done in the country of origin. That is to
say that compliance with the guarantees of shelter, care and safety
of the minor. If the guarantee for sustainable return not
are met, the decision needs to be revised return.
Marriage migration and family reunification
Marriage migration and family reunification arise from fundamental freedoms of people to
marry their partner of choice and to live together with their families. We defend this
freedoms but without losing sight of the interests of society in mind. We note that
immigration marriages do not always run smoothly. During the early years is
250 partner migrant, for example, strongly depend on the other partner, which is up to a lot of difficulties and
in some cases even leads to exploitation. We want the talents that bring newcomers
cashing that we all work together to build our prosperity. Sometimes there is also talk of abuse:
people who obtain a residence permit through a marriage in Belgium. The communities
Belgium are becoming increasingly aware of these issues, with a declining popularity
marriage migration as a result. This awareness should be further supported. Our
measures are emancipating, not limiting. They ensure the capabilities of both
partners, and their children, to build a future with perspective here.
1133.
We defend the right to marriage migration and family reunification. People
must choose a conscious and free way to whether or not anyone from the
abroad to marry or live together unmarried. But we must also
preventing abuse. Therefore, we must provide good information to whom
faces seeming cohabitation, marriages and forced
marriages. To better combat the phenomenon we want accurate and
accessible statistics. In cooperation with civil society, we aim to
further raising awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of marriage migration.
Victims of domestic violence in the context of marriage migration to us
country came in principle retain their residence as family members of a foreigner.
Economic migration
Poverty can lead people to leave their country. Migration is also an expression of ambition
to live as good a life as possible. That right can people not deny. The labor market
is becoming increasingly international. Talents and creativity of newcomers deploy properly, creates
innovation and prosperity. Economic migration is not the solution, but can people find a job
help, labor shortages can overcome and thus contribute to economic growth and
employment. The point is to deal with solid labor market research on a regular basis
opportunities to assess and implement sustainable labor migration policy. Since within
Europe of free movement of persons and services, allowing EU citizens to work in Belgium or
offer services, it makes sense to first maximize the intra-European labor migration
use. Labour migration from outside the EU could form a capstone.
1134.
Measures on (labor) migration go hand in hand with a strong bet on
activation, training and mobility of the existing potential labor force,
with anti-discrimination measures that are enforceable.
1135.
To efficiently meet the labor market needs remain research,
consider whether the vacancy from the domestic labor market can fill the
Based on labor migration policy. We offer flexible lists
shortage occupations and economic forecasts to meet
structural labor shortages. This dynamic and carefully controlled
list contains both high and low-skilled jobs.
1136.
The European economic migration policy, we need to harmonize. We make
European Blue Card, European work permit for
highly educated, a single harmonized system. Thus, these
251 people work and live freely in the Union and Member States. Circular migration, as
seasonal labor migration, with people most of the year working in a country
and then move to another country, a strong legal framework requires
to regularize the mobility and control. But also to the rights and
to safeguard the protection of the migrants themselves.
1137.
Flanders must develop ways for regular monitoring, follow-up
and better supervision of individual migrants with regard to work and
integration. This is the only guarantee that policies on reality
can be calibrated
1138.
Given the authority over the employment of foreign workers
the regions and will stay remains a federal matter, are closing
agreements between the various levels of competence and cooperation between
the various inspection essential.
1139.
(Work) migration should be urgently incorporated into a sustainable social hatch.
This allows us to social exploitation, unfair competition and fraudulent
Addressing practices in the context of labor migration better. Migrants
can work on the same terms and the same social
protection as any other employee. For this
to effectively enforce labor conditions, we are relying more on
inspection and sanctions. Rights and obligations must be clearer.
Cooperation with organizations who have daily contact with
migrant workers is needed.
1140.
An active migration policy should seek to organize labor-based
partnership agreements. So we can convert brain drain into brain exchange. We address the brain drain sectoral and implement departure restrictions
or recruitment codes for sectors that are very important for the countries of
origin. We create charters with attention to transparency of procedures
and recruitment practices, language, reception and housing opportunities. In
collaboration with the migrant's country of origin and we find ways to
knowledge and resources of the migrant in the host country in an efficient manner
to use in their country of origin. In parallel, we must also work together
to exclude human beings and we can take back clauses
clandestine migrants include in the partnership agreements. The
worker protection should be guaranteed maximum.
1141.
Belgium ratifies UN convention and fits the "Rights of Migrant Workers and their
families' and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) convention on
house personnel.
1142.
On trafficking, we use a multidisciplinary approach. The federal
Specialised police units and local police work closely together. We
strengthen international cooperation. There is a legal basis
of prevention, training, shelters and protection
victims. During the training front-line services are aware
252 made of the problem of human trafficking and smuggling. We also teach them
paying attention to the (possible) refugee victims
trafficking. There is good coordination with the organizations daily
human beings come into contact. We will provide more resources for investigation
by criminal organizations engaged in exploitation.
7:10 Belgium and Flanders in the world
The world is shrinking and countries are increasingly interconnected. What happens on the
world stage is not far-from-my-bed-show. The economic crisis is global,
climate change and cross-border armed conflicts bring refugees
going. The foreign policy of the federal and state governments should not only focus on
the defense of our interests in the world. According sp.a it is also our
social democratic values ​​of liberty, defend equality and social justice in the
rest of the world.
More children go to school, more people have access to potable water and
health facilities. Hopeful. But still 1.4 billion people living in extreme
poverty, while the powers of the hundred richest people in the world together poverty to four
time can end. Human rights are in many places not self-evident: in
Russia remains the repression against political activists and gays large, in many parts of Africa,
dangerous to be gay and the US still carries out the death penalty. Even a safe
habitat remains today for many people a utopia.
sp.a not only want a dignified life for all, here and elsewhere, but also wants to ensure that
future generations to enjoy. The economic and social development where we stand,
consists in our environment and earth to save as much as possible. We want, in other words
sustainable development. By a coherent and ambitious foreign policy of diplomacy,
trade, development and defense complement and reinforce each other, we can
opportunities of globalization are good and honest job lead. Only if everyone there
fruit picking.
International cooperation is the key to the disparity between North and South, but also
within countries to tackle. As a small player Belgium seeks its way in a changing
world stage. Important new players from Asia (China and India), Latin America (Brazil) and Africa
(South Africa and Nigeria) have considerable economic power and play politics with it. The
global economic and geopolitical power relations are subject to constant
change.
The European Union gives us the ability to Belgian interests abroad and
fundamental values ​​to defend more efficiently. Our foreign policy should be the role
strengthen Europe in a multipolar world. A proactive and pronounced Common
Foreign and Security Policy of the EU must make a constructive world player with one
speaking voice.
253 An interdependent world with more equality and less poverty, more secure and more free world
possible. We believe, there goes sp.a for. Our starting point remains: if your crib now in Bamako,
Brussels or Bogota state, everyone is entitled to a dignified existence and even more: a good
life.
Human rights and social protection are the core of our foreign policy
sp.a put human rights and social protection at the heart of its international agenda. These standards
should our foreign policy and development policy, but also our trade and security
active and effective design. At the same time they are pushed forward as the main
targets in various policy areas and levels.
Human rights are universal, indivisible and inalienable. They apply everywhere, for
everybody. Respect for human rights is not only a value in itself. The realization of
Human undeniably contributes to the development. The promotion of these rights
unstable countries also increases the security and the future prospects of people worldwide.
1143.
Every government must respect human rights and international
community has the duty to help countries to meet
human rights obligations. Our foreign policy and
development, and by extension all policy areas and levels in
our country should contribute to the promotion of the full set of rights,
with particular attention to the rights of the child. Both civil,
political, economic, social and cultural rights, but also the lesser known
third and fourth generation of rights: the right to sustainable development, the right
at peace, the right to a healthy environment, the right to decent work.
1144.
Our country takes the lead in the fight for the universal abolition of the
death penalty, the protection of the rights of women, children, gays and
human rights defenders, the fight against all forms of discrimination, the fight
against impunity and the struggle for decent work. The EU and all Member States
should make efficient use of all the instruments - positive action
on diplomacy to targeted sanctions (which should be responsible
hit but not the population) - to act decisively against
human rights violations. We set an ambitious National Action Plan
Human rights that affects regional and federal levels, over the
between policy areas, and contributing to a joint EU Strategy.
1145.
Not only governments should commit to global problems
climate change, poverty and migration. Companies also have a
great social responsibility. These companies must
their export and investment strategies take into account the economic,
social, environmental and cultural impact of their activities here on a
transparent way of reporting and corrective action where necessary. sp.a supports
companies herein and provides guidance through the government instruments.
254 We advocate an ambitious National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights
the Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights of the UN on a
implements actionable way.
1146.
sp.a will bet even more on advocating human rights in the world
and monitoring of these rights in multinational institutions such as the UN or the
Council of Europe .. We want the government to actively participate in the Universal
Periodic Review processes of the UN Member States in the Human Rights Council. We
there are also the necessary resources for free. Periodic Concluding also
Observations concerning individual UN member states by the UN Committee on the Rights
of the Child, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and
form the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination
basic documents for the Belgian diplomacy.
We get to do more and more with it: when our country - rightly - foreign leaders
criticizes the restriction of fundamental freedoms, violence in gay or discharge
international obligations, we invariably get - and sometimes rightly so - to hear that even in
country still work to be done.
1147.
Our country soon ratify international treaties such as the Optional Protocol
to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading
Treatment or Punishment (OPCAT). Belgium is working on the creation of
an independent human rights institution, such as an umbrella for existing
structures, with a view to acquiring the A-state to the plane of
independence in accordance with the Paris Principles.
1148.
Our governments will ensure that you comply by the end of 2015 to all
recommendations in the context of UPR, a periodic evaluation of the
human rights in all member states of the UN Human Rights Council. This includes
more on that in the short term, our governments provide a dignified
solution to the problem of overcrowding in Belgian prisons,
For more employment opportunities for migrants, highlighting the restrictions and
curb domestic violence, violence in gay and racist violence.
Also the various recommendations of the UN Anti-torture committee (relating to
complaints by prisoners, the situation of the internees), the
recommendations and resolutions of the Council of Europe and the rulings of the
European Court of Human Rights (on eg. The Roma,
disability) are better monitored.
Democracy is the best guarantee of freedom and solidarity between individuals. Free
development in human dignity for all requires the protection of fundamental rights
and freedoms. This can be done by a democratic system, is based upon participation and
rule of law. The presence of different political parties and social organizations
gives people the opportunity to stand up for their rights and to hold governments accountable to
cry when they are violated.
255 1149.
The international action of the Belgian government needs democracy
promotion. A vibrant civil society is essential.
Democratic political parties, free trade unions, civil society activists and
Independent media are our allies in the defense and expansion of
democratic societies worldwide. sp.a want our governments operate them
support and protect.
1150.
Our foreign policy remains committed to promoting the rule of law
so that each country would meet its duty to have a strong and
independent judiciary. To ensure a dignified existence
for all people, we also continue to insist on compliance with the
international right. sp.a demands that governments and individuals worldwide
accountable for their actions and that she's Articles of Association
International endorse Criminal Court.
Too often have weaker access to basic services in a society. Everybody has
however, the right to a life of the highest possible quality: a decent income for worthy
employment, access to education, good health care and a quality housing. Social
sp.a protection is not only a right but also a social and economic necessity.
Social protection helps families to protect themselves against poverty and exclusion, but bears
also contribute to economic growth by raising labor productivity and social stability.
Decent work and social protection a central place, is choosing a social and sustainable model
of globalization.
1151.
Development comes from decent work. Belgium is committed to concrete
international achieving decent work and fundamental
labor rights of the International Labour Organisation. Belgium will make every
effort to walk in the delay on the ILO conventions. In
especially Convention 131 on Minimum Wage Fixing will
priority being treated.
1152.
Social protection is an essential component of the decent work agenda.
Right to a decent income, quality education, health care,
housing, food safety, but also the right to freedom of
trade union activity and social dialogue form the basis for sustainable growth, social
justice and social cohesion. Belgium must therefore as social protection
defend development objective, at least in the form of the International
agreed minimum standard. These so-called social protection floor
a step towards universal maximum social protection. Together with the
relevant actors - governments, civil society and economic actors - in the
partner we wish to develop a comprehensive policy of social
protection is central. Attention is paid to the growing
inequality within countries in the South.
1153.
It is the responsibility of every government to mechanisms themselves and
measures to set up transforming social protection for all citizens in the
practice. Belgium provides the necessary resources and technical assistance to the
256 to support partner. To encourage governments, we resume the
Copenhagen 20/20 principle and we call on governments to at least 20 percent
of their budget to invest in basic social services. In exchange points Belgium
15 per cent of the ODA budget to health and minimum
20 percent to support basic social services in the
partner.
1154.
We support the reform of the Economic and Social Council of the UN
(ECOSOC) into a modern multilateral policy-making body that relevant
formulates answers to the challenges of globalization
economic, social and environmental fields.
International Solidarity

The problem of poverty on a global scale has changed and shifted. Pure figures, the
poverty declined in the world. However, the disparity between North and South continues, but also within
large countries. An inclusive and efficient development policy therefore goes beyond
poverty projects and to create a broad social context in which everyone equal opportunities
gets to develop themselves.

1155.

The new post-2015 development agenda - the successor to the
MDGs - must be dedicated to the fight for
equality and the fight against poverty. sp.a emphasizes sustainable
development in all its facets and departs from a legal approach. Worthy
work and social protection are full members of this new agenda.
So that the development would be truly sustainable, developing countries themselves
their focus determine within the internationally agreed framework and ensure that
This focus responds to the specific needs of the population. The
international community has a responsibility to support them.
Quantitative and qualitative indicators must allow the progress
concrete follow.

These global challenges of today and tomorrow require answers other than just those of
the traditional instruments of development cooperation. The responsibility for the
development goals to reach, lies not only in development cooperation. Policy decisions
in areas such as trade and defense, as well as energy and finance, have a
great influence on the world and on the development in the South.

1156.

All governments of our country must work for sustainable development
by committing to an investment, trade, environment, energy and
climate that is good for people and the environment. Here and elsewhere. Creates
employment and coincides with the transfer of knowledge and skills so
the capacities of developing countries to be developed. Every
minister has his own international responsibilities and is responsible for
installing a reflex development within its policy area. The minister
257

of Development ensures the coherence between the different
levels and departments. It will also be more attention paid to the
European framework. As Belgium contributes to the development of a coherent and
strong European development agenda.
To reach our goal, we tackle global issues with more consistency.
Meanwhile, we expect the development in more traditional sense not just
amortize. Good development indeed has a direct impact on the
life (quality) of millions of people.

1157.

Development cooperation is even more of a catalyst for development.
The programs of development cooperation of the Belgian authorities
should start from the needs of the local population and compatible with the
local policies and focused on long-term objectives. We develop together
with the other EU donors a long-term vision and focus on good governance
strengthening the capacities of partner countries themselves. Good governance which bet
equitable and transparent tax systems, combating fraud and
better use of natural resources in the partner generates
revenues are used for the development of partner countries. As to
these conditions are met, budget support can be considered.

1158.

The list of partner countries for governmental development cooperation
shall be reviewed every 10 years and updated as developments on the ground
there give a reason. This list will be submitted for approval to
the parliament. Belgium focuses on the areas where we have experience and where
we mean real added value: health, education,
agriculture and basic infrastructure. We do so in consultation with other
country donors in the field, primarily the EU and its Member States. To
to address transboundary issues, we work in regional
dressings. Where possible, we encourage South-South cooperation, with the
Belgian authorities as working with stronger countries in the region.
Which often have their own expertise to the development of the weaker neighbors
to support.

1159.

Belgium supports local economic activities from SMEs and
cooperatives to stimulate economic development. In association with
these local entrepreneurs, civil society and local authorities
we help to create a business-friendly environment for decent work:
clear legislation, quality infrastructure and access to finance.

1160.

sp.a do not want the government to cut further development.
In times of economic crisis it is important that we also solidarity
international level to maintain. The ratio between the size of the
resources for development and the effects which it aims,
We align together. sp.a wants an ambitious and realistic growth that
striving our commitment to spending 0.7 percent of Gross National Income
To realize next legislature. One-time expenses such as debt cancellation
258

make no structural contribution and we should not have to enter in the budget
of development. We are not only ambitious with the classic
public resources for development but also look for new and
additional funding modes. Income from a global financial
transaction tax be used for global sustainable development.
Except ambitious targets aimed at also from internal emission reduction must in Belgium
international level committed to sustainable energy and a just transition to
a low-carbon society. The development of the Belgian authorities must
therefore pay particular attention to the consequences of climate change in the South. The
causes and effects of climate change are unevenly distributed around the world and take
particularly the least resilient countries.

1161.

Belgium must continue to play a leading role in the negotiations for a
new international climate agreement in Paris in 2015. In emerging countries such as
Brazil, India, China and South Africa, who are responsible for larger and larger parts of the
Total greenhouse gas emissions, to be asked for increased efforts
supply to reduce it.

1162.

Belgium is an ambitious and predictable engagement with concrete benchmarks
relating to climate finance. International climate finance is needed
for developing countries to take climate action and the consequences of
Global warming, for example, extreme weather conditions, to
catch. To tax the budget is not too bright, we use the proceeds of
the auctioning of allowances for our climate and energy policy. Is then
partly secured for international climate finance.

A fair international economic and tax system
Trade is a powerful lever for economic and social development, but must therefore
we make and create regulatory frameworks good international agreements that the benefits of
trade divides in a fair manner. Too often trade goes hand in hand with unacceptable excesses
such as social exploitation, depletion of natural resources and environmental dumping. Also by European
businesses. The EU can no longer stand by and must decisively. A fair
trade policy creates sustainable and decent jobs, generate revenue for the financing of
our social welfare, new opportunities for businesses and also indicates consumer benefits.
Fair trade also contributes to sustainable development in the South and stop the momentum
of growing inequality.

1163.

We strive for fair trade. Where we trade with our trading partners more
decisiveness incitement to respect international rules. But also
Trade with the right of governments is respected for national rules
establish pursuing legitimate purposes, such as social protection,
consumer, environmental and animal protection. These rules can not just
be dismissed as protectionist trade barriers.
259

1164.

We use European trade policies to our social democratic values
to achieve such as social equality, democracy and respect for
human rights. We also promote international environmental standards. This
standards we apply to all aspects of trade agreements by making them
take in a chapter on sustainable development. Ratification of
international conventions is insufficient. These conventions are to be
applied. To ensure compliance with international human rights, labor and
to enforce environmental conventions, we take control and
evaluation mechanisms in the agreements. Not respecting these standards
can be sanctioned and can lead to the suspension of the agreements.
Positive developments can be rewarded.

1165.

In vrijhandelsonderhanderlingen, such as with the US, we watch it on
that our high standards for the protection of data in the public -both
as protected in the privésector-.

1166.

We give vulnerable developing countries a helping hand with some
trade benefits that help to combat poverty and a fairer distribution
enabling prosperity. Developing countries a greater commitment
show on social and labor standards, democracy,
human rights and environmental receive additional support. We help them this
trade advantages to exploit and support the development of their own
capacities. They get the opportunity to their economically important sectors
to be protected, so that they are able to their own economic capacity
strengthen.

1167.

We go for safe trade. Trade policy should provide a guarantee
more transparency in the production chain. We look closely at that
products sold in Europe are safe and human health,
animals and plants do not harm.

1168.

We go artificial and fraudulent trade flows against which harmful to
our economy and trading partners for whom they are intended. Abuse
punishable by pulling trade advantages.

1169.

Trade policy needs to be a more inclusive and transparent manner
formulated and meet our wider democratic demands around
legitimacy. Apart from the European Parliament should the wider society, not
only the major European export companies are better involved. Not only at
defining objectives, but also in negotiations and
implementation of trade agreements and European trade legislation in the
general.

Companies need our help abroad. sp.a bet on an export and investment
to help SMEs to achieve their potential and their competitiveness internationally to
guarantees. We use the export and investment to a socially responsible
business to promote and inform companies of their responsibilities.

260

1170.

We cater to the export and investment in the development of sustainable
economic activities and jobs. The potential for job creation is an important
criterion for granting aid to companies. We focus first
instance on SMEs. We give special attention to exports and investments
innovative and environmentally sound products and services. We promote
contracts and partnerships that technology transfer to the South
accomplish. We strive for a socially inspired economic
diplomacy which pays more attention to these smaller, innovative players

A just global financial structure is an important prerequisite for sustainable,
global growth and development. The recent crisis made painfully aware of the weaknesses and
gaps in the international economic and financial architecture. Financial markets have
in recent decades more and more disconnected from the real economy. As it operates now is
the international financial system beneficial for the big players. At the expense of citizens
can not bet on financial markets, but also at the expense of less developed countries. For
sp.a financial markets must again serve the real economy,
employees and productive businesses.

1171.

A fair international financial system supports global sustainable,
inclusive growth and development. A just financial system creates jobs
and in developing countries it joins battle against inequality, poverty and
hunger. Reforms should focus on stability. We do it by
risk reduction and the reduction of volatile short-term official and private
capital flows.

1172.

Strong national and international financial institutions are essential pillars of
a well-functioning international financial system. The IMF and the
World Bank should more democratic and more transparent. Moreover, we must
developing countries in the international decision-making.

1173.

The use and abuse of their transnational structure, and the lack of
national and international control, carry large multinational and financial
groups do not contribute to the tax base for a fair policy. Belgium must
actively participate in mandatory identification of owners of companies. We
also require country-by-country and project-by-project reporting by
multinationals and financial groups to prevent them from escaping
fair taxes.

1174.

Belgium must take the lead in working in international organizations
rules that capital flight and tax evasion through tax havens
stop. We strive for actions aimed at capacity building
equitable tax systems set up in developing countries. We think
while the Tax Inspectors without Borders initiative of the OECD.

1175.

It is unacceptable for sp.a that banking institutions offer products
linked to the rise in food prices. This has dire consequences
the food security of the countries in the South and dramatic effects
261

for local producers. We argue for the introduction of efficient
position limits (maximum number of investments) to speculation
To prevent food products. This not only at national but also at
European level.

Together provide a secure world
For a comprehensive and intelligent approach of (potential) conflict and crisis we must
use all the tools and levers we have. The first important step towards sustainable
peace and security is to address issues that lie at the basis of conflicts. The
international community has a responsibility to assist failing states in the
protection of their populations. Put through our diplomacy, development and defense
we in the promotion of development and social justice, democratic institutions and
human rights. If states fail or refuse to protect their populations, we must
take responsibility. Military intervention is thereby a final instrument.
A military approach to conflict can never stand alone, but is sometimes necessary
an integrated approach. Therefore we need an efficient and modern defense which at
serve the citizens and we are committed to the implementation of a Belgian, European and
international security and defense policy. We also remain committed to civilian operations,
reconstruction and peace after conflict.

1176.

The Belgian defense (as an organization) was the recent years dramatically
reformed. However, there is a need for a strategic plan with a long term vision.
We put our qualitative and quantitative level of ambition fixed. The plan enrols
in the European and international context, and is established after a broad
dialogue with all stakeholders and the parliament.

1177.

The European Security Strategy of 2003 still provides a valuable framework,
but we need to supplement with strategic priorities. We want to clear
define what responsibilities will include the EU as a 'security
provider. For sp.a emphasis on neighboring countries and regions,
elaborate maritime strategy and an ambitious European contribution to the UN system of collective security. We go for a European
level of ambition in line with the European Security and
defense policy. At a quantitative level, we want a rapidly deployable reserve
makes the difference on the ground on top of the ongoing operations.

1178.

F35 as a replacement for our F16 fighter is not good for sp.a
choice. In the preparation of the strategic plan in the long term we must all
Options View merits and dare to choose which major operational capabilities
may be retained. sp.a targets a specialized army that
provides genuine added value in a European and international context.

1179.

Nuclear weapons are useless, expensive and dangerous weapons of mass destruction. sp.a wants
therefore, that it be removed as quickly as possible from the Belgian
262

territory and our country are made free of nuclear weapons. The withdrawal of the
nuclear weapons at Kleine Brogel is the necessary first step in the Belgian
strive for a nuclear-free Europe. We develop a strategy for the
Belgian contribution at international fora. Our country will deploy in a
progressive timetable for a nuclear-free world, the succession of
UN Conference on Disarmament and the Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Moreover, we strive for nuclear-free zones in the
particularly in the Near and Middle East, and we strive for the improvement of
the security of nuclear materials and strengthen the role of the
International Atomic Energy Agency.

1180.

By working together with other countries, avoid duplication and
gaps. We spend our defense budget in a smart way. The Benelux level is a good collaboration platform, but wants the sp.a
defense cooperation is not limited to one regional cluster. If we want
evolve into a European continent that works, we need
various regional and thematic cooperation. Coordination at European level
of the various collaborative projects within the EU is needed to
to ensure consistency.

1181.

Despite good intentions and existing projects with a genuine added value,
European defense is still too much a sum of 28 Member States. States should
specialize in certain tasks as much as possible so that there is no time limit on
excess capacity from one task or under-capacity of the other is. Therefore, there is
need for a clear top-down control from the European Council of Ministers
defense, the European External Action Service and the European
Defence Agency. sp.a goes one step further. We also want to
defense planning in advance coordination at European level within the European
EDA, before placing them on the national level for analysis and
decision.

1182.

The military and civilian personnel is the capital of the Belgian defense. Good
educated and trained people are the backbone and the foundation for success. Their
safety, education, training and well-being are a priority in our decisions. The
recruitment remains a priority, as is ensuring the attractiveness
a career in the army. We need to put our people in meaningful
jobs with adequate equipment. Defense must also have the ability
offer to acquire skills and experience that are useful and relevant to
other career choices in the future. sp.a performs a real gender policy. We
introduce temporary quotas to allow more women to move into the context of the
general officers.

1183.

Our priority is participation in foreign operations, by which orders
we we have proven our abilities. Our Belgian defense must together
with European and international partners continue to do its part. In short, if the
Government decides that is appropriate participation in a peacekeeping operation, then
defense needs quickly and flexibly make a meaningful contribution. A
263

UN mandate for sp.a a condition to participate in overseas
operations. sp.a attaches importance to missions under UN and European flag.
1184.

A large part of the operations in the framework of the European
common security and defense policy are of civil nature. The UN also
and the OSCE to send several civilian operations. Hereby give experts
assistance to the reform and strengthening police and judicial
institutions, whether they monitor the implementation of agreements. Such operations are
building blocks for lasting peace and security, but recruiting
experts are not always obvious. We want a review of the national strategy,
with a thorough assessment of priorities and strategic objectives
financing mechanisms. An evaluation of the Belgian commitment and exchange
good practices at EU level are necessary.

1185.

Foreign operations are an important task for defense, but gives sp.a
the same importance to a close defense and at the service of the citizen. Ayuda
The nation includes several assignments where the army proved its worth
has and we appreciate that. Challenges include the
interventions of the bomb squad DOVO, helicopters are ready for
search and rescue missions or the Navy makes an important contribution to the
fight against marine pollution. Finally sp.a confident defense
can provide a useful support to the winter shelter for the homeless.

1186.

The parliament enacts participation and extension of foreign
operations. The parliamentary monitoring commission operations abroad must
can fully play its role. The committee provides regular and
adequate reporting and discussion of current foreign operations.
sp.a advocates a more continuous and structured cooperation between
national parliaments and the European Parliament.

Uncontrolled arms stirs armed conflict. Each year the world continues
trade in conventional weapons require an enormous human toll. Belgian flak comes through
Saudi Arabia within Syria. While the federal government asked for more attention
human rights situation in Libya, the regime army brandished weapons from FN Herstal.

1187.

For sp.a can arms with countries in conflict regions or countries with regimes
which violate human rights are not absolute. The audit of the brokering and
so the real end users of "our" weapons should be stricter. sp.a wants
transit of military equipment and weapons control, even if it is not
transhipped in our country. On the basis of the current Wapenhandel Decree, which is not
possible.

International cooperation: foreign policy
Foreign policy should the Belgian interests abroad, multilateral institutions and
defend defense of fundamental values. This happens in bilateral and multilateral
context, increasingly, within the framework of the EU.
264

1188.

The EU is already an active global player, but still has too little impact.
The European External Action Service, the broker must be a proactive
and pronounced Common Foreign and Security Policy. We want
the decision-making process relating to the Common
Foreign and Security Policy shift from unanimity to a
qualified majority. If the EU fails to speak with one voice,
they can not be a constructive world player who rightly international leadership
can absorb. We want the decision-making process regarding the
Common Foreign and Security shifting
unanimity to qualified majority. Together with other
powers the EU must assume its responsibility for peace and
security, sustainable development and solidarity, whatever the defense
human rights and the strict observance of international law means.

1189.

A reform of the UN Security Council is imperative. If the EU succeeds in
to speak with one voice, they should have a common seat in the
Security instead of individual seats for its member states. In addition,
we straighten the relations with developing countries or regions a voice
to give. A democratic voting process should the systematic use of
make it impossible to veto within the Security Council. Only a representative
UN can be a credible mediator. In addition, we have the
strengthen cooperation with regional organizations like the African Union.

The European Union exerts because of its prosperity, stability and freedom a key
attraction on the neighboring countries which are not members. But the many accessions from the
past, the Union controllability in jeopardy. A debate on the borders of the EU
we can no longer shy away from. No further extensions, but deepening of the EU
is today essential. The Union must, as explained previously put, having a strong social pillar
minimum standards and safeguards against exploitation and its institutions must continue to
to adapt to the changed reality.

1190.

No further enlargements of the Union. The agreements with current candidate countries we'll come after. From previous enlargements, we learned that
Excluding the impact of new Member States on the functioning of the EU must thoroughly
analyze and prepare before they can join. We continue with the current
Candidates critical for meeting the Copenhagen criteria (a
constitutional democracy, a functioning market economy and the European
legislation to take over). We also pay special attention to the
compliance with European rules on the social level. Once a member country, since it is
much harder to encourage the reforms. Candidate countries
must meet all conditions before they can join.

Our policy also focuses on trade and investment promotion in the countries where we
trade relations with it. Free trade agreements have access to foreign markets
265

increase, but should not undermine our own values ​​and standards. The affairs Snowden and
SWIFT made painfully clear that the Belgian and EU relations with the US in this field need
a correction. That US secret service NSA widely EU citizens and EU leaders
overhears the US illegally or had access to the banking data is unacceptable and contrary
with the values ​​shared by Belgium and the US. Also with the emerging countries in Africa, Asia and South America
We develop economic relations that serve the interests of both parties.

1191.

The European Union should pursue FTAs ​​with emerging
economies, without betraying its own principles and values: ie struggle
against social and environmental dumping and respect for human rights and democracy.
At the same time we must not compromise the development opportunities and needs
trade liberalization are tailored to the needs and abilities of the
developing countries. We promote the internationalization of the Belgian
business by strengthening the bilateral ties.

1192.

sp.a does not allow a trade agreement with the US multinational
gives companies the opportunity to legitimate policies and laws,
For example, to set environmental legislation in question. We therefore oppose
the inclusion of a mechanism for settling disputes between investors
and states. We see to it that regulatory convergence is without prejudice
the stringent EU standards on consumer protection and food safety.
The preservation of the precautionary principle in the drafting of legislation in this area
ensures that EU products such as genetically modified crops or
hormones meat access to its market can continue to deny, if this
wishes. We also ensure that audiovisual services outside the
held chord.

1193.

Belgium looks strictly ensure that the current legal framework for international
cooperation and information exchange between national intelligence
be maintained. New binding international agreements
made, the control mechanisms are strengthened and a Code of Conduct
developed. In addition to the agreements with the US drafted a European framework.
Both contain strong guarantees for the respect of the right to privacy and
data protection.

The people on the Egyptian Tahrir Square or in the streets of Tunisia calling for social
justice, economic development and freedom. True revolutionary forces
youth movements, trade unions and human rights organizations. It is for them and with them that we
work towards prosperity, welfare and true democracy in the Middle East. They should not
to choose between the old regime and conservative Islamists. sp.a is convinced that a
third - radical-progressive - way is possible.

1194.

An ambitious EU Neighbourhood Policy should underlying causes of
Addressing instability by promoting good governance and support. This
policies should be developed in consultation with the countries of the region and connect
the needs of reform movements. We thereby support social
266

organizations working for human rights, democracy and social
justice. Also by opening up its markets and to work on
real economic integration, the EU can make its contribution. Trade relations
contribute to economic development and the containment of unemployment, especially
among young people.
1195.

The extreme and brutal violence in Syria, which is accompanied by huge
refugee flows and a deadlock in the UN Security Council, the calls
international community for urgent action. Belgium must be proactive role
regarding continuing respect for international humanitarian law.
It is imperative that the EU positions itself as a (more) credible partner
to achieve peace and stability in Syria. Belgium, the European
actively support efforts for a political solution.

1196.

The EU must adopt a more independent policy towards the peace process
in the Middle East. Where possible back to the US
effort, where appropriate on his own footing and with international law
the ultimate touchstone. We call on both sides to take measures that
strengthen mutual trust and condemn in the strongest terms all
measure which can harm the peace process. sp.a pleads for correct labeling
of products from the illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian
Areas. We exclude them from the benefits of bilateral agreements with
Israel and implement mitigation measures for financial transactions between
organizations or companies and the settlements. We demand the immediate
lifting of the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip.

Central Africa remains an important region for the Belgian foreign policy and is a region where
Belgium has an impact. Through our expertise, we can make a substantial contribution. Thereby
we not only focus on alleviating the humanitarian needs, but we are committed to
Structural contributions. The focus on southern Africa is maintained. Especially with South Africa
Belgian governments have a strong bond. We continue to invest in relations with these
strategic partner, which is an influential player in the region.

1197.

The federal government needs a coherent and ambitious note for Belgian
engagement in the Great Lakes region to capture. This strategy should
Defining long-term outlines for Belgian policy in its entirety. Herewith
human rights and access to basic social services should be central
and must be focused on democratization, good governance (including
natural resources) and the causes of conflict in Burundi, DR Congo and
Rwanda. A better understanding of the region and improved cooperation with
strong African Union and various regional organizations (the South African
Development Community, the International Conference on the Great Lakes, the East African Community) is essential if we are African ownership and
engagement is structural. This note serves as a guide for the Belgian
diplomacy, development, defense and other relevant
Departments at all levels.
267

1198.

The fight against illegal exploitation of minerals is important for the
prevention of conflicts. Belgium is continuing its efforts for a transparent and
proper use of revenues from natural resources for the people
of the region. We support the strengthening of the administration, organization, supervision
and management of natural resources in total transparency and fight the battle
against corruption and fraud.

8 COOPERATING AUTHORITIES
8.1 The purpose of the government is a good life for everyone
sp.a strives for a good life for everyone, and believes the government as a major
must contribute to. We believe that things do not have to stay as they are, but that the
society it can move forward, if we are together. One of the most important
forms of cooperation for progress is the government.
So the government can curb violence and crime fighting, lack of freedom and oppression take away
and redress inequality. She can teach people, encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship and
offering a cultural offer to everyone. They can provide and absorb those who are sick or old and
new work lead who is without work. The government can safety, security, freedom and
create opportunities for all people. Also for the weak and oppressed. They can be a means
by passively as a tool to create the future rather than to undergo it.
To fulfill that mission, the government should have good and motivated staff
are optimally organized. Only then can it really make a difference in people's lives.
Its structure must conform to the social democratic wish of all people
as much as possible to provide freedom, justice and welfare. It must in such a way
constructed that they are your family, businesses and associations to offer their services
really make life better.
And exactly why structures are also essential for us. Because we want all our content
for can only realize the society with a government that is optimally structured and
working properly. A government that actually reach people and change their lives for the better.

1199.

The ultimate goal of sp.a is to all people as possible liberty and well-being
provide. The government therefore has to play an important role. It is a form
cooperation between all residents who can contribute to an eminently good
life for all. The government therefore has to play an essential. spa
aims for a government that has sufficient resources to its task
pursuing public services optimally.

1200.

The task of government is to contribute to the greatest possible freedom and well-being
for all people. Its structure or organization should be entirely devoted to
that assignment.

An effective and high government
Because the structure and organization of government it determines whether the quality of everyone's life
can improve is good it works for us essential. The government should not keep stabbing
good intentions, they need to convert these intentions into services that people actually
reach and improve their lives.
269

For example it is not enough that the government trains run later from A to B. These trains
must also provide adequate space and comfort to the traveler and on time. Also for
Other sectors we strive for the highest quality standards.

1201.

The government can its goal of freedom and well-being among the general population
increase only achieve if they work effectively. Only if the government
excellent staff and effective structures has, they can offer services that
Making people's lives better actually. An ineffective operation and
structure mean that the services offered are flawed and
social democratic goals remain unmet.

An efficient government
sp.a not just want an effective but also economically, which carefully every penny
used. A public offering for example not two identical services twice, and
never paid drivers available than necessary.
The government eventually uses means that everyone contributes to. This creates a moral
duty: that community resources should be just used optimally.
That is even more true in a period of economic crisis and major fiscal tightening, which
state has less revenue and should offer strong support. At all levels of government,
federal, Flemish, provincial and municipal there is less money available. If we take the level of the
Services at least want to keep or even want to jack up right, we will have to make
sure we only spend once every cent and well in the most economical manner with the
greatest possible effect.
Further causes waste of resources for major frustration among the people. This undermines the legitimacy of
the government. In these times, where more than ever challenged by social welfare
State support for this form of government should not be in danger threaten to come through inefficiencies. As
Public support fades, also threatens the whole social democratic project of freedom and well-being
everyone lost.

1202.

For sp.a it is essential that the government is not only effective, but
also efficient. That is to say, they must be carefully and economical use of the
fiscal resources and social security contributions which the residents to trust her.
Waste of resources is, especially in this period of economic and budgetary
tightness, immoral and erodes the support of the social welfare state. That we
against waste of public funds does not mean that we are a hyper slim government. The government should be as large as necessary for its
fulfill public duties.

270

Governments working together, work better
Only if the European, Belgian, Flemish, provincial and municipal level and their
distinguished services work together, we can cut a human scale,
ensuring proper and comprehensive services.
Only when the various governments and their departments know each other and work together,
we can avoid duplication, and ensuring services are contradictory.
So no one should suffer at the counter of the complex way in which the government behind it
counter (or back office) is built. Everyone is entitled to the principle of one service - one-stop shop. This
one-stop shop policy is the ultimate result of governments working together for effective and
efficient services.

1203.

The government is more layered and more divided than ever. For his services
duplication or contradiction between different authorities and their services
avoidance, cooperation between them is intense. For sp.a complexity may
the government does not translate into a confusing and time-consuming
services. The complicated state structure can only back office
his affair. The end user must first get to create some service
with one-stop shop - thanks to governments and behind the scenes
cooperate.

1204.

The will to cooperate with officials from different strata and departments
The government wants sp.a teach by admitting officials internship at the
various services and levels of the state. Only then they will be familiar enough
touch with their colleagues with whom they must work together to find a coherent and
efficient
Services
to
guarantees.
Also
a
atmosphere
from
responsibility in government is essential for the promotion
of cooperation between officials of different layers and departments
government.

A government as close to you
The decisions taken by the government and the services it offers, make sense only if they
effectively make a difference in the lives of people, companies and associations. This is best
guaranteed if decisions and their implementation take place at the level closest to the
people state. We need to build the government, in other words with respect for the
subsidiarity.

1205.

Political decisions and their implementation should take place at the level
closest to people, companies and associations, state, unless it is necessary
that a higher level that takes. The principle of subsidiarity implies that the
policy should preferably be made at the local level. And so that the
271

powers for these policies themselves as much as possible at the same local
level must be located.
A democratic government
The government can only maintain its strength and legitimacy if it is built according to
democratic principles. Your family, the government should allow effective control and steering via
elections and by the public debate in the media. To democratic oversight by the people
and to make possible the opposition during a period of government, it is essential that the government and
its decision-making, be transparent and accessible to the media and public.
It is also necessary that the democratic society participates in policy: sp.a want
unions, health insurance funds and employers' organizations are closely involved in the
creation and implementation of social policy and health policy. The expertise,
field knowledge and democratic legitimacy of organized society should according sp.a
be used in making and implementing policies, in the areas where they are at home. Both
federal and Flemish level.

1206.

The government needs a democratic structure. This means that there is a
effective democratic control must exist on the doings of the state
by the voters, the opposition, the media and individuals. For sp.a means
democratic government, participation in the democratic society to
certain aspects of the policy in the creation and implementation of the
social and economic policy, labor market and health
we want trade unions, mutual insurance companies and employers closely
see question. The expertise, local knowledge and legitimacy of organized
society increase the democratic nature and effectiveness of the policy.

Participatory Government
A government can deliver better, more efficient and more legitimate work as they stake
many people as possible in the policy seriously. Involve your family and associations can
ensure that more relevant information comes up and that more societal concerns
and interests are clearly there to follow decisions.
There are today more people than ever before and associations who possess the knowledge,
network, to the media access, access to professional colleges and judges to the government
check. Elections are an important form of democratic participation and control;
monitoring by committed individuals, action groups, associations and media are another.
Both should complement each other.
It is the task of the democratic government of that new possibilities of participation
utilizing. Participating residents provide legitimacy, information, well-balanced
decisions and save time.

272

1207.

sp.a believe in your participation in the policy as an important form of
democratic participation and control in between elections.

1208.

A prerequisite for effective participation of the population, which is
government is "open." sp.a want a government that provides access to its inhabitants
relevant government documents and as transparent and accountable as possible
act. Where disclosure of public order and public safety
population and brings the privacy of citizens in danger, the government may have access to
refuse documents. Documents on confidential negotiations
precede a political or administrative decision, the government must pass after
that decision public.

1209.

sp.a also wants plans for significant and radical measures or
projects will be presented prior to the participative society:
the concerned individuals, associations, businesses, governments and
agencies.

1210.

All relevant groups according sp.a must be given the time and opportunity to their
insights, concerns and interests on the measure or project known
to make to the government. We want the government to every comment or
demand from society to provide a real answer.

1211.

In controversial dossiers politics for a clear societal choice
Place it between two or more options, sp.a favor of the possibility of
a plebiscite. At the local level is that possibility already provided. The sixth
State reform provides new powers for Flanders on this
area: that of a referendum on the entire territory of Flanders. The
plebiscite, however, is no more than an addition to the normal
parliamentary political debate and does not affect our system of indirect
democracy.

1212.

sp.a wants to use the new power to keep
plebiscites at the level of the Länder. It wants a decree
work out which provides for the possibility of such volskraadplegingen in
socially controversial dossiers society and politics for a clear
Placing choice.

1213.

For sp.a participation is not only involve an issue of it as early as possible
of people in decision making, but also of encouraging anyone
policy to create it. Participation is also social activation of people,
so a policy to grow his impulses really get down from.

02.08 Europe, closer to you
Confidence in the European Union as a bringer of prosperity and economic stability by
The crisis dented. Anti-European parties play here eagerly and populism is widely
spread. According to these populists, Europe would be better off without the EU. Many Europeans see the
Union no longer as a positive force that brings progress.
273

The problem with the discussion about ending this crisis of confidence is that they often
bogged down in grand plans about treaty changes and institutional reform: the European
Commission transform it into a genuine European government, the committee directly
get elected by the people of Europe, establish a new institution with representatives of
national parliaments, and so on. All these proposals are valuable and deserve a debate,
but in the short term will not strengthen democracy in Europe. Treaty changes require
After all, usually a lot of time and encounter much resistance. We do not have any great at this time
necessary institutional reforms, but socio-economical. Therefore sp.a will spend the next five years
for strengthening the legitimacy within the existing treaties. We want the European
debate to bring European households by focusing on increased cooperation between the
European Parliament, the Council and the national parliaments.

1214.

sp.a wants a strong institutional link between the national parliament on the one hand and
the European Parliament and the Council on the other, so that the ownership of what
increases so at European level. Cooperation between the national and
European institutions can bring the European debate into the political spotlight of
the national parliament and the media. sp.a will in the Statute for Members of the
Parliament include the following text: "the MEP
represents the interests of the Union as a whole and not just that of the Member State
which he or she has been selected. "

1215.

Parliamentary committees should as soon as possible following sp.a
proposals treat European law. Proposals that the
Committees are of particular importance, they attract to it for political
control. These proposals will be discussed in consultation with external
specialists and the relevant Belgian MEPs.

1216.

sp.a wants the federal Chamber of Deputies and the Flemish
Parliament systematically prepare the various Councils. Therefore,
the competent ministers in the substantive committees, the Belgian or Flemish
position that they represent in Europe, explain. The minister is
questioned about the position that Belgium occupies in the Council.

1217.

sp.a wants the committees to the proposals and any amendments
remain in the Belgian position to follow up the case is closed. The
relevant parliaments may restrain its government in the Council to
consent to the agreement that was found at European level.

1218.

Each year a European Commissioner should the national parliament and of the Länder
attend you during a plenary session at the overall economic and
Social Commission strategy and the annual country-specific recommendations
to explain.

1219.

Belgium is one of the worst students in the class when it comes to transposing
European legislation. This risks we have to pay fines. sp.a will

274

Involving administrations at all levels more closely in the monitoring of legislation
so they are adequately prepared for the conversion and implementation.
1220.

The European Parliament has one seat, in Brussels. The expensive and unnecessary in seat
Strasbourg must disappear.

1221.

sp.a wants the directly elected European Parliament and the appointment
deposition from the committee and the commissarrissen pulling back,
as befits a mature parliamentary democracy. The European Parliament
can do this by his attitude to the treaty within the existing limits
appointment to change the Commission. They allowed the committee and
his commissioners only give the necessary thing parliamentary support, as the
president of one candidate Presidents forward is by a
group in the European Parliament.

8.3 The Belgian Union with four states
In recent years, the federal government at the expense of much political energy, thoroughly reformed. The
electoral district Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde is split, the old Senate was abolished and were
many new powers and additional resources transferred to the states, especially in
relating to labor, the elderly, living and family policy. So many powers and resources
were transferred to the center of gravity of the state gradually siphoned direction states.
In which political operation has sp.a sought to transfer jurisdiction over only
to be better exercised by the states for the sake of the quality of service.
We did not provide the "Flemish nation 'own powers as much as possible, but the Fleming
a deliver the best possible public services. The latter involved immediately
sp.a sought to ensure it has the power to packages that were Belgian and one that
Flemish were to be as coherent as possible. So both levels can have a full and
worthwhile pursuing policies with their own powers.
Examples of powers that require region-specific policy and thus better level
of the regions belong, precisely the labor, housing, elderly and family policy.
Federal states such as Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels may respond better than Belgium in the specific
regional needs of their populations. Often it would be even better if these and other powers,
were exercised on an even smaller scale government to implement the policy more accurate
to focus on local needs.
Regarding the structure of the Belgian state, it would be absurd to quickly turn to a new
State reform to proceed. The states must be given the time to their new responsibilities
in annexing their structures and to something with to pursue its own policy which is closer to
the wishes and needs of our population.
Only after a number of years, there may be an evaluation of the new state, in which we
see what does work and what does not. This assessment will not go sp.a taboo out of the way: if it appears
275

Flemish certain powers can be exercised effectively and efficiently on the
Belgian level, they must return to this level. If certain powers that are now in Belgium
level are exercised, could be better applied to this need in Flanders
Flanders. And if powers that now are better applied to the Flemish level
be exercised at the local level, they also have to go to this local level. However, in anticipation of
such a thorough evaluation, any transfer of powers purely ideological and premature. Is now
it is the task of all levels of government to make the best use of their existing powers;
to collaborate where it is useful for a good service to your family.

1222.

According sp.a powers may be transferred only to the
Lander if this service to the people benefit. The new
powers of the states associated with labor,
elderly care, housing and family policies have been transferred from that devotion
During the sixth state reform.

1223.

In a few years, when the new structure is sufficiently long in the
practice work, we must evaluate whether the new powers
are located at the appropriate level of power. That is, at the level where
the best service can be guaranteed. Pending that evaluation
sp.a wants no new transfer of powers from the federal level to
the Lander. sp.a has continued to focus on the issues
inventory that must be addressed in a subsequent reform to
get a more efficient operation of government.

1224.

That review of the existing state structures will sp.a no taboo Warning:
if it appears that the powers can be better applied to the Belgian
level, they must again thither; if the Flemish government for the exercise
the new powers given corresponding Belgian privileges
has, those to the states. Finally, if local governments more convenient
to exercise the new Flemish powers, they also need to
that level may be transferred.

Since the sixth state reform, Belgium is no longer a full-fledged federal state. This requires the
autonomy of the sub-entities too large. Neither Belgium is a loose confederation of
independent states working together by treaty. The current partnership of
Lander is a hybrid: a union of four states.
Belgian Union which is not a relic destined to evaporate, but a fundamental part
the Belgian state structure. The Union state through social security and health care,
guarantees solidarity among all Belgians. Since the social security and healthcare
efficient and equitable can be organized on a higher state level, hear this
powers staying at the Union level home. In that sense, the Belgian union is essentially a
welfare state.
The Union comprises four states, of which Brussels is one. Brussels after the sixth
state reform even more become an autonomous region than before. Not only does Brussels
276

additional
regional powers
received,
but

Allows the sixth state reform confirms the years grown Brussels autonomy
and identity. It would contradict those years of development to commit to Brussels
appurtenance to choose between the Flemish and Walloon Community. Brussels to force
choose the Walloon or Flemish sub-nationality would mean the territory of the
Brussels Capital Region, two different social security schemes are introduced,
and on the basis of ethnic criteria. That is morally and socially disruptive
unacceptable.

1225.

Belgium is the sixth state reform since no ordinary federal state more. The
Belgium's center of gravity has shifted to the states, whose autonomy
is increasing. Belgium is in fact not a fully-fledged federal state more nor
a loose confederation of states: the EU's four states. That new
reality for sp.a is no intermediate stage towards independence or
confederalism, but a sustainable institutional balance.

1226.

According sp.a it is the inalienable duty of the Belgian Union for the
organize solidarity among all Belgians. On the larger scale of the
Belgian level, social security and health care, after all,
efficient and fairer take shape. In that sense, an essential Belgium
Social Union.

1227.

Brussels is one of the four states of the Belgian Union and has since the sixth
State reform also powers as the family and the
juvenile criminal law. Brussels should never associated with those powers
forced to choose between Flanders and Wallonia. sp.a designate a

8.4 The Flemish Government is working on better service
The sixth state reform has shifted to the major powers and resources
regions, this policy further gain importance. It is therefore crucial that this
policy functions optimally in order to respond to the major social
challenges and meet the needs and aspirations of the population in the
general and local authorities in particular, who are closest to the citizen.
There is in this political turning point, a window of opportunity to adjust a few things. Also
must be handled with efficient regulations. There are too many rules today.

1228.

The comprehensive reform of the Flemish administration in 2006, (Better Administrative
Policy), needs assessment. The far-reaching autonomy of the agencies
277

in itself a good thing but the pendulum is beaten by a number of areas: the
number of agencies should be reduced on the basis of objective criteria,
Logical bulks of powers, the ability to synergies
create. The proliferation of legal entities, the transparency of
operation complicate the administration (funds, associations, individual abilities ....)
must be scrutinized and cleaned up dramatically. Before yet
proceeding to the creation of new entities must be thoroughly checked
be objective criteria.
A major problem of the Flemish government is that it operates compartmentalised. Many Flemish
entities of the Flemish government stand side by side and sometimes contradict each other, much to the
frustration of citizens, companies, associations and local authorities on their services
have been designated. The juxtaposed structure, sometimes there is no line in the Flemish government
and policy is coherent, effective and efficient services to look far.

1229.

sp.a wants the Flemish government better cooperate between the different
entities within a single policy, but also across the policy.
This requires also screened with the regulatory and, where necessary, simplified and
be coherent.

1230.

The Flemish departments must take up their role in the field of
coordination of policy, negotiation and evaluation of
the management of agencies and outlining the policy,
partly based on the approach taken by the agencies. The policy councils must -
also before that - be more dynamic. This should not lead to an under sp.a
reintroduction of strict pyramidal hierarchy within the policy as
that used to exist. Agencies and entities have a framed
retain autonomy, with freedom in responsibility.

1231.

sp.a wants the entire Flemish government, sees himself more as a whole:
The group Flemish government. Initiatives should be taken in order to
strengthen team spirit, to among others by officers following internships
at various Flemish services through networking events and internal
campaigns. Socialist Party officials will also encourage them throughout their careers
switch between entities.

1232.

The purpose of the enhanced group and the increased sense of co-operation is
For sp.a simple: end users (individuals, companies, associations,
Local Authorities) in a coherent, clear and effective service
offer. A service where the end user is not confronted
with the complex structure of the Flemish government but could go to one
counter, in a first stage, one counter for each target group. The service is provided
properly and respect the deadlines foreseen in the regulations.

1233.

The Flemish government has historically grown, prepared and regulatory tasks
undertaken which one can ask whether this anno 2014 still needed
is. The time for a thorough self-assessment in this area has come. Many of these
278

powers can be exercised better locally. That is more in line with
subsidiarity and offers opportunities to reduce the administrative burden for
citizen to shrink. Examples of Flemish powers to a lower
level government belong include childcare, retirement homes, housing projects, local
health, prevention, doctor consultation, planning and aspects
labor market guidance.
So it would be for the services to citizens, companies and associations have been better if some
of powers that now are Flemish autonomous manner could be exercised by local
governments. Albeit within an overall framework set by the Flemish government.
Such 'framed' decentralization has in fact already occurred in countries with very
effective and efficient government, such as the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland.

1234.

The Flemish government zeroes numerous powers to better according sp.a
the local level can be exercised. At the lower levels of government can
the policy more responsive to specific local needs and the trust of the
population in the board increases. The foregoing implies that the Flemish
government must transfer the powers and the entire accompanying budget
to local authorities.

Rating 8.5 Local government: stronger together
Municipalities inspire people tend to be more confident than any other level of government. About
the municipal level they are most satisfied. That is not illogical. The municipal level
enjoy first and foremost a strong democratic legitimacy: the local elections have much
media attention, and once elected mayors and aldermen are sharply followed
the press. Also reports of councils often appear in the press.
Moreover, the inhabitants of municipalities get their local representatives to the streets of their
town or city. The proximity between elected officials and their constituents is so large. That will mean that local
Politicians tend solution-oriented thinking, and especially to look for workable
answers to the problems that arise. They must, after all, itself, along with the other
residents of their city or community living in the place where they drive. That proximity,
democratic responsibility and solution-oriented gestoelde confidence of people is
Besides not only a characteristic of small communities but also of great cities.
Cities and municipalities have the ability to the lives of their citizens very concrete better
make. For example through parks, playgrounds, bike paths, safe streets, adequate
parking, events, cultural, neighborhood and youth. And of course via personal
accents in the local social welfare policy. That ability is beautifully reflected in the revival and beautification
of several cities that formerly drab, desolate, unsightly or unsafe, such as Antwerp,
Mechelen, Ghent and Leuven.

1235.

sp.a acknowledges that the municipal level is the best level in the field of
democratic legitimacy, proximity and capacity to their welfare

life to make people better through government policy, it is local

The development of a broad palette local policy is not easy. It requires adequate fiscal and
other income, highly qualified and motivated staff and many managerial know-how.
A congregation without sufficient financial capacity, without well-trained workers or
professional operation, things may indeed beredderen. But quality policies that are designed to

Thus it is that many mostly small communities, with little ability to pay tax, smaller
offerings to provide services to their residents, while larger municipalities thanks

easier to offer a full service package. It is regrettable that not every
inhabitant of the country can enjoy the full potential that the municipal policy
carries within itself. Some can enjoy excellent service in many
policies, while others can not.

1236.

The ability of municipal policies to human life
more pleasant and make better, is great. Well cared communal
services in the various areas of municipal
powers, can make a big difference in your life. It is, therefore, for

policies are capable of. These communities do what they can and provide
their residents a sense of accessible government, but have little policy
elbow room.

The disparity between residents of different municipalities that entail the above
brings, is a thorn in the side of sp.a. It is a structural inequality
cooperation and solidarity between municipalities could be eliminated. Such
cooperation would make it possible for anyone, anywhere in Flanders a minimum set
to ensure high quality local services. That is not at all the case today.

1237.

Different size, fiscal capacity and administrative strength of Flemish
municipalities brings certain inequality between municipalities and their residents with
entails. Depending on geographical coincidences help determine whether someone

not. That municipalities are small does not necessarily mean that the service

unacceptable, and should, where necessary, be resolved through financial solidarity
and municipal cooperation on a larger scale. What is essential for us,
is that everyone can enjoy a municipal service that are being

Cases are, especially for small and financially weak communities still much sharper focus,
by a number of recent acute conditions. First and foremost, there are the obligations that the
New Flemish administrative reporting system from 2014 entails, called
BBC (Policy and Management Cycle). BBC decree requires each municipality and each CPAS to a
term plan, a budget, accounts and financial statements to make. That precise
reporting obligations, and the legal duty to a structurally balanced budget in 2019
achieve results in some municipalities are clearly aware of their financial
limits. They can no longer go unnoticed beyond their means, as in the past sometimes
happened. The red numbers in the exploitation of their community be mercilessly visible and
can not be ignored.
If we also add that pension costs for local officials will rise very sharply
and the economic crisis is leading to less revenue, is the inescapable conclusion that some
the municipalities in the coming years will have to do with much less. The Association of Cities
and Municipalities (VVSG) has already announced that this harsh situation will lead to a reduction of
the municipal staff with several thousand employees, a strong reduction of
local investment and also to an impending reduction of services.
The only way to serve the people - and in particular the social
weak - still maintain or improve is to look for
efficiency gains by intermunicipal cooperation and / or scaling. All services

The new regulatory and financial reporting requirements for municipalities,
rising pension costs for municipalities and the tax consequences of the
economic crisis, entail that municipalities throughout Flanders
will have to make do with less. For service up to standard
Keep municipalities and CPAS should seek efficiency gains through
cooperation on a higher scale. Additional efficiency gains can
be made by inclusion of certain services, for example, in the field of
personnel and IT policy or financial management.

These inter-municipal cooperation is happening now ad hoc and related to specific
topics. At first glance there is nothing against such a free negotiated
partnerships, but a closer look at are at least three problems. First fall
voluntary, self-selected partnerships weak and impoverished communities often from
boat. Municipalities would tend for obvious reasons not to work together voluntarily
281

with church who have little or nothing to offer. Secondly, the voluntary ad hoc
inter-municipal cooperation, the problem that it is extremely fragmented, with no
systematics and therefore confusing. They do not contribute to the clarity and transparency of the
government, on the contrary. Thirdly, it is usually almost no democratic control of these
intermunicipal partnerships.
We can conclude that these ad hoc PICs, which were born out of necessity, proof
its administrative power of the failing of some municipalities. The partnerships are sometimes
a means much less social, effective, efficient and democratic than a merger or
merging of municipalities.
Such mergers of municipalities should not, as in the merger in the 70s, happen
on the basis of subjective and political criteria. They may only be based on objective criteria
are. We think of population, size and ability to pay tax. The merger operation
aims to make every town large enough and strong management to a full-fledged
policies to be able to carry. A policy that makes a difference in people's lives.
To prevent the local government would be too far removed from people and their local
environment, come proximity control at village or district level. These boards have a
budget to serve the very local interests and to solve problems.

1239.

Many municipalities have by their inherently limited administrative capacity and by
financial situation, forced to work together in many areas with other
municipalities. This cooperation is now done point by point and on a voluntary basis

occurs, then its implementation must be based on objective criteria

1241.
sp.a is sensitive to the specific situation of cities. These have own
needs and problems that require a focused urban policy. Moreover
those same big cities have a sufficient administrative capacity to own
control capacity to develop. The foregoing implies that a number of Flemish
and Provincial powers should be transferred to those cities. For
282 a number of challenges to land use planning, housing and mobility tax

Today there is a proliferation of inter-municipal partnerships. This is partly
do with the fact that today many municipalities are not large and powerful enough to board
to perform their duties independently. On the other hand, the fulfillment of certain contracts is simply
cheaper and more efficient to exercise at a higher inter-municipal level. For example in the
in energy and water supply, sanitation, sewerage, crematoria and bulky

intermunicipal cooperation.
All in all, the dense and confusing tangle of intercommunal several disadvantages:
they are usually monitored very flawed democracy in the councils of the
constituent municipalities, which they bring very many paid directorships with himself and
that they are very transparent in terms of their income, gains, losses and dividends.
To make the structure of local administration more transparent and democratic, the number should
PICs sink dramatically. This will partly be done automatically if the fusion of
municipalities occurs to large powerful government entities. If every town large enough
its main tasks autonomously exercise will naturally much intercommunal
partnerships are needed. The big intermunicipal utilities (energy and
water supply, sanitation, sewerage, crematoria) often work well and should continue
exist.
Intermunicipal that remain after the merger and expansion of municipalities have off
their superfluous directorships. The Flemish Minister for Energy managed to get the number
directorships in letting the sector of gas and electricity fall from more than 1200
to less than 500. A also such a downsizing operation imposes itself in the sector of the
housing, water, waste and sewage.

sp.a wants the aldermen representing the municipality in the
intercommunal required to be extended on a half yearly basis
accountable to the council about what they are in the
intercommunal discussed or decided. This measure increases the
democratic control and efficiency of the government.
sp.a does not want the provinces disappear. Provinces have over the years a useful
expertise in the field of services to municipalities, for example in the field
environmental policy. It would be inefficient to that knowledge and experience being lost. Therefore
it seems appropriate to make a relatively autonomous expertise of the province

1245.
sp.a wants to maintain the provincial level. It houses a large experience and
expertise in providing expert advice and quality services
municipalities. Therefore, the province should function as a center of expertise and
public service company to maintain municipalities.
The provinces can not only assist individual municipalities to advise and assist in the accomplishment of
some difficult tasks that grow them over the head, but can also supramunicipal
