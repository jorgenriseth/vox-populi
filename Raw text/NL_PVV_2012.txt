Foreword
Dear friends of liberty,
It's an ancient Chinese curse: may you live in interesting times. In 2012 life
we are in interesting times. Many of the challenges are enormous Netherlands: our loss
to sovereignty, the constant growth of Islam, the poor economic situation,
erosion of care and care of our elderly, the bizarre choices of Kunduz.
But the crisis of the Netherlands goes beyond the walker which our seniors now
have to pay. Our 'interesting times' mainly relate to the total
the absence of any compass. Are we still a country that wants to govern themselves? Form
We are a nation that is master of its own territory? We find that we are our own first
sick and elderly should take care of and then the rest of the world?
What is our story?
In this election, we present our choices for the Netherlands in 2017.
As always, we are pragmatic and patriotic. Other parties choose Islam or EUnationalisme; we opt for the Netherlands.
The choice is clear, and reflected in the titles of the chapters that follow:
their Brussels versus our economy, our welfare, our freedom, our security,
our immigration policy, our care, our quality of life, our countries, our environment and
our finances.
We will fight against the EU nationalism.
In 2010 we wrote in our election manifesto, "until the elections nine men strong,
then hopefully more. That wish came true: Voted half million compatriots
Freedom Party. A crushing victory. We were the third party in the Netherlands,
with 24 seats.
We are Dutch and so we believe that tomorrow is better than today. Being afraid is
others. Therefore I close here with: after these elections, hopefully with more than 24 seats.
Let's make the impossible come true.
We are ready. We are looking forward to it. From the swamp! From the EU! The euro!

"We decide something. We bring it in and then wait some time to see what happens. Will there be no outcry,
no rebellion breaks out - most still do not understand what is decided - then we go back a little further.
Step by step until there is no return possible. "
Jean-Claude Juncker
Prime Minister of Luxembourg and President of the Eurogroepi

Their Brussels
It should however be once completed.
In recent decades we have witnessed the slow erosion of our freedom and
independence. A proud people swimming in a fish trap which is becoming more pressing. We
are lured into it by progressive elites promised us prosperity and made us afraid
for the alternative: economic ruin and war. Who can count resisting at
the gray twisted LP of leftist journalists and left-wing politicians: that is xenophobic,
populist, or wants to hide behind the dikes. Most preferably, all three.
But the eurosceptic sound is deeply rooted in our people. Prime Minister Willem
Drees felt well. Nothing he saw in the sale of our power.
He wanted the movement of persons, immigration and so, in his own hand was houden.ii Drees
a true Eurosceptic. He made sure that our country was a self-conscious sleeper in
negotiations with the other countries of the European experiment.
Was he too xenophobic, populist, from behind the dykes?
Of course not. He was a patriot, who relied on the power of Dutch. Which
believed in the power of our people. Why would he squander our independence
we just had with so much blood and tears regained?
But the vision of Drees was abandoned for reckless road-with-us-idealism. So wild
they pick up the entire third world to our country. So our power was extradited to
Brussels and so it was exporting our wealth to Greece, Bulgaria and Romania.
Otherwise, we get war - lie the elites.

PVV election 2012 - 2017 | Their Brussels, our Netherlands

These are just a few questions: if we were being penniless without the EU, why are non-EU countries such as Norway, Switzerland and Israel be so rich? And why donates Netherlands
7 billion each year in Brussels, while our elders have pajama days and they have their own
walker should fund? Have they built Netherlands after the war, or Greek
jokke chunks?
We Dutch are a trading nation. No country was for centuries as international
oriented as ours. Our flag waves for centuries on all continents and all
oceans. Therefore economic cooperation is always in our interest. The European
Economic Community, EEC, was also an excellent idea. Countries
similar culture who work economically is fine. But this project was hijacked
by people who adhered to the Greater European idea and came up with a
superstate. The only chance we had us make a ruling, the referendum
In 2005, ended in a resounding victory for the eurosceptics - with the Group Wilders
as the engine of the resistance. Naturally Hague drew nothing from it and pressed it
throttle towards destruction even deeper in.
Now we get a rude awakening.
We are no longer masters of our own house. We are a guest in their own country; no longer capable of
to determine our own future, but impotent spectators of on Dutch policy,
while EU nationalists celebrate and enjoy everlasting lunches. There is no
terrain to invent what we are not violated by the blind inhabitants of the ivory
towers in Brussels.
First as small as a telling example: the Hedwige polder. Centuries fought
We Dutch against the sea. So we built a swampy marsh delta into a
prosperous nation. Brussels bureaucrats to tell us that we are submerged polders
should continue. Pardon? Which Dutchman's there now serve? No one, of course.
But it has to Brussels, so sleepwalking the Kunduz coalition obedient there
back, unwilling to iron their masters against the hair. And so we're going to do something
a brutal insult to our history and our national character: a polder underwater
put.
Equally worrying is the changing demographics. RIVM
some shocking pictures taken: maps of the Netherlands, which we print after this
chapter. At each spot, we see immigrants, an increasing proportion of the population
part. In practice this means: more and more Islamic, more and more headscarves,
increasing criminality, poverty, welfare dependence and medieval
views. A people that is boss makes domestically yourself who enters and
who does not. Dutch but we see every day increase the influx. Who should
that? Ms Malmstr√∂m, an unelected multicultural Eurocrat who has the power
about our immigration policy. Dutch ministers are no longer the boss. Our
Ministers must begging with hat in hand to Brussels or we ourselves have some influence
may have on our immigration. The answer invariably is: 'jet'. Our parliament
is utterly powerless. It is the proof that you do not Europhile and democrat
can be at the same time.

PVV election 2012 - 2017 | Their Brussels, our Netherlands

When the PVV opened a hotline for nuisance and displacement by Central and Eastern Europeans turned our website overtime. We must open our labor market
For Poles, Romanians and Bulgarians is yet another Brussels diktat that we slavishly
must obey. On the street we see the inconvenience. Many Dutch construction worker
or truck is driven out by a cheap Pool. But the
elites in Brussels see anything. They give their driver assignment with a large bow at the
immigrant neighborhoods to drive to. The plebs should integrate, not them.
The EU has many nightmares in store for us: it is for example in Brussels
working hard to make Turkey a member. This means that the Islamic country Turkey
after Germany gets the most number of members in the euro parliament. Then we have no
any opportunity to stop the influx of millions of Turks. There are the
crazy CO2 measures, which are a disaster for Schiphol and KLM and for our
industry. Companies must make soon 30 percent of their transport by water or rail. There
come quotas that force companies to take percentages of women in employment. ACTA
EU lays the internet freedom restricted. The Galileo satellite navigation system
probably billions charges before the power goes out. And so it goes
by. Euro-bobo Juncker is right: step by step - until there is no return possible.
Hollow spherical EU needs more money. Barroso wants the budget for 2013 once more
increase by almost 7 percent! Then EU budget more than 1 billion euro in 7 years.
But the Netherlands is something else. The Kunduz coalition will cut them hard - on
command in Brussels. Of course it is good to limit government spending. However, or in
our own pace, without having to cut things piece. But serve the Kunduz puppets
especially the EU and not the citizens. Therefore, the VAT goes up, the unloaded disappears
kilometric, gas and electricity are much more expensive, the mortgage interest deduction
addressed and increase the deductibles in health care to colossal height. Rollators need our
the elderly pay for itself. Kunduz, thanks. Brussels, thanks.
The biggest Brussels madness project called 'euro'. The thinking is, different cultures,
economies and budgets, but a common currency. The problem is that all those
countries differ from one another and thus, for example require a separate interest level. Already
which different economies can not impose unity regime, which is ultimately
bad for everyone: one size fits none. In Greece we see where that leads. The country
economically heeling. When Iceland was in the same boat could his own coin
devalue. That boosted exports and tourism to and within no time the country was again in
the leg. However, Greece is stuck in jail and Brussels have the same currency and
interest rate as the rest of the eurozone.
Brussels also wants to control Netherlands in detail. The arrangement exists regarding "macroeconomic imbalances." If the structure of our economy, our Brussels
bosses do not like, we get punished. Thus, the unelected European Commissioner Olli Rehn
A list of urgent advice delivered to his male children in The Hague. This states
For example, the mortgage interest deduction should be abolished. If we are not there
and meet our deficit remains too high, according to Brussels, we can expect a fine of
1.2 billion. Bye, bye freedom.
For two years raises the Freedom Party that Greece out of the euro needs. So weird
it not? Who does not respect the rules, the statistics systematically falsified and
itself acts a bankruptcy itself must sit on the blisters.
12

PVV election 2012 - 2017 | Their Brussels, our Netherlands

For two years, the PVV was dissipated. How dare they to so questions to
put on the holy Great European project? These xenophobic populists anyway - you see they
hiding behind the dikes. But Europhiles who cried for years are now a
lot quieter.
While the Titanic already makes heel, Netherlands keeps going forward with money.
The Minister assured us time and again that we get back from the Greeks the money -
with interest. He probably also believes in fairies and the tooth fairy.
The capstone of the lifting of the Netherlands as an independent nation is the ESM. It means
the total assimilation of our country within the Greater European superstate. We hit the
power over our treasury completely lost. The bureaucrats need only-clicking and our
Finance Minister gireert. Hunter jumps to attention. Brussels should recommend
Indeed, to be blindly followed.
Why? Because we are stuck with a rope around our necks to countries with a total
another culture. In the Netherlands we live according to 'frugality diligently builds houses as
castles. Other cultures are more focused on: quickly retired, and evade tax
enjoying the sun with a drink.
Accession to the EU, some countries see as unlimited access to a hole in the wall. In
Romania laugh themselves silly at all the stupid Dutchmen remain indorse in Greece
they take another ouzootje courtesy of Henk and Ingrid, in Bulgaria they are only too happy
their gypsies moving to our streets.
When ABN Amro and other Dutch banks went bankrupt and in trouble
threatened to go, then came a phone call from Athens where our hands were
edged? The Greeks then sent ships loaded with billions? There was then an emergency fund
Netherlands? Of course not. The essence of the European dream is that our money towards
the south and east flows. Not vice versa.
She lusts, we charges.
Dutch are supposed to think in 'Europe' with all kinds of high quality, pink things:
international cooperation, solidarity and peace. In Romania, they think only:
how much money we can really take away before those dumb Dutchmen wake.
But waking up is exactly what the Dutch people is doing. And the progressive
elites find it terrible.
This is the question we have to answer September 12 we are proud, independent
citizens who decide about our future? Whether we are helpless spectators a
applause machine forms unelected bureaucrats like Mr Barroso, Van Rompuy, Juncker,
Rehn, Malmstr√∂m - or how all these apparatchiks may also be called.
Europhile or Democrat. Dutch freedom or slavery Brussels. Voluntary cooperation
or Barroso orders. The euro and the guilder. Self build castles or continue to indorse
Greece.

13

PVV election 2012 - 2017 | Their Brussels, our Netherlands

On September 12 Netherlands provides the answer. Our interests are called Netherlands, then
Netherlands and then another Netherlands. Everyone has their own culture, their own decisions,
own accounts, its own responsibilities. Private blisters.
We are the only ones who say, from that trap. The rope around our necks which binds us to the
Eurocrats and geldsmijters must go.
We are the only ones who tell the unelected Eurocrats: your end is our beginning. You
dream is our nightmare. Your loss is our gain.
We are the only ones who say it should just be once completed. Now own boss
country.
Our flag is red, white and blue.
From the EU. From the euro.

And especially:
No ESM. The European Financial Stability Brussels gives absolute power over 40 billion
our budget. Not so nice.

Our economy
The coming years, we must do everything to get our economy going again
to get. The Freedom Party believes in small government, low taxes and so
the fewest lines. Coupled with the preservation of our national sovereignty, a
population that is not divided by mass immigration, and sound public finances
it still provides the best recipe for economic growth. The diktat from Brussels
to cut the broken economy (target: already in 2013 a budget deficit of 3 per cent)
the trash can. The PVV wants to pass in 2015, below the 3 percent and eventually to
balanced budget.
Kunduz is not going to help us out of the euro crisis. The five parties betting on higher VAT, a
commuter tax, higher taxes, freezing the tax brackets; all of which
inhibit the growth. The approach of the mortgage put the housing market even more solid.
Thousands of people in the construction industry will lose their jobs. The Kunduz package makes hard
the wrong choices. It does not cut the fat from the government. The package consists of 9.1
billion higher expenses. Only 1.8 billion being cut by the government.
Nice and easy.

18

PVV election 2012 - 2017 | Their Brussels, our Netherlands

The PVV wants Netherlands not cut broken, but chooses to cut public and
tax cuts for individuals and businesses. That should boost the economy again.
The Party for Freedom wants to make government smaller. And thus stop things like
development aid, payments to the EU, the financing of the Antilles, peacekeeping missions,
art subsidies and various sustainability grants, such as solar panels and red diesel.
We also want fewer officers and we delete the expat scheme. We triple
with pleasure the bank tax.
The Freedom Party protects such things as social security. That is our choice: stand
for the people who can most use a helping hand. In these tough times
a safety net is essential! We prefer to let bleed the government.
The Freedom Party holds the retirement age at 65 and by applying a
real interest rate of 4% pensions remain unchanged. Also, let's WW and the
severance intact. In addition, we opt for enforcement of the mortgage.
Of course we put Brussels on bread and water. So no Dutch Euros to EU
EFSF, ECB etc. Meanwhile there are 3.2 billion Dutch money lost to Greece.
And we stand for a further 27 billion euros for guarantees. That money is water to the sea
wear. Of course we shall not 40 billion available to the ESM, the permanent
emergency fund. After all, we are already up to 100 billion in the EFSF?
Economic freedom and confidence in their own strength for centuries have demonstrated growth.
We get back when we become master over our own economy, so away from the EU.
Free trade we arrange ourselves with other countries.
And of course, we go back to the guilder. The renowned research
Lombard Street Research has selected the Euro 1800 euros per Dutch
purchasing power costs. We can no longer afford us. Own currency means weather
own interest. Weather customized for the Netherlands.
The Freedom Party chooses to stimulate domestic demand. Henk and Ingrid
must be able to spend more. Therefore, the PVV opts for lower taxes and reduce
the tax on energy. Commuter tax disappears; Cook of the penny we give back
by lowering the gasoline and diesel tax by as much as 12 cents. The excise duty also
LPG goes down. The corporate income tax for companies large and small are
also down.

And especially:

We citizens are not there for you to fund undemocratic Toko. Find more
even how the Eighty Years War began. (Hint: it started the tenth
penny, a load of the European superstate of those days.)

21

Our welfare state
These are harsh economic times. You have no crystal ball to foresee that
still comes much trouble. Therefore, it is now important to get the safety net in order that our
compatriots to protect against economic blow waves that will affect our country.
More and more Dutch risk losing their jobs, for shorter or longer periods. In
many families means that a small disaster: how the mortgage, who pays
the accounts for the children, the car should be out the door? Our compatriots
not adopted the euro crisis, but have to pay the bill there for. The least
we can do is make sure that they can catch their breath and find another job
find.
Therefore chooses the Freedom Party outspoken in defense of our
welfare. This choice automatically leads to a rejection of mass immigration,
which cost us 7.2 billion euros per year. Finally, it is to give. Whether you're going around
world of benefits or features you choose unequivocally for your own people.
The Freedom Party leaves no doubt on which side it is on. This
separates us from leftists who think that open doors and a solid welfare state
go well together. We stop giving expensive benefits to newcomers. The
For example, assistance has become an immigrant-hangout. We think: Migrants
have 10 years in the Netherlands to work for them to get right to social benefits.

22

PVV election 2012 - 2017 | Their Brussels, our Netherlands

Another assault on our welfare state that must be repulsed those of the is
EU superstate. It's simple: our people, we defend ourselves. We have no
Brussels costly socialist device required. Even with this, we are diametrically
front left dreaming of a 'social Europe'. Ronald van Raak, ideologist of the
Socialist Party wants "we will ensure that Europe's environmental problems
Solving that will make the social rules that the social security system
Europe is going to make ".iii yet more socialism. More rules. More red
nightmares.
The Party for Freedom prefer the 'socially Netherlands. That means, for example
that we do not open our labor market for cheap Romanians and Bulgarians here
outcompete our people. Labour migration is by definition temporary. Or: end
contract = end stay.
Our senior citizens should not be penalized by the euro crisis. They have the land
built in guilders, they now have to pay the price in euros? Oh no! The Party for the
Freedom therefore fights for the retirement and pensions. "From pulling Drees' we continue to do
from 65 years. For pensions, we use a real interest rate of 4 percent
so massively 'stamp' is no longer an issue.
Unemployment remains unchanged. Who loses his job is entitled to benefits. The
Freedom Party leaves the WW whatsoever as long and as high as now, like the
severance. Workers are not disposable napkins. So fighting the Party for
Freedom for years and years for dismissal. Question of civilization.
Abuse of social services is tackled hard. By checks and by
severe penalties. Tampering? Violence at a social security agency? No more benefit!
Of course there will be intensively monitored for second homes in Morocco
Turkey. In your homeland to build a palace and enjoy a benefit - we make
jubilant end. We send teams down the coffee shops for inspection.
We stand for the sheltered workshops and turning all the cuts back to this.
Here works the weakest in the mainstream business have no chance.
They deserve our support. The Law Works to Power is not entered.
We are against the bonus culture. The gesmijt with money in the public sector has a
disastrous impact on public morality. And more than the Balkenende norm does not
to be earned in the public sector.
Also, we do not accept additional rent increases above inflation. So no 5 percent
additional rent increase for families with incomes above 43,000 euros and no one
percent rent increase for families who earn more than 33,000.
Very important: alimony is what the Party for Freedom does not
last forever. Who is separate, must be desolate forever. Therefore, the PVV late
alimony but take up to five years instead of twelve.

Our freedom
More freedom means less and less EU Islam. The European Union is in its essence a
totalitarian project. Speaks very justly Soviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky about the EUSSR, the
European Union as a reincarnation of the Soviet Union, the USSR.
If Italians want crucifixes in schools hang up, or if a Dutch hotline
nuisance start MOE-landers, they get the wind in front of Brussels. And you bet
our progressive friends eager to put all criticism of Islam curtailed.
We must of course all to go and make clear that their Brussels nothing
do with our freedom.
Another threat is the advance of Islam. This ideology is diametrically opposed to freedom. Not
just for her fans, but for the entire Western world. Progressive politicians
willing to make this totalitarian philosophy of the meaning. The Party for Freedom
says a centimeter space for Islam in the Netherlands. That means that with pleasure
the triumph of Islam in our streets to go: the minarets, the burqas, the
scarves etc. Who needs such matters may well back. Please do so.
26

PVV election 2012 - 2017 | Their Brussels, our Netherlands

Something else. The Holocaust must be remembered nationally. Therefore, on January 27
(the day of the liberation of Auschwitz) in the continuation of the National Memorial Day
Holocaust held, including the flag at half-mast.
Privacy is crucial for us. Big Brother Father State already know a lot of us, and wants much
more of us know: ACTA to CCTV and DigiNotar. The Party for Freedom
like to draw a line. Privacy must be guaranteed. A breach can only take place
if this is legally tightly regulated.
Freedom of expression should be guaranteed. The PVV is therefore for the
introduction of a first amendment to the American model.
Our government is far more democratic and far more effective. Such Upper House
Of course awfully picturesque, but in 2012 one knows yet why this national
bedroom exists. For example, we can abolish more business. Please send fewer MPs, fewer officers, fewer tiers. Of course, we make an end
that municipalities conduct their own immigration and failed asylum liars
refuse to turn.
Citizens must have more say. Our crown jewel is called the binding referendum.
Hot issues we would like to explain to the population. The progressive elites
terrified by the voice of the people. We do not. Set the polling stations open, but late
Dutch vote on eg the multicultural society of the Grand European Empire. Bet left always loses?
The Freedom Party says to give. Who holds a second passport there after,
chooses not to mince Netherlands. Such a person is also due obedience
in another country. For example, a Turk can not condemn the Armenian Genocide.
In other words he can not speak freely and is therefore unusable in a Dutch parliament or

Our security
"Wilders always calls us D66 voters and I believe the majority also agrees D66." Better
We could not have put it. It was said by Tom Schalkeniv, deputy judge of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam. That juristendom sided tilting
to the left we can see every day. Therefore, the leader of the PVV stood trial
for his critical views of Islam and will never D66'er party comrades-in-gown
be held accountable for the sale of Netherlands. Therefore sent
Minister Hirsch Ballin evening the police off in which the cartoonist Gregorius Nekschot
ventured to put Islam in his shirt. And that's why so many criminals get away with
community service or warning. Shortly state Volkert van der Graaf on the street,
a symbolic strafje was convicted by a judge who was also active for
Refugee Nederland.v
In this way we get our streets obviously never safe. With unwilling dogs the
chase bad.
Meanwhile, we see that all is not well with the fight against crime. The crime
hardens. The number of violent crimes rises and rises. Increasingly brutal violence
used. That also depends on the import of people from cultures where flat violence
often is accepted.

Judges should really come to understand that the Netherlands wants harsher penalties. Therefore wants
The Party for Freedom minimum sentences. For example a rapist at least
ten years behind bars goes is surely the least we can expect. Heavy
assault: 20 years. After three serious violent crimes lifetime: three strikes and you're out.
We will also accumulate penalties. So who commits two murders and gets two penalty
which is also both off, one after the other. Who wants customers to discount, but goes to the supermarket.
Prisons are not holiday resorts. It may be in jail a lot less luxurious
then in the nursing home. Our guests provide itself naturally in the cost of their
stay. They will then work long hours. Early in the morning to work and very late again
back on the cell.
We like to see appear the chain gang in the Dutch streets. Yummy
along the way to work in a cheerful pink suit. Because many harness is taken from
shame cultures that additional cuts in.
Failure by members of the judges and magistrates have gone. The PVV wants
democratic control: judges are appointed not for life but for ten
years. For justices of the Supreme Court be organized elections.
Let Dutch choose whom a supreme court judge them.
The police serve the citizen and not vice versa. The police, the safety of our
and guarantee our children. Therefore no emergency police, but a police action. Not too
much emphasis on procedures, but simple rules, so that more blue to the street.
The police are again boss on the streets. Naturally, our cops are selected
decisiveness. People with a preference for geitenwollensokken apply only in the
community center.
Many more crimes and crimes to be solved. Now that is only a quarter,
but it definitely toward 50 percent. In Germany succeed with this. The system must also
overhead down. There are too many people to give up the lead agency, and we see
far too few police on the streets.

Our immigration policy
In our last election Diary Hope and Optimism we quoted
approvingly Theo van Gogh. He wrote about Job Cohen that his attitude
Moroccans: "You belong to us." Van Gogh wondered: "What are you doing here?"
Anyone who has ever spent a few minutes at one of the sites where our hate
Islamic culture creamers leave their opinion understands Van Gogh's wisdom
stance. Indeed, what are they doing here? Who has admitted and must
we are even more out here?
The Dutch people are paying a terrible price for the lack of patriotism
a generation of politically correct politicians. Just when they had to defend
our people, they fell vulgar way-with-us-idealism. The floodgates were opened for
Hundreds of thousands of Muslims, for lured with jobs, benefits, housing and
education. The consequences are disastrous. By now everybody understands this.
34

PVV election 2012 - 2017 | Their Brussels, our Netherlands

Islam is not part of the Netherlands. Which will be an eternal source of unrest. Abraham
Kuyper knew a hundred years ago: "The Muslim may have other nations
predominate, even this is their privilege and vocation, but they themselves are not eligible to strange
authority subject ".vi
Islam is not a religion but a totalitarian political ideology with here and there
a religious touch. Our freedoms and our history are committed to that ideology
fight, as we that we should do with all totalitarian ideologies.
Mass immigration is intensely damaging to the Netherlands. Beyond the problems with
Islam that we have imported now, we see an overrepresentation of
non-western immigrants in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãbenefit dependency, anti-Semitism,
gay hate, discrimination against women, crime, nuisance, school failure and honor killings.
Non-western immigrants costs Netherlands 7.2 billion euros per year.
Therefore, we must stop the immigration of people from Muslim countries.
Repatriation is a virtue. So we throw criminals with a non-Dutch
nationality immediately and we say goodbye to foreigners who are not job
have 'work or get out.
Every four or five years a general amnesty is obviously insane. People refuse after a
refusal to leave, then organizes the state actions to these objectors
as pathetic to portray, backed by leftist funded activist groups. The result is then
becoming yet another billion-consuming amnesty. We want a law which
impossible. A law against amnesty.

And especially:

Our concern
The concern is all of us. We trust ourselves and our loved ones to the almost
one and a half million health professionals with heart and soul to exercise their profession. A lot
demanded of them. More colleagues with better qualifications are more than welcome. Let
Agema the funds (12 000 extra hands on the bed) anyway intact.
The Kunduz coalition is completely on the wrong track with the bizarre increase in equity
risk introducing 'demurrage' in the hospital and the plan to let the walker itself
pay. We do of course understand also that healthcare costs. However, there is still a lot of money
To save without anyone caring lost or have to pay more. Indeed, often
we get better quality care in return.
One example is bringing closer the people of homecare. That is qualitatively better,
without the overhead and has the added advantage of also another much cheaper
is. That includes funding the care on outcomes rather than supply.
Smaller healthcare facilities, the reining in long-term secondment and leave
performing simple medical interventions by general practitioners, are so a few points
which make the care cheaper and at the same time better.
38

PVV election 2012 - 2017 | Their Brussels, our Netherlands

We're also not as the bureaucracy, the suffocating rules or care bigwigs.
The number of part-time jobs is restricted. There will also be a key driver, which measures advance
whether someone is suitable. As we break through the carousel of dysfunctional managers.
Also, healthcare administrators will be held jointly and severally liable with demonstrable
misrule.
In early 2012 we started the pilot project "rule, poor health care," an initiative
of the Freedom Party. Now do thirty healthcare with, but it must
basically everyone will apply. Get rid of the stifling rules.
Then there are the layers of management: overhead. The Party for Freedom wants more hands
on the bed, not behind the desk. Enter therefore a norm. The number of managers
a third reduction may be fine. The money saved can go back to where it is needed:
the workplace.
Bizarre natural that criminals in prison are better off than residents
care institutions. Prisoners are entitled to one hour airing a day, two times three
fifteen sports per week plus recreation. Also free clothing and shoes, salary, smoking
in their own room. Our people in nursing homes can only there
dream of. The PVV says: give residents of care facilities and rights of suit
prisoners off. So we are a step in the right direction.
Instead of many times to come back to the hospital, we have to move towards OneStop-visits. Hospitals short on their budget if they let people needlessly coming back.
Get better doctors. And for more doctors. Therefore we phase out the numerus
fixus at universities down.
One of the Kunduz plan is: the 'freelancer extramuraliseren 1-3 new cases per 1
January 2013 '. Nobody understands anything about it. But it means abolishing
homes. From 2013 come very elderly who have difficulty walking, no more
take care of themselves and have no one to care for them, not there
more. They would have to get home care they have also in the nursing home.
But the reality is that these people often no longer live at home. Some
even day and night care. These are after all often people of eighty
and older who often can no longer care for themselves. In order to prevent that they
languish, lonely and pollute there homes. Therefore, the
Freedom Party retained.

Our quality of life
Education is an important task of the government. For example, to our culture a
next generation to pass. But equally important is that making education
ensures that we have the best educated workforce. For a country without too much
natural resources is a necessity.
In recent years we have seen that education is a lot of loose
its core task: simple knowledge transfer. Huge education molochen thick
management layers, which has become now the better for it? Amarantis, InHolland, DRILL;
these are just a few names that illustrate that something is fundamentally wrong. Many schools
excelled in new buildings, real estate and shiny leaflets. That is the
wrong priorities.
The Freedom Party looks like small schools. Where the student is not an anonymous
number is, but where he feels at home. New mergers is no question where
possible is properly unbundled, particularly in HBO and MBO.
Education is not for fun. Good teachers is respected by students and parents.
No 'you' and 'you' more in the classroom but 'you' and 'sir'. Better education begins with better
teachers. Teacher training programs should deliver much better teachers. People with more knowledge,
which can better teach. At the primary school literacy and numeracy are central.
42

PVV election 2012 - 2017 | Their Brussels, our Netherlands

Our teachers are proud of the Netherlands and Western civilization. They are happy lesson
in national history and tell about the blackest page in our history:
the Holocaust. Muslim objections to not be honored. Anthem, flag.
All right.
There is a glaring shortage of skilled workers: mechanics, welders, measuring and
control engineers, construction workers etc. Engineering will be getting plenty of attention, even in elementary school.
The trade school is crucial.
We maintain the student for the Bachelor phase; we maintain the public transport card.
Even if you do not have a rich daddy D66'er is you can study. So the financial needs
thresholds as low as possible. We also run the economy on the appropriate education
back.
The money that schools must receive a minimum of 80 per cent to education itself
be spent. This prevents education money is spent on expensive hobbies
directors and managers, such as gleaming buildings, official cars and junkets in
instead of education for our children.
Art subsidies, we stop with that. Our beautiful Dutch language we defend.
So the government communicates only in Dutch. Afrikaans is closely related
with Dutch. The language spoken in South Africa and Namibia, is increasingly
marginalized. Netherlands stands up for the Afrikaans and its speakers, for example through
embassies and the Dutch Language Union.
We are witnessing in beautiful local traditions: the lapwing search in Friesland,
carnival in Limburg etc. The Frisian language retains its place in public life.
We cut down a lot on the state broadcaster. Which does many things very well
commercial stations can be done. Netherlands 1 often resembles a commercial
transmitter. The state broadcaster is too much to the left.
Dutch are fond of animals. The PVV is too. The Freedom Party was the
driving force behind the Animal Police. Five hundred policemen who were committed
for animal welfare. In its short existence the animal cops were a huge success. The harvest
not only included people who mistreat animals, but also other things on their
slate had, like domestic violence.
The PVV wants 500 man full of animals and police running abolish them by
Kunduz coalition back.
Also, the Freedom Party in favor of heavy prison sentences for animal abusers. A
lifelong ban on keeping animals for abusers is also needed.
The ritual slaughter must be banned by law. The PVV will draft legislation to that end
also extend further support in the future.
Factory farming is what the PVV concerned had its day. Consumers will
hopefully ensure that this rapidly thing of the past.

‚Ä¢ Approach and criminalization of illegal animal over the internet

And especially:
Protect our fishermen against bizarre EU rules. Make way for Urk,
Volendam, Yerseke and Scheveningen!
45

Our abroad
The past two years have left many media keys in the 'Arab Spring'
sung. The theory was that all Muslims would now sit on Facebook and they
therefore went forget jihad. In reality, the 'Spring' a harsh winter. Here and
there disappeared a dictator - to be replaced by an even more Islamic regime.
Sharia gaining ground so rapidly. The progressive opinion- bigwigs mistook their pink dreams
again with reality.
The jihadist coups underline once more the permanent danger of
Islam. This totalitarian ideology requires its followers perpetual war, until
when the whole world is Islamic. So it is not surprising that Islam is a
is constant source of unrest. The Party for Freedom finds even internationally
area Islamization must be stopped.

46

PVV election 2012 - 2017 | Their Brussels, our Netherlands

Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East deserves our enthusiastic support. Certainly
Now the country is increasingly threatened by the crazy mullahs in Iran.
For the Freedom Party, the Jewish state is always a beacon of hope, progress
and Western civilization. All stages should the cheap Israel-bashing
Combined forces are countered by Islam and links.
Jordan is Palestine. It is up to Israel to define what it does to the heart of her
country: Judea and Samaria. The Dutch government is its politically correct opposition
building more towns and villages in Judea and Samaria immediately cease and correct
give political support. Netherlands also moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to the
capital Jerusalem.
The diplomatic relations between the Netherlands and countries of the Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC) to be minimized as long as they stick to them
signed Cairo Declaration which human rights are limited to the
barbaric sharia. These countries should be put out of the United Nations. As long as this
not realized Netherlands pay a cent to the United Nations.
Development there we naturally stop as soon as possible. Many countries in
the grant infusion of Sinterklaas Ben Knapen hang corrupt. And never has been proven
that money to throw a country has a beneficial effect. We believe in free trade. Their
products are welcome in our stores. Trade barriers with third world countries
lifted.
We say goodbye to the West Indies. Now in the Kingdom, but if the PVV
lies, all six islands are quickly abroad. We award the islands complete
sovereignty, the sooner the better. Islands with a corrupt government like Cura√ßao
received with immediate effect no longer cent in the Netherlands.
The JSF is not purchased. The number of F-16s is reduced. In our defense policy
the Dutch state interests first. On 'Peacekeeping' we do for half the
, and only if there is a demonstrable Dutch interest. By recalibrating
tasks can also save money on defense. Crucial commercial interests
our country. For example, are currently seriously threatened by the rise of the
jihad pirates around the Gulf of Aden. The Royal Navy is enabled here
make short shrift. NATO remains the cornerstone of our defense.

47

PVV election 2012 - 2017 | Their Brussels, our Netherlands



And therefore....
Abroad:
‚Ä¢ Foreign policy at the service of Dutch interest
‚Ä¢ Human rights policy gets the attention it deserves
‚Ä¢ OIC states (in the Cairo Declaration) that human rights are subject to
Sharia. Therefore: OIC countries away from the United Nations
‚Ä¢ As long as they are members of the United Nations: Netherlands does not pay to the UN
‚Ä¢ Increased collaboration with Flanders
Middle East:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

No recognition Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus
Jordan Palestine =
Not a cent subsidy for the anti-Israel hate industry
Political support for the construction of Jewish towns in Judea and Samaria
"Palestinians" are no longer refugees. Lifting UNWRA
Dutch embassy to Jerusalem

Human rights:
‚Ä¢ Support to endangered minorities such as the Copts in Egypt and the Armenians
Turkey.
Development:
‚Ä¢	Not. (Only emergency relief)
Defense:
‚Ä¢ No JSF
‚Ä¢ Protection of Dutch commercial interests center
‚Ä¢ NATO is crucial

And especially:
No EU army, no armed missions under the EU flag, no common EUbuitenlandbeleid

49

Our environment
Well.
Kunduz let milieugekkies again bathe in the grant. Is there somewhere in
Netherlands to find where no wind condition? Watch out, because thanks to the VVD
there is also soon to be such susbsidiemolen. That seems to provide 'green
jobs'. But the only jobs it brings its highly-paid gigs for
Green Link Sers and D66 voters who do not find work elsewhere.
To make things worse Kunduz abolishes the untaxed travel allowance. Our
drivers should be 'greened'. The idea is that they're no longer in the car
sit, but are moving. The reality is that a lot of hard working people hard
be hit in their pockets.
50

PVV election 2012 - 2017 | Their Brussels, our Netherlands

Sustainability is another word for expensive.
The Freedom Party is naturally in favor of the cleanest possible
habitat. We should not go back to the sixties when plenty Netherlands
air pollution and knew the inland water was filthy.
Transport by car or public transport, which make people myself out. There is no
guidance from the government for that. The car is not a cash cow, so the unloaded
travel expenses we reinstate. No commuter tax!
Good infrastructure is vital to a healthy economy. The Party for the
Freedom is therefore delighted with every meter asphalt is applied. We do not cut corners on
the construction of new roads. Of course, should as far as possible obstacles to speed
to be eliminated on the road. On motorways is 140 kilometers per hour
beautiful maximum speed. The 80-kilometer zones to be crazy. Stop there
we along.
The price of petrol should go down and you can. The PVV gives Cook of the penny finally
back to citizens. The petrol and diesel duty we decrease by twelve cents. Also the
excise duty on LPG is six cents down.
Our main ports of Schiphol and Rotterdam port must belong to the world.
So no European rules that hamper growth. The accessibility of the port of
Rotterdam improve is crucial to our economy.
In recent years, the housing associations loose from their foundations. Vestia,
Woonbron, Rochdale his now infamous names. They proved good at banking,
speculate, the purchase of cruise ships and buying Maseratis. The
housing associations should get back to where they were established: leasing
good homes. We delete all additional rent increases above inflation.
It is often said wind turbines do not run on wind, but on subsidies. However, the go
government but by placing those monstrosities in our beautiful Dutch
landscape. For example, in Groningen in the N33, in the Drenthe Peat Colony on beautiful
places in Friesland, near Urk. Everywhere they are about to whiz. They ruin the landscape,
slaughter the birds and also cost another fortune. The Freedom Party says:
stop with those useless leftist hobby.
Brussels is increasingly determine what we do with our nature. Who in Gelderland
terrace wants to expand will be faced with our European friends to determine if it can
(usually it can not). The PVV is for nature. The more the better. But who better
whether nature is in danger: we or Brussels? Exactly!

51

PVV election 2012 - 2017 | Their Brussels, our Netherlands



And therefore....
Mobility:
‚Ä¢ No road pricing, no commuter tax
‚Ä¢ Continue! Quitting the 80-kilometer
‚Ä¢ 140 kilometers per hour where it can
