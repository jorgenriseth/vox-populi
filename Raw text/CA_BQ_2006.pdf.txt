Message from the Leader of the Bloc Québécois
Dear voters, dear voters,
The June 28, 2004, the Applicants Bloc Québécois soliciting your support. The
Quebecers then we have reiterated their confidence in large numbers, which allowed our party to win a fourth consecutive majority of seats
Quebec. This trust honors us and shows that here in Quebec, the Bloc Québécois defends
best interests.
Boosted, elected Bloc Québécois worked very hard to advance Quebec. As
we committed to do, the Bloc Québécois has always acted responsibly and
constructive, with the sole criterion in the interests of Quebec.
We have demonstrated our commitment to advancing the issues like the imbalance
Tax and financing of post-secondary education, Kyoto and urgency to reduce
pollution and a host of other critical issues.
To achieve progress on these and all the others, we must first of all we
ensure that the government is clean and respects the rules of democracy.
The Liberal government of Paul Martin has done the opposite. He has lost all authority
moral to govern. Justice Gomery has indeed demonstrated that the Liberal Party of Paul Martin
steeped in corruption.
The demonstration has now been made that the Liberal Party of Canada wanted to buy elections
1997 and 2000 with the sponsorship money and has violated the most elementary rules
Democracy, including at the time of the 1995 referendum.
The Liberal government has shown contempt toward Quebec by attempting to buy
awareness of Quebecers with our own money.
Paul Martin says he knew nothing of all this. How believe, when he was the Minister
Finance which provided money, he was the Vice President of the Treasury Board responsible for making
respect the rules and it was number two in the government?
How to believe Paul Martin, while he himself was involved in the award of more than doubtful
federal contracts, it did adopt regulations and legislative amendments that allowed
his family business to benefit from tax havens?
How to believe that Paul Martin swore at every opportunity that the culture that led to
Sponsorship would be banished from Ottawa and the Liberal Party, then he betrayed that promise by appointing friends and Liberal organizers as Francis Fox and Dennis Dawson in the Senate - is
cronyism.

For sovereignty, fortunately here, the Bloc Québécois
The Bloc Québécois has accomplished much in a short time, but there is still
a lot to do. So we decided to update the electoral platform of 2004
specifying the context and integrating new challenges there.
As was the case in 2004, this platform offers Quebecers of
prospects beyond the scope of Canadian federalism. These perspectives are those
Quebec sovereign and more of them are directly inspired by the work done
elected officials as well as activists and activists of the Bloc Québécois during the congress
our party which was held last October.
Although federal elections are neither the place nor the time to decide the future of Quebec,
it seemed important to us to present the public with a portrait of Quebec
sovereign. For it is also the role of the Bloc Québécois to think about what will be the country
Quebec, particularly in the fields within this time the federal government.
You will therefore be able to compare the means which are those with the current Quebec
will have capacity of a sovereign Quebec.
The Bloc Québécois will continue to defend and promote tirelessly, with integrity and in a manner
responsible for Quebec's interests in Ottawa. At the same time, we will intensify our efforts
to make Quebec a sovereign country.
In the coming years, the people of Quebec will have the chance to change profoundly
and sustainably the course of its history. To support Quebecers on
this road, fortunately, here is the Bloc.

CHAPTER 1 - DEMOCRACY
A strong and effective democracy
Democratic values ​​of Quebecers have deep roots in
history. Québec parliamentary democracy dates back to 1792 and the Parliament of Lower Canada. Some episodes of this story show that democratic values
Quebec are solidly anchored long time. For example, in 1807, a member of the
Jewish community was elected for the first time in Canada1. For their part, the Patriots will
push for greater freedom and democracy. Closer to home, the 1995 referendum on the
Sovereignty has demonstrated the high quality of Quebec democracy with a record turnout and debates just as animated as peaceful.
Democracy is a fundamental value of political action of the Bloc Québécois.

The Quebec National Assembly
The National Assembly is the privileged place of Quebec democracy. This is the only Parliament
controlled by the Québec people and authorized to speak on its behalf. In the National Assembly, the
Quebec nation is sovereign.
However, the National Assembly still year after year loses some of its grip over
on laws and taxes, while the absence of Quebec in international forums is felt more as international agreements govern our lives. Quebec democracy is thus weakened by the Canadian federal framework.

Democratic deficits
Democratic deficits in Quebec are particularly important as they are numerous. This
is not surprising to see the disaffection of Quebecers with respect to the process
policy when we know how much his ability to guide decisions is declining. Currently,
the Quebecers:
• vote to elect representatives to the National Assembly so that they decide
health guidance, education or for the family, but the federal government
refuses to take account of decisions taken unanimously by the parliament controlled only
by the people of Quebec;
• vote to elect representatives to the National Assembly, but they are powerless to implement the policies for which they were elected, since they are
deprived of adequate financial resources by the fiscal imbalance imposed by Ottawa;
• vote to elect representatives to the National Assembly, but Canada refuses to
Quebec can participate in international forums where decisions are made in
areas that concern it.

Liberal undemocratic practices
Since the Gomery tabled his report on the sponsorship scandal,
we know that the Liberal Party of Canada has violated the rules of democracy by diverting
public money - our money - in favor of his election fund. The Liberals have created a
bribes system. According Gomery, the Liberal Party of Canada is disgraced and
has "betrayed" the trust of the 2 population as a system of government.
By transgressing the rules in the 1995 referendum, using $ 5.4 million from
the sponsorship program to finance the 1997 elections of 2000 and 2004 and
knowingly failing to report to the Chief Electoral tens of thousands of
dollars in cash given to "volunteers" and candidates, the Liberal Party government
Canada has seriously damaged the federal democratic system.
By transgressing the rules in the 1995 referendum and trying to buy the election
1997, 2000 and 2004, the government of the Liberal Party of Canada has dug a fourth
democratic deficit.
These democratic deficits are dangerous for Quebec. The challenges facing the
Quebecers can only be overcome and turned into opportunities without progress
a general mobilization of society. To do this, Quebec democracy must be strong
and effective. Only Quebec's accession to sovereignty will allow Quebec and
Quebecers to decide themselves democratically their future.
We must therefore pave the way for the sovereignty and attack us now to these democratic deficits to allow the Quebec people to regain some control on
decisions that will determine its future. It starts with respect, for Ottawa, decisions
taken unanimously by the National Assembly of Quebec and the laws of Quebec and
Canada.

1.1 Find the power to act
The National Assembly flouted by Ottawa
We can never say it enough: the National Assembly is the only parliament controlled by the people
Quebec. When his MPs a unanimous position on a particular issue,
this means that the Quebec people are united. In a normal democracy, that is enough to take
a decision and implement it quickly. This is not the case in Quebec.
In recent years, the National Assembly was unanimous in demanding the establishment of a
Quebec parental leave program, denouncing the fiscal imbalance or the new law
Young Offenders, for Quebec to demand a greater role in forums
International, to call for a fair deal for Kyoto implementation or to
denounce the federal government's intrusion into the exclusive jurisdiction
Quebec. The parties in the National Assembly are equally unanimous in refusing to
sign the constitution or reject the Clarity Act. Yet in all these cases, the government
Federal has refused to heed the unanimous opinion of the National Assembly.

The federal contempt
One of the most blatant examples of disregard for the Martin government toward Quebec,
this is the so-called issue of "national interest. "
As stated Paul Martin: "We must recognize that there are national issues that need
influence things in the areas of provinces. Cohesion is a federal responsibility. "
Five days later, in response to a question from the Bloc Québécois leader on service
guard, he added: "Is the member saying that our children are not of interest
National? They are. "
This theory, besides being unconstitutional, is dangerous. If all that is
Federal becomes important under the theory of "national interest" Quebec will no longer
responsible to administer the decisions made in Ottawa.
In the case of parental leave, it took ten years and a continuation of the Quebec government to court so that Quebec can finally implement the unanimous decision
of the National Assembly. Note that in a sovereign Quebec, such a program exist
already for many years.
This is a serious democratic deficit that may discourage citizens
Quebec, because their vote is constantly flouted by Ottawa. The only way for the people
Quebec to fully regain its democratic capacity is to ensure that
the National Assembly is sovereign. Nobody dictates to the Canadian people what to do
with taxes or laws. Canada is a sovereign country and when the House of
Commons is unanimous, all is said. Why should it be any different for the people of Quebec?

The Bloc Québécois
In Ottawa, the Bloc has become a bulwark to protect Quebec democracy against liberal attacks. Indeed, while Quebec has adopted, there are more than 25 years,
a law on the financing of political parties banning corporate contributions, while
Quebec has developed referendum and electoral laws limiting party spending, the
Liberal government has continued to despise democracy in Quebec:
• bypass the Quebec law on popular consultations using Option
Canada as a front to spend $ 4.8 million to the NO side;
• creation of the sponsorship program in an attempt to buy the sympathy
Quebecers while bailing out the coffers of the Liberal Party of Canada;
• adoption of the Clarity Act, an act which aims to remove the Quebeckers
Quebecers the right to democratically decide their future.
The Bloc Québécois stood up against these attacks by working to uncover the system
bribes from the Liberal party, denouncing the dirty money envelopes circulating in Liberal
Canada, demanding the establishment of the Gomery Commission, demanding that the Auditor General investigate Option Canada and proposing legislative and administrative solutions to better control the excesses in Ottawa.
The Bloc Québécois is committed to ensuring scrupulously and respect for democratic rules
by the federal government.
The only way for Quebecers to regain some of their power
Ottawa to act is to strengthen the presence there of the Bloc Québécois, the only party in Ottawa that defends
the unanimous decision of the National Assembly. Over the Bloc Québécois members are
, the more the House of Commons must take into account the opinion of Quebec.
The last federal election, which allowed the election of 54 members of the Bloc Quebecois,
demonstrated eloquently. On issues such as the agreements on health, on
parental leave and child care, or the rejection of the US missile shield and the abandonment of the enlargement of the Seaway project of the St. Lawrence, the government was obliged to take account of the massive presence of MPs Bloc Québécois.
This time again, the Bloc Québécois will not participate in a coalition government as it
require him to renounce fully defend the interests of Quebec. However, in the past,
the Bloc Québécois did not hesitate to make temporary alliances with other
Ottawa political parties when in the best interests of Quebec, such as the
about the fiscal imbalance.
The Bloc Québécois agrees to make temporary alliances with other teams
policies in Ottawa to advance the interests of Quebec and defend decisions

1.2 The financial strangulation of Quebec
For Quebec democracy is alive and active, it is not enough to elect representatives to the National Assembly. It also requires that these elected representatives be able to
implement democratic decisions. To achieve this, they need resources
Financial.
However, the fiscal imbalance parity deprives the Quebec government of its ability to
implement its choice. Half of the taxes Quebecers is controlled by a
government that refuses to recognize the Quebec nation. The federal government uses
these taxes for multiplying intrusions, weaken the Quebec government and impose the choice of Canada.
It can not be a living and active democracy in these conditions.

Money in Ottawa, the needs in Quebec
Since 1994, Ottawa harvest more and more taxes and taxes in Quebec, but reverts
less the money where it is needed. This means that the federal government is
less its share to fund social programs while revenue
increasing.
The consequences of the fiscal imbalance
The Léonard3 Committee, created by the leader of the Bloc Québécois to review federal programs, has
demonstrated that the fiscal imbalance has three fundamental consequences for Québec:
• the federal government is too rich compared to its responsibilities. Which means that
the taxes of Quebecers are not used to meet their
priorities. Thus, the federal government has used a portion of those taxes to multiply
bureaucratic costs, waste and corruption, while the government
Quebec's lack of resources to fund health, education, family policy and
economic development;
• the federal government take its surplus resources and strangulation
Quebec tax for multiplying intrusions. This approach requires decisions
taken by Canada in areas where it is the Quebec people who should decide;
• while the Canadian state is strengthened and repay its debt, the Quebec government
weakens and borrows more from year to year.

Bureaucratic spending out of control
Component I of the Leonardo report showed beyond doubt that Ottawa has too much money
compared to its responsibilities. This situation forces the federal government to spend without
counting in its bureaucracy and wasting our taxes. From 1998 to 2003, spending
operation increased by 39% and the number of federal employees rose
46,000, while Ottawa provides virtually no health service and education.
The Committee made a preliminary update of its report covering the past two years.
What he discovered is staggering:

• 2003 to 2005, operating expenses increased by 20.4%;
• 1998 to 2005, operating expenses increased 67%, a
increase of $ 20.6 billion in seven years.
This ensures that the money of Quebecers will bureaucratic federal spending rather than health or education, which runs completely
against their priorities.
The Bloc Québécois demands that the federal government reduce its bureaucratic expenses
to release, in a horizon of three years, an additional margin of maneuver
$ 5.7 billion annually for Quebec and the provinces.

Ottawa's intrusions in Quebec
At the signing of the Act of the British North America in 1867, it was agreed
divide the powers of each government. But the federal government has never respected
this pact and has increased year after year, intrusions in the fields of competence
Reserved Quebec. This ensures that decisions on health, education,
culture or family, who are supposed to be taken by the people of Quebec to the Assembly
National, are now determined in part by Ottawa. The size and number of these intrusions have been rising steadily for a century and the phenomenon is further amplified in
the past five years. The following table shows the proportion of expenses Ottawa
constitute intrusions in a century.

Since Paul Martin became Prime Minister, federal intrusions have multiplied
at an alarming rate in all fields: municipalities, welfare, education, health, small
childhood, to name a few.
At the same time the Liberal government of Paul Martin multiplied intrusions, bankruptcy
in the areas of its jurisdiction is pitiful. For example, fisheries management is an
disaster, EI remains inaccessible to the greatest number of workers,
Firearms Registry was a bottomless pit, the timber file is
remains unresolved and management of operating expenses Ottawa is out of control.

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

Restoring Balance: eliminate the fiscal imbalance
This trend is unhealthy because, as the federal government is strengthened financially, it weakens Quebec and the opportunity to multiply intrusions. The Quebec people is
then stripped of its ability to make choices. Increasingly, decisions are taken
Ottawa. This trend must be reversed.
Quebec is not alone in denouncing the fiscal imbalance. Premiers
Provinces also denounce this situation and convinced the Bloc Québécois parties
Opposition in the House of Commons to vote for a motion that recognizes
the fiscal imbalance and that requires disposal. Only the Liberal Party of Canada refused
recognize the existence of the fiscal imbalance, while it was Paul Martin himself who created it
problem.
On October 7, 2004, the Bloc Québécois forced the federal Liberals to recognize the
Speech from the Throne that the financial pressures mentioned are synonymous with Paul Martin
fiscal imbalance. A few weeks later, the adoption by the House of Commons a
Bloc Québécois motion allowed the creation of the Finance Subcommittee to study on
a Canadian base the fiscal imbalance and propose concrete solutions
to eliminate it. The four main findings of the report:
• Register the fiscal imbalance in the agenda of the Standing Committee work
Finance in order to monitor on a triennial basis, as mandates
Regular Committee in various fields and, in collaboration with the Council of
federation;
• the federal government should limit the piecemeal agreements or specific agreements with
the provinces that are exacerbating the horizontal fiscal imbalance;
• restructure the CHST on social programs in two transfers
separate federal: postsecondary education, on the one hand, and social assistance and
social services, on the other;
• Once this is done restructuring, the Subcommittee believes that each transfer
be enhanced over a period of four years, as is the case for federal transfers
about health.
Additionally, March 8, 2005, the Quebec National Assembly unanimously adopted a motion
reaffirming the existence of the fiscal imbalance and reiterating its demand that the federal government
recognizes and corrects this fiscal imbalance and inequity of the new equalization calculation.
Note also that in June 2002 the National Assembly unanimously passed a resolution that
endorsed the recommendations of the Séguin commission and that less than two years later,
March 17, 2004, the National Assembly unanimously reiterated its desire to see the government
Federal recognize the fiscal imbalance.

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

So before this almost unanimously recognized imbalance, the Bloc Québécois takes up
account the proposals made by the Commission on Fiscal Imbalance. This approach
in two aims first of all to deal with the most pressing by increasing transfers for
education and social programs.
The Bloc Québécois is asking the federal government to use its leeway
financial to increase transfers for postsecondary education (college sectors
university) and social programs of $ 11.6 billion over the next three
years.
It is urgent to change the equalization formula so that this mechanism can play
its role in redistribution of wealth across Canada, which is clearly
not the case at present. From 1994-1995 to 2004-2005, the proportion of federal revenues
devoted to equalization has dropped 23%, from 7% to 5.4%.

Canada Paul Martin
Note that the multiplication of specific agreements, made possible by Paul Martin instead made
ensure that equalization now increasing fiscal disparities between Quebec and
provinces rather than smooth out, as evidenced by the following table.

The Bloc Québécois is asking the federal government to amend the equalization formula
based on the "rule of ten" 5 and modifying the calculation of the richness foncière6 so
that this mechanism plays its role of redistributing wealth across
Canadian.

4 This is the CHST and equalization.
5 Currently, the amount of equalization is calculated from a basket of indicators from five Canadian provinces.
The "rule of ten" means that the calculation is based on the indicators of the ten Canadian provinces.
6 In the 2004 budget, Ottawa has modified the calculation of property value, but these changes are so gradual that only
50% of the transition will be effective in 2009.

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

Ultimately, however, the real solution lies in the restoration of fiscal balance
federal government, Quebec and the provinces. This is why the Commission on Fiscal Imbalance recommended a new division of taxation fields, in addition to the bonus equalization. Quebec and the provinces will benefit from a source of
stable and independent income that would replace the Canada Health Transfer and programs
social (CHST) 7. The Bloc Québécois agrees with this recommendation.
The Bloc Québécois supports the recommendation of the Commission on Fiscal Imbalance
to the effect that the sharing of tax room should be renegotiated between the government
Federal, provincial and the Quebec government.
By improving the financial position of the Government of Quebec, the Quebec people find
gradually its power to act and will be able to concretely improve his lot. It
will upgrade Quebec democracy.
The Bloc Québécois believes that this will give confidence to Quebecers and they
the taste will go further and take back full control of their own financial resources by making access to the status of Quebec sovereign country.
If the financial position of the Quebec government is currently precarious, it is far from
the case of Quebec's economic health. The collective wealth of Quebec and
Quebec is indeed an enviable standard internationally. With GDP per
capita of $ 26,502 in 20048, the Quebec nation ahead of Italy and Germany.
Furthermore, the Quebec economy is performing, as indicated growth per
capita which surpassed that of Ontario six times since 1998. The financial resources of
Quebec are therefore very important and the precarious health of Quebec's public finances is
essentially made the fiscal imbalance. This problem will be solved with sovereignty
Quebec.

Financial transparency
Governments have a duty to manage public funds and take their decisions in full
transparency. It is essential for the proper functioning of democracy. There
Transparency is also the best way to have informed discussions on public issues
and enable Parliament to control government spending. In this regard, the
Liberal Party government of Canada was particularly poor.

7 Since 1 April 2004, the CHST was split into two separate transfers: the CHT (Canada Health Transfer)
and CST (CHST on social programs).

The financial masquerade of the Liberal government of Paul Martin
Since 1994, the Liberal government has consistently misled the public about its margin
financial flexibility. This grotesque farce amounts to nothing less than a form of fraud
Intellectual and prevents any serious debate on budgetary choices of the government, which is
contrary to the common good. It is time to end this charade and inform the public about the real state of federal public finances.
In 2004-2005, the federal government has used creative accounting practices
to reduce its surplus. He attributed to fiscal year 2004-2005 more expenses
should have been spread over several years. The federal government has acted this way
just to hide the extent of its surpluses and to continue to deny the existence of the fiscal imbalance. It is therefore surplus of $ 12 billion, not $ 1.6 billion that the federal government should have announced for 2004-2005.
The federal government tried to hide until the last minute, the surplus it has.
It was only at the 2005 Update, unveiled on the eve of this campaign
election, the federal government has spread its billions of dollars in an attempt to buy
the vote of the citizens by tax cuts funded from the money he
perceived too.
The actions of the Bloc Québécois have allowed the commitment of four independent forecasters
which, since January 2005, present financial forecasts to the Finance Committee. But he
must go further and support the creation of an independent office and permanent forecast
Financial, similar to what has existed for many years in the United States.

1.3 The absence of international forums Québec
Quebec is very open to the world. His successes on the international stage are
many both in economic, cultural, scientific and sports. Quebec
sovereign Quebec can count on a foreign policy, implemented by a device
Diplomatic service values ​​and interests of Quebec.
The adoption by UNESCO of the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions gives us a taste of sovereign Quebec's contribution to the international community. Quebec has indeed been at the origin of this convention and was very active until the
fin9. This shows that when Quebec and Canada agree, they are stronger two
only one voice. And when a sovereign Quebec and Canada will disagree on an issue, they can talk about their own voice on the international scene. Quebec sovereignty
appears as a way of rewarding future for all.
For now, the government of Quebec is excluded from international forums where
discussed issues that affect them directly, such as culture, health, education,
labor and agriculture and the environment. The governments of Quebec who succeeded
since the sixties were all required to be represented in these occasions.
One must admit, however, that as long as Quebec is not a sovereign country, it will
very difficult to get such a thing for two reasons:
• the federal government has refused to grant such status to Quebec within
international forums, with the exception of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie;
• international organizations under the aegis of the United Nations do not provide for such status
sovereign countries. At most she UNESCO provides an associate membership for
certain territories, but the request must be made by the country that is responsible for their
foreign policy, or, in the case of Quebec, Canada.

Paul Martin betrays his promise
During the last federal election, Paul Martin promised this: "Quebec is not
just sitting with us at the UNESCO table, but it must be able to take
word when we discuss, for example, cultural diversity. [...] It must be able to speak on
the major issues affecting closely. The door must be wide open to him unequivocally
and I promise you it will be. "10
But Pierre Pettigrew said: "I have no choice. I must ensure that I will not make any precedents with which we will have to say "you can not go back to that," even when we go
have a fanatic Quebec independence the government eventually. "11 Thus,
Paul Martin has broken his promise, as Mr. Pettigrew then spoke on behalf of the government.
9 It has been, because Quebec took full advantage of one of the few seats it has in international organizations:
the World Organization of the Francophonie.

A change in federal government will change nothing. There is unanimity among federalist parties in Quebec to deny any role on the international stage. When the Bloc
Quebecois proposed a bill recognizing Quebec has full responsibility
fields of competence that the Constitution grants him, including internationally,
all federalist, Liberal and NDP as preservatives, are there
opposed. The Bloc Québécois is the only support the Gérin-Lajoie doctrine
Ottawa12.

Democratize foreign policy
When Quebec becomes a sovereign country, it will be able to democratize its political
foreign. More specifically, in a sovereign Quebec:
• international treaties will be submitted for approval to the National Assembly
and in some very important cases, they will be subject to a referendum;
• Quebec while sending troops abroad will be subject to the approval of
the National Assembly;
• under the Quebec consultation model, permanent roundtables
Civil society will be created to discuss issues of foreign affairs,
security and international development;
• the Québec government will create an observatory of globalization and generate
creating an international network of observatories that could, with the experience
gained by different countries, allow Quebec to better respond to the challenges
it faces.

Vote on international agreements
In recent years, the Bloc Québécois has been the spokesman of those in Ottawa
consider that the elected representatives of the people should have the opportunity to rule on international agreements concluded by the federal government on their behalf. This
opportunity is particularly important for the people of Quebec that is represented by a
government that refuses to recognize it. The Bloc Quebecois has already submitted bills
this direction in the past.
Democracy loses much of its meaning if the elected representatives of citizens and
citizens are excluded from all the international component of the decisions taken by the government
Federal, while it has more and more impact on the everyday life of the population.
As it promised in the last election, the Bloc Québécois presented a
Bill to democratize the whole process of concluding international treaties. He
proposed that the House of Commons consult civil society before deciding on
treaties, vote it important treaties before the government may ratify them and the
Government consults Quebec and the provinces before going to negotiate a treaty that affects their
jurisdiction. Unfortunately, all the federalist members opposed it.
12 The doctrine Gérin-Lajoie wants Quebec itself exerts its jurisdiction everywhere, including in the international arena.
All political parties in the National Assembly and all the governments of Quebec for 40 years subscribe to it.

Similarly, parliamentarians should have the right to debate in the House of Commons
trade agreements and treaties are being negotiated before a vote is
held.
The Bloc Québécois will require a debate in progress on international agreements
negotiation before the ratification of such agreements.

Represent Quebec with the diplomatic corps
The Bloc Québécois holds meetings several times a year with the diplomatic corps
This in Ottawa and elsewhere in Quebec. These meetings usually
much success, fifty countries are being represented on average each time.
These meetings are important to argue the point of view of Quebec, often very different
of the image which is presented by Ottawa.
Similarly, MPs of the Bloc Québécois take every foreign delegation
to weave a network of international contacts they keep informed of the situation
Quebec.
The Bloc Québécois will continue to organize regular meetings with the diplomatic corps
and with its network of international contacts to present the views of Quebec on
important issues.

1.4 Paving the democratic path now
Sovereignty will be a golden opportunity for Quebecers to overcome
challenge the democratic deficit by making Quebec a country where citizens have
a real influence on decisions that affect their own future. Only in this way,
Quebec can meet the challenges it faces and turn them into opportunities
advancing Quebec as ever.
The only way for Quebec to fully regain its power to act is to resume
control its taxes, its laws and its international relations. Only this
so that Quebecers can fully use their capacity to decide
their future.
When Quebecers will vote to elect their representatives to the Assembly
national, it is they who will represent them on the international stage. International agreements can be discussed in the Quebec Parliament. In addition, when representatives
elected by the population of Quebec will make decisions, they will have all the tools in hand,
including the financial means to implement them without having to beg another nation
to grant the privilege.
To enable Québec democracy to move forward rather than retreat, the Bloc Québécois
agrees to :
• enter into temporary alliances with the government in place or with others
political parties in Ottawa in order to advance the interests of Quebec and
defend the unanimous decisions of the National Assembly;
• fight the fiscal imbalance between the federal government and the government of
Québec to ensure adequate funding for the democratic and collective choices
Quebecers;
• allow Quebec to better defend and promote its interests on the stage
International while allowing it to gain valuable expertise in
International;
• require for parliamentarians the right to decide with a vote on any agreement
international importance held by the federal government;
• to Ottawa so that the household tax Quebecers
no longer serve to break the democratic rules and feed corruption.

1.5 Eliminating Liberal corruption
The Liberals were predictable skids
The first condition for sustainable development of a society is a responsible government that manages with efficiency and honesty taxes, laws and international relations
on behalf of citizens. The criterion that should govern the decisions taken by a Government
that of the common good. The Liberal government of Paul Martin fails this test on the line.
In its 2000 election platform, the Bloc Quebecois had already identified the main
players in the sponsorship scandal. He demanded an independent public inquiry, the
appointment of an independent ethics commissioner and the end of patronage. Paul Martin and
Liberal government have refused to acquiesce to these requests until they were
forced to do so.
Yet the list of breaches of good governance and ethics of the Liberal government
is very very long. Include promises disowned the three red books forecasts
truncated budget, the institutionalized looting of the employment insurance fund, promotion
tax havens, mismanagement of public finances, creating imbalance
Tax, propaganda campaigns against Quebec sovereignists from funds
public, patronage out of the Canada Fund for employment.13 creation or surveys
the public for partisan, patronage appointments at all levels of the State
Canadian and impunity of virtually all those responsible for these malpractices.
The last failure to date, the sponsorship scandal that revealed cases of fraud,
patronage and corruption of the Liberal Party of Canada, was the drop broke the making
well filled vase liberal forfeitures. The Bloc Québécois can boast denounced
consistency all the abuses of the Liberal government since 1994, starting with money paid
in defiance of all rules Option Canada in 1995 in a referendum on sovereignty.
The Bloc Québécois will continue to monitor the use made of public funds in Ottawa
and denounce all cases of patronage, embezzlement, influence peddling,
conflict of interest and fraud.

Canadian propaganda and sponsorships
Following the 1995 referendum, all members of the federal cabinet, including current Prime
Minister, approved an action plan to strengthen the federal government's visibility and
the Liberal Party in Quebec. This working meeting was born a series of projects serving
sales force Canada to Quebecers: the Office of "information" of Canada, strengthening the support to Canadian Unity Council and the sponsorship program. These measures
being financed by a "reserve for national unity" secret and discretionary release for
provision of Jean Chrétien by Paul Martin. Justice Gomery argued that the Treasury Board,
sat where Paul Martin, "almost always gave her carte blanche to use the
13 The transitional jobs fund of which had changed its name, presumably to try to forget the scandal. The fund has completely
been eliminated since.

21

Unity Reserve because the presentations that were specifically addressed to him
endorsed by the Prime Minister. "14
This fund was hidden and camouflaged in Parliament so it appears neither in the Accounts
public nor in the budget documents. This reserve was so secret and embarrassing that,
when it was brought to light by the Bloc Québécois, the government was quick to
eliminate it. We later learned that the federal government had launched a real
covert offensive that transgressed the financial control rules, in addition to violating laws.

The sponsorship scandal
The Ministry of Public Works has provided approximately $ 40 million annually to events
cultural and community, primarily in Quebec in order to increase the visibility of
federal government. In return for sponsorship, organizations had to accept
provide visibility to the government using the word "Canada" wordmark and other symbols such as the Canadian flag at their events and their promotional items.
In November 2005, the Commissioner Gomery found that: "In 1994-2003, the government
Canada will have spent a total of $ 332 million for special programs and sponsorships,
of which 44.4 percent. 100, or $ 147 million in fees and commissions paid to agencies
communication and advertising. "15
Commissioner Gomery had a problem and confirm that the Bloc Québécois had identified
in 2000. Moreover, on page 40 of its 2000 election platform, the Bloc Québécois
denounced cronyism surrounding the sponsorship regime. In 2000, the Bloc had identified
main companies involved in this scandal: Groupe Everest, Groupaction, Lafleur
Communication and Polygon, to name a few.
The Gomery Commission also helped to uncover "a well-oiled system of bribes'
where Sponsorship Program funds were diverted to the benefit of the Liberal Party
Canada has three electoral campaigns of "dirty money" in the words
the Minister of Transport and Political Lieutenant of the Liberal Party of Canada in Quebec, Jean
Stone.
The Bloc Québécois, which has actively participated in the work of the Gomery commission to
ensure that the truth be known, estimated in the light of the evidence heard, at least
$ 5.4 million made their way to the Liberal Party of Canada. The Bloc Québécois believes that
all these are to be delivered to the state.

The Gomery report is damning for the Liberal Party of Canada
Paul Martin is trying to dissociate itself from the Liberal scandal since the report of the Auditor General.
He would like that we forget that he is a member of caucus PLC since 1988 and has tried to
elected leader of the party twice.

But the party of which he is the chief was sentenced by the Commissioner Gomery. The Commissioner says
The Liberal party has "betrayed" 16 people, and at all levels:
• the office of Prime Minister was exercising political leadership of a "program almost
secret of discretionary spending for beneficiaries sorted on the shutter [...] "17;
• CEOs and prominent organizers of the Liberal party "have
dishonored and disgraced the party, "accepting" of cash contributions
other dishonest advantage. "18 Commissioner Gomery confirmed that these leaders
Liberal Party have "acted contrary to the laws";
• "a well-oiled system of bribes" 19 developed by Jacques Corriveau, a friend
Staff Jean Chrétien held various elected positions within the PLC
Over the years, has allowed "the delivery of cash payments to executives
LPCQ "20;
• quoting Jean Chrétien, the Commissioner said that the Cabinet sitting where Paul Martin
"Unanimous in its determination to do all that was necessary for the conditions
winning of sovereignty are never met in Quebec. "21
More worryingly, the Commissioner tells us that in the vice-presidency of Paul Martin
Treasury Board, government watchdog has completely abdicated its responsibilities: "The Commission has the impression that Treasury Board no longer considers its function
supervision as an important part of its responsibilities. "22

The way to make the Liberal Party of Canada
The sponsorship program adds to a long list of cases where programs and
Federal institutions were called upon to reward Liberal friends
from Canada. Commissioner Gomery aptly described liberal culture: "Throughout the
time when [the Department of Public Works] sowed the sponsorship money to the winds, he
ruled a kind of culture of "everything due to me." 23 Several records conducted by the liberal regime
testify to this culture.
Scandal of human resources
After destroying the EI system, the Liberals created the transitional Fund
job creation, in July 1996, to mitigate the effects of reforms, they said. Now this
program, which lasted only three years, has become under the leadership of Pierre Pettigrew a
real nest of patronage:

• the office of Minister Pierre Pettigrew, then program manager, has himself
involved in certain issues, notably the case of Cochrane Entertainment where he
bypassed the normal process project evaluation by announcing a grant
$ 2.5 million that had not yet been approved and about which its
officials expressed serious reservations.

The Canada Lands Company
Responsible for the Canada Lands Company (CLC), Alfonso Gagliano intervened to
many times with administrators to hire cronies including:
• Tony Mignacca, a friend of the Minister and a member of his organization who appeared
also before the Gomery Commission.
• Michèle Tremblay, a Liberal strategist and speech writer for Alfonso Gagliano
was hired by CLC for $ 5,000 per month;
• Tremblay-Guittet Communications firm received more than $ 10 million contracts
various departments since 1995;
• Robert Charest, brother of Jean Charest would have received $ 187,000 from the CIS from 1996
1998 without offering anything in return according to consulting firm Samson Bélair-Deloitte &
Touche concluded that even if it has been paid for two years of work, Mr. Charest has
not provided the corresponding services as a consultant and real estate broker.
Other examples
The Bloc Québécois also raised repeatedly the case of CINAR, a company whose leaders, relatives of the Liberal Party of Canada, have broken more rules.
No prosecution was ever brought in that case by the federal government. The block
Quebec also raised the case of the International Sports Montreal, an organization
whose leaders - relatives of the Liberal Party and Paul Martin - have squandered
public funds.

24 The case Conili Fashion Star: A few weeks before the outbreak of the 1997 elections, Pierre Pettigrew has approved a grant of
$ 719,850 to Modes Conili Star who was creating 160 jobs. In fact, the jobs will only be moved from one company to another.
The Placeteco affair Placeteco, led by a friend of Jean Chrétien, has received a grant of 1.2 million TJF. In addition to creating a trust,
in conflict with the attribution rules and grant the Treasury Board to collect funds Placeteco has not created any jobs.

The Liberal culture of patronage, waste and opacity
All these scandals show that the Liberal government's differences are not gestures
isolated, but rather that there is a real culture of patronage, waste and opacity
the Liberal Party of Canada. The gains made by the Bloc Québécois in the records
whistleblowers, political parties financing, independent ethics commissioner and
an independent public inquiry into the sponsorship program will definitely
help clean a little the federal government. The Bloc Québécois also proposes,
in the next section, a series of measures to increase the transparency of the federal government.
Finally, it should be stressed that the strengthening of the rules will be of no use if the
Government instructed to apply it ignores what the Liberals did in 15 years.

Paul Martin did not act on its own initiative
Even after the discovery of the sponsorship scandal, Paul Martin did not act on its own
initiative to shed light on this serious slippage and prevent abuse in the future.
On the contrary, having folded into a corner, the Liberal government
merely responded to pressure from the Bloc Québécois and the public. Removal of
Sponsorship Program and the creation of the Gomery Commission, for example, are
result of pressure exerted since 2000 by the Bloc Québécois to end it
political program, ban the use of intermediaries by the government and shed light
on this scandal.
The same goes for the dismissal of Mr. Marc Lefrançois, Jean Pelletier, André
Ouellet and Ambassador Alfonso Gagliano. Paul Martin said on 11 April: "It is
we who fired the leaders of a number of Crown corporations. It is we who
have recalled our ambassador to Denmark. "But the resignations of Pelletier and Gagliano
were claimed by the Bloc before Paul Martin decides to act.
Regarding the appointment of Mr. André Gauthier, responsible for recovering money paid
excess by the government to advertising agencies, she is also a belated response
Paul Martin to the Bloc Québécois political pressure. Indeed, the Bloc has demanded from summer 2002
that the federal government take steps to recover these amounts, but Mr. Gauthier
was appointed in February 2004 and no legal proceedings have been instituted before March 2005.
Finally, in a statement issued on 1 October 2004, the Bloc Québécois demanded that the
Liberal Party of Canada site "in trust questionable contributions until the end of the investigation
Justice Gomery. " This request had to be reformulated more than forty times in the House of
Commons before the Prime Minister announced, April 18, 2005, the creation of a trust where
would be deposited the dirty sponsorship money.
In creating this dirty money trust Paul Martin once again yielded to a request
all opposition parties had supported in the opposition day of the Bloc Québécois on
the sponsorship scandal.

For the rest of the things, the presence of the Bloc Québécois in Ottawa is essential. let's remember that
only one hundred $ million was repaid by the agencies and the Liberal Party of Canada
paid only $ 1.4 of the 5.4 million identified by the Bloc Québécois from the work of the
Gomery Commission.
The hesitations of Paul Martin to end the sponsorship program and create the
Gomery Commission indicate that the Bloc Québécois will be more necessary than ever to
Ottawa to ensure that the Gomery report is not tabletter.

Corrective action
Commissioner Gomery consulted the Bloc Québécois and other concerned groups
ethics and government transparency in order to prepare its second report. The current
section draws 72 recommendations made by the Bloc Québécois25 Commissioner
in October 2005.
Ethics Commissioner
The Liberal government replaced an ethics counselor powerless and beholden only
the Prime Minister by the Ethics Commissioner paralyzed by lack of resources. In
Either way, the result is the same: the controls on the ministers are nonexistent.
The Bloc Québécois proposes that the determination of agents operating budget
Parlement26 and the Ethics Commissioner is carried out by a parliamentary committee
(composed of one member per official political party represented in the House of Commons)
supported by a panel of experts and a representative office concerned.

Registrar of Lobbyists
The Registrar of Lobbyists has a key role in a democracy: it is responsible for ensuring that
exchanges between policymakers and private interests are undertaken in a transparent manner. Gold,
Registrar is not independent; it is an official, and destituable appointed by the Minister of
the Industrie27.
Thus, the one who is responsible for enforcing the Act Lobbyists Registration Act and the Code of
Lobbyists' conflicts of interest. First, it must ensure the transparency of
relations between ministers and lobbyists and, second, it must protect his employer, the Minister
Industry and other members of the Cabinet.
How can we believe that the Registrar be able to judge a lobbyist exerts "influence
reprehensible "on a public office holder if the lobbyist is also active
partisan.

If the leaders of Earnscliffe, involved in the leadership campaign of Paul
Martin and beneficiaries of research contracts awarded by the federal Minister of Finance,
in this regard is very revealing. How could the registrar to pick on Paul's friends
Martin, knowing that the latter, who became prime minister is ultimately his
boss?
Recall also the case René Fugère, this Shawinigan Liberal organizer who was in the lobby
on behalf of several firms soliciting Ottawa subsidies without registering. Despite
an RCMP investigation, federal prosecutors concluded in August 2000 that, in the words
Act Lobbyists Registration Act, the burden of proof was too demanding for a
conviction is likely.
The Bloc Québécois proposes that the Registrar of Lobbyists obtains the agent status
Parliament, for example, the Auditor General.
The Bloc Québécois also proposes that the Registrar has the mandate and the means to
investigate crimes.
In addition, we will propose amendments to the current system of registration of lobbyists
to extend the activities to be reported, to obtain a more serious application
the exclusion period for an official or an elected and increase the penalties
violators.

The Chief Electoral Officer must appoint returning officers
The reputation of efficiency and democratic transparency of the Quebec electoral system
known and recognized worldwide. In Quebec, since 1980, officials of good
elections are appointed by the Chief Electoral Officer. However, at
Federal, the returning officers are appointed by the ruling party. This practice
undemocratic and archaic leads to blatant cases of incompetence and partiality
denounces the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada.
In his last report to the Speaker of the House of Commons, following the
federal general elections of June 2004, the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada, Jean-Pierre Kingsley, deplored the fact that it can not ensure a uniform quality of service in
all of Canada when returning officers are appointed by the government. Worse,
He adds that some returning officers: "[...] feel they have not to respect his authority
because they have their appointment to another body. "
The Bloc Québécois will reintroduce a bill that will grant the Chief
Elections Canada powers similar to those held by his Quebec counterpart.

Whistleblower protection: do not allow whistleblowers to thank you for
Liberals!
The sponsorship scandal illustrates perfectly the need for a whistleblower protection mechanism. Recall that in 1996, Allan Cutler, a subordinate of Chuck
Guité, denounced the dubious practices of awarding contracts in the Ministry
responsible for federal visibility. But at the time, the Liberal government has buried history and
Allan Cutler left to thank you Chuck Guité. After suffering various humiliations and threats,
his post was abolished by Chuck Guité.
As a result of the sponsorship scandal, the government of Paul Martin has proposed a draft
(Bill C-11) for the disclosure of wrongdoing in the public sector and providing
a protection mechanism for whistleblowers. The Bloc Québécois managed to get that
the Commissioner responsible for the protection of whistleblowers is independent of government.
In the interest of many people who have been and will be witnesses of abuse and acts
reprehensible in the public sector, we believe it will be necessary to increase
whistleblower protection. Beyond C-11, many other battles still to be made.
The Bloc Québécois will propose to improve the wrongdoing disclosure channel
and the protection of whistleblowers in the public sector:
• claiming that the new Commissioner be approved by the leaders of the opposition;
• ensuring that the government does not have the ability to exclude Crown corporations,
foundations and any other federal agency of law enforcement;
• giving the commissioner more latitude to correct the harm imposed on
whistleblowers;
• whistleblowers facilitating access to the courts;
• ensuring that the new law does not serve as a pretext for the government
restrict the right to access to information.

Access to information
In a few months in power, the government of Paul Martin was able to earn the price of lemon
secretiveness. The following actions have contributed to this "success":
• the Martin government has sent several documents to the Commission censored
Gomery and refused to transmit several key documents to the Committee on the matter
Maher Arar;
• The Liberal government led Parliament in error by answering a question
the Order Paper. In a first response, in February 2003, the Government of
Paul Martin was estimated at 137 $ 500 The total amount paid to the family business
Paul Martin in a decade. Following opposition protests, the government
revised his answer in January 2004 to bring more than $ 161 million the total amount

Public sector pension schemes.
Martin still refuses to disclose the information to shed light on various
doubtful cases, such as:
• the use of $ 4.8 million transferred to Option Canada during the 1995 referendum;
• the decision of the Department of Justice not to institute criminal proceedings for
breach of copyright against CINAR firm and its founders, while a ratio
RCMP recommended otherwise;
• the name of the Minister who, after the report of the Auditor General, always defended
the Cabinet Committee on Communications communication agencies and their
abusive commissions;
• April 5, 2005, the government presented a discussion paper on reform
access to information. The document was criticized by all observers. In addition to
doubling the minimum administrative fees that we would call the citizens, the project
Martin government proposes to give up any of the numerous exceptions
under the law.
The Bloc Québécois will introduce a bill to improve access to information. this project
legislation will build on the bill introduced by the Information Commissioner in fall
2005. The following elements appear to us essential:
• the Access to Information Act should cover all Crown corporations and
Foundations, Agents of Parliament, MP offices and the offices of
ministers and the Prime Minister;
• Cabinet confidences should be subject to the law and revisions

• all exceptions should be subject to the primacy of the public interest;

• broadening the mandate of the Information Commissioner;
• Government officials should be required to put in writing their
decisions, actions, considerations and analysis;
• consulting services providers should be required to produce a deliverable

Foundations and corporations: more transparency and accountability
Until recently, the Auditor General did not have access to foundations and certain
Crown corporations, however, managing large sums.
André Ouellet to the escapades Canada Post, as well as the involvement of Via Rail Stations
Canada, CMHC and the Société du Vieux-Port in the sponsorship scandal Us
remember that it is important to subject the Crown corporations under scanner of the Auditor General.
The Bloc Québécois has long called for it to have access to Crown corporations and
foundations. In February 2005, the government retrieved the bill the Bloc Québécois (C-277)
and subject État29 foundations and corporations under the Auditor General.
The Bloc Québécois is pleased with this win but notes that the amendments to the
verification of foundations are conditional on reopening the funding agreements.
The Bloc Québécois will ensure that the government amend the management agreements to
allow the application of the new law.
The Bloc Québécois has long denounced the practice of the Liberal government that is
to divert and conceal some of its impressive surplus to place them in
foundations outside the control of Parliament and the Auditor General. At de
many times, the Auditor General had expressed extremely concerned about how
federally operated public money transfers to these foundations.
Over the past seven years, the federal government transferred $ 9 billion in
foundations he created. Of this amount, $ 7.7 billion are still sleeping in accounts
bank, while the federal government continues to deny the existence of the fiscal imbalance.
During that time, Quebec and the provinces are struggling with the challenge of financing
essential services such as health, education and infrastructure.
By dismantling the desired foundations, the Bloc Québécois will continue to denounce
camouflage budget surpluses through government foundations.
The Bloc Québécois will demand that the government can no longer exempt transfers to
foundations of the Treasury Board policy that prohibits payments to be made

Appointment Process
On March 17, 2004, during a speech to the Chamber of Commerce of Quebec, Paul Martin
had promised to end the favoritism: "The key thing to Ottawa will not know who you are
know. We are going to condemn to history the practice and politics of cronyism. "
During his leadership race PLC Paul Martin proposed to reform the appointment process, "the absolute powers of appointment which enjoys a prime minister are too extensive."
Paul Martin wanted to "[...] the qualifications of candidates to be considered by the
Appropriate standing committee before the nominations are confirmed. "30 However, as
Prime Minister Paul Martin has behaved in the same way that Jean Chrétien, in
multiplying partisan appointments and flouting the opinions of committees
Parliamentarians. The following examples are convincing.

Senior officials and CEOs of Crown corporations: to end the stranglehold
the "liberal network"
The Martin government has set a course of action and to announce publicly
subject to Parliamentary Committees appointments of senior officials and managers
Crown corporations. However, this policy was violated on numerous occasions. The
following examples show that Paul Martin is unwilling to end the patronage:
• September 16, 2004, Mario Laguë becomes Ambassador of the Republic of
Costa Rica by Paul Martin and Pierre Pettigrew. Laguë worked in the Prime
Minister Martin as Deputy Chief of Staff (Communications), from January to July
2004;
• the former mayor of Winnipeg and PLC defeated candidate in the 2004 elections, Glen Murray,
was appointed by Paul Martin, February 16, 2005, President of the National Round Table on
environment and économie31;
• former Liberal MP Yvon Charbonneau, was appointed as ambassador to
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), to
Paris, August 12, 2004.
Despite promises of Paul Martin and the various reports that have been presented, there is still
no formal review process of appointments of senior officials and officers
Crown corporations. This is all the more worrying since the former CEO of LPCQ Benedict
Corbeil, confirmed that "The Liberal network [...] controls everything: appointments, orders, contracts,
subsidies "32.
The Bloc Québécois believes that a formal appointments of senior review process
State officials and corporate executives must be a priority of the new
government. Parliamentary committees should be at the heart of decision making
and no appointment should not be made against the advice of the committees.

Appointment of senators
In a few months in power, Paul Martin appointed a series of senators linked to PLC:
• Francis Fox, former Deputy Minister of PLC from 1972 to 1984, he was principal secretary
Paul Martin when it came to power in December 2003;
• Dennis Dawson, former member of the PLC 1977 to 1984, a personal friend and adviser
Paul Martin, who was a candidate of the PLC in 2004 in Louis-Hébert;
• Art Eggleton, former Deputy Minister of PLC from 1993 to 2004, it is famous for offering
a $ 36,000 contract to a former girlfriend heart;
• Grant Mitchell, a former collaborator of Paul Martin (leadership campaign PLC
in 1990).
The Bloc Québécois believes that the Senate is an undemocratic institution, costly
and outdated.

Mode of appointment of judges of the Supreme Court
In 2003, the Bloc Québécois tabled a motion to review the appointment process
Supreme Court which was adopted unanimously. Since then, revelations us
have found that the problem is more widespread and that it is rather the entire federal appointment process of judges is questionable.
While there is no constitutional guarantee, the Supreme Court Act requires that three
nine posts of judges of the Supreme Court returned to Quebec judges. In the
context in which Quebec does not control all of its institutions, the appointment process
judges is crucial for Quebec.
The Liberal government responded by proposing to create, whenever a vacancy occurs
the highest court, an advisory committee would be responsible for evaluating applications for
the position to be filled. This proposal was rejected by the committee that the considered significantly
insufficient.
The Bloc Québécois proposes instead:
• Québec or the government of the province or region where there is a job opening
proposes a closed list;
• a committee, on which sit among other MPs, performs
Review this list;
• The list is then submitted to the Federal Justice and the Premier Minister
make the final choice.
The Bloc Québécois will continue to demand a reform of the judicial appointment process
Supreme Court which provides that each item returns to a Quebec nominee
by the Quebec government.

The mode of appointment of judges in Ottawa
If it is particularly urgent to create a proper appointment process for judges of the Court
Court of Canada whose current nomination does not meet any formal mechanism, it appears
increasingly important in the wake of recent allegations of cronyism, to review the transparency of the appointment process of the federal judiciary.
Recall that the former general manager of the Quebec section of the PLC, Benoît Corbeil, has
recently confirmed that '[...] a person who wishes to be appointed a judge [...] should be links
friends with these people [members of the Liberal network], which can influence the device
political "33.
A few days later, the chief justice of the Quebec Court of Appeal, Michel Robert, a Liberal
longtime including having chaired the Liberal Party of Canada from 1986 to 1990, in rajoutait
and stated that "[...] to hold office in the judiciary federally appointed, I
think this is a kind of prerequisites that must not be sovereignty [...] "34.
Following these revelations, the Bloc Québécois was able to obtain the Presidency and the creation of a
Deputy Justice Committee to study the process for appointment to the federal judiciary.
The Bloc Québécois will continue to work to depoliticize the judicial appointment process.

CHAPTER II - DEVELOPMENT
SUSTAINABLE QUEBEC
Sovereignty will allow Quebec to develop a genuine policy of
sustainability
Quebec is facing, like all companies, limits the unrestrained development that characterized the industrial world in the last decades. It is now necessary to combine
economic development and quality of life, not by opposing one to the other as it was
too often the case in the past, but by combining from a long term perspective.
This sustainable development policy is intended to provide future generations of
Quebecers a more prosperous, more united, which provides better
quality of life for all in a healthier environment and in a world ruled by the law and
international solidarity. There is the potential for a new "quiet revolution".
This is an ambitious but necessary project. All countries that want to progress will have to
get there, sooner or later. The Bloc Québécois proposes that Quebec put it as soon as possible,
which will give it in the future, a decisive advantage.
It would be unrealistic for Quebec, thinking accomplish such an ambitious project without having the
tools that are the prerogative of sovereign countries. Decisions taken by a sovereign country
areas such as economy, environment, foreign or development policy
Social have multidimensional effects.
For example, the ratification and implementation of the Kyoto Protocol by Canada, which are
mainly foreign policy decisions, will have obvious effects on the environment and the economy, but also on the regional development, energy policy
Quebec, transportation or scientific research and public finances.
Membership of Quebec in the Canadian federal system is an important brake. The federal government, by cutting transfers to Quebec, caused significant financial problems to the Quebec education system. It hampers economic growth
Quebec in the areas of research, training of the workforce and
manufacturing. The federal government also has a death toll that has much
contributed with the fiscal imbalance, to undermine Quebec's social climate.
Quebec culture remains, for the federal government, a single regional component
Canadian culture. Finally, instead of moving Canada towards sustainable environmental practices, it supports the coal, oil, nuclear energy and
genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
All this goes against the fundamental interests of Quebec. We must now turn the tide
things to allow Quebec to not lose all the advantages he has. It's here
task that give the Applicants of the Bloc Québécois in the coming years.

2.1 The environment: a Québec water and wind
In the early 21st century, probably climate change is one of the challenges
most important confronting humanity. The magnitude of the consequences of this
phenomenon is dizzying: increase in natural disasters such as floods, forest fires, tropical storms, ice storms or tidal waves,
lower levels of some rivers, flooding of inhabited land, migration and disappearance of thousands of animal species, and melting icecaps.
It is in this context that will soon open the Montreal Conference on changes
climate. This conference is very important and the Bloc Québécois considers
more than the first phase, that Kyoto was only a modest first step.
Quebec is well placed to more than its share in the fight against climate change,
but also to derive significant economic benefit. Quebec has in fact two
major assets: water and wind to hydro and wind power. The wind
could become one of the great natural resources of Quebec.
Quebec These benefits are however at risk. Currently, the Canadian plan of implementation
implementation of the Kyoto Protocol supports the big polluters, imposes a disproportionate financial burden on taxpayers in Quebec and in no way recognizes the efforts and results
Quebec since 1990. In fact, this plan rewards polluters, and requires that he pay Quebec
for others, which goes completely counter to its fundamental interests.
Water is certainly another great natural wealth of Quebec. The St. Lawrence by
example, is both a symbol of Quebec identity, a source of drinking water, a motor
economic development, a waterway, a floral and wildlife rich natural environment
and a major tourist attraction. Quebec has one of the largest water reserves
sweet of the world, and an important hydroelectric potential. It is this reality that led
the Bloc Québécois to form a St. Lawrence Caucus in 2004 and to conduct a
consultation tour across Québec on the future of the St. Lawrence.
They then found that the natural integrity of the St. Lawrence was threatened by decisions
federal government. The Seaway widening project is the threat
the most serious. For now, the Bloc Québécois and its partners have managed to block it
project, but we must remain vigilant. The other threat on the horizon is a
possible diversion of Great Lakes water to quench the thirst of some endless States
American, which could affect the flow of the St. Lawrence. Shoreline erosion, protection
Ecosystems and control of maritime traffic are also major issues.
The quality of food that Quebecers eat is an important factor
public health. In recent years, the issue of food security was at
heart of a broad social debate. Foods that contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs), for example, many consumers worried. Farmers
worry about the proliferation of GMO crops in fields and contamination of these

36

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

GMO crops that are exempt. The Quebecers have for their
share overwhelmingly in favor of mandatory labeling of foods that contain
GMOs. Yet the federal government is going against that opinion, by refusing to impose
such a practice. This is contrary to the interests of Quebecers.
Environmental protection has long been opposed to economic growth, such as
if one would necessarily be at the expense of the other. This argument no longer holds
today. Sustainable economic growth requires environmental practices
sustainable. Reconciling these two objectives is the challenge of choice for companies in
early 21st century. Quebec is in position to benefit like few other nations.
We must seize this opportunity.
The sovereign Quebec will allow us to achieve this goal, as have all the
legislative tools and financial means to put forward such a policy.

2.2 The Quebec energy and the Kyoto Protocol
The Quebec energy harnessed by Ottawa
The sovereign Quebec will have all the tools to go green and simultaneously
seize opportunities to reorient its economy towards more sustainable practices.
Currently, Canada's 2005 Plan for the implementation of Kyoto undermines efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse Quebec and is a real impediment to prosperity
by charging Quebecers for others. The sovereign Quebec,
otherwise, will be adapted to the Quebec political realities that will enable it to fight
efficiently and cost against climate change.
Currently, Quebec is stuck in the vibrant Canadian. This ensures that the setting
implementing Kyoto is a burden, whereas for a sovereign Quebec will be an opportunity Kyoto
exceptional progress. Everything is explained by the fact that Quebec produces much less
greenhouse gas per capita than Canada, it has already invested a lot in the past to
reduce emissions on its territory without the help of Canada and that, as long as it is part of
Canada, he must assume the cost reductions provinces like Alberta and Ontario.

Produce and export clean energy
At a time of climate change, exporting clean energy provides significant environmental benefits, since it allows to substitute clean energy from other sources
energy such as coal, oil, natural gas or nuclear. Quebec
has great potential for wind energy production, energy technology more
more profitable, very clean and the source of the wind, is absolutely free and renewable.
The sovereign Quebec will significantly increase its production of clean energy here
2025, for its own needs and for export to the North American market. The
Development of wind energy includes a manufacturing component, so as to maximize the
economic impact in Québec and opportunities for export of equipment
wind.
Find alternatives to oil
Quebec imports all the oil it consumes. According to the Quebec Department
Finance, an increase of $ 7 price per barrel of oil corresponds to a net puncture
$ 1.3 billion in the Quebec economy. The outlook suggesting an increase
continuous oil price over the next few years are worrying in this regard and
seem to confirm. The Canadian economy, unlike the Quebec benefits from rising
oil prices, particularly Alberta, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and the federal government.
Moreover, one day or another oil resources will be depleted. The world economy
will then turn to other sources of cleaner energy. Overall, the
fossil fuels account for 86% of all energy consumed in the world. These sources
fossil fuels are very harmful to the environment. In addition, the oil is at the origin of
multiple conflicts, its price fluctuates constantly and many of his sources of supply
are located in politically unstable regions.

38

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

Quebec has every interest in reducing its dependence on oil, especially since it is not
a producer himself. Remarkably, from 1981 to 2001, the share of oil in the
Quebec's energy consumption rose from 56% to 38%. The sovereign Quebec will
reduce the share of oil in the Quebec energy consumption to 10% by 2025.

Establish a green wool socks
To get out of the oil economy will substitute other energy sources and
other materials to oil. It will enhance research efforts in this area,
develop new technologies and adapt existing technologies, modify certain
our practices and save energy much more. To do this, we will need resources.
The sovereign Quebec will be a "green woolen stockings," a development fund
sustainable, that will fund various initiatives to come out of the oil economy. This fund
may be funded from clean energy exports and a surtax on profits
majors working in Quebec.

Quebec commercialize innovations
Leave the oil economy by developing wind power as well as new
energy and environmental technologies will allow Quebec to innovate and take
certain technological lead over the economies slow to make this shift. It is in this
mind that a sovereign Quebec will adopt a technology commercialization office
Quebec's environmental and energy for export.
Implementation of a global fellowship of tradable permits
The Quebecers have enthusiastically supported the ratification of the Protocol
Kyoto. The sovereign Quebec will ratify this treaty and will contribute to achieving its objectives
innovative. The reduction of sulfur emissions in the 1980s has greatly benefited
a tradable permit mechanism launched at the Chicago Stock Exchange. In the same spirit,
representatives of the Montreal Exchange have proposed the creation of a stock exchange license
exchangeable under the Kyoto Protocol. The Bloc Québécois proposes the establishment
such a scholarship. This scholarship, based in Montreal, will benefit from the current specialization
the Montreal Exchange, or derivatives.

Incentive programs for wind power
According to specialists, Québec offers one of the largest wind potential in North America.
But the Incentive program for wind energy (WPPI) Government
Federal imposes ceilings that may slow the Quebec initiatives, which shows
particularly dynamic in terms of wind energy development, all under
pretext to allow all regions of the country to participate in the program.
Just as it did in the past for the development of the oil industry, the Canadian government must fund where it is most economical to do so, in other words, there
where investors are the most dynamic. With 1,000 MW of wind turbines to be
built in 2012, the recent announcement of an additional 2000 MW and the immense potential
Quebec, wind power will soon be in Quebec what oil is to Alberta. The government
Federal must be consistent with his past deeds and give Quebec support
Financial unmarked by provincial equity concerns, worries he did not have when he was
time to finance the development of the hydrocarbon industry.
The Bloc Québécois proposes to enhance the WPPI envelope to allow the creation of
4,000 additional MW for a total of 8000 MW within 10 years and to create a new
Incentive of wind energy with a small power

The anxiety caused by emissions of greenhouse gases have also relativized
the environmental impact that may have hydroelectric dams. Combined with
agreements between Quebec and Aboriginal nations, this new situation should normally
allow Quebec to launch the equivalent of a new James Bay. Until recently,
the federal government was an obstacle to new projects of hydroelectric dams, since it refused to harmonize its environmental policy with that of Quebec,
which greatly slowed the progress of projects.

2.3 The implementation of the Kyoto Protocol
A dismal Plan
For years, the Bloc Québécois demands an implementation plan for the Kyoto Protocol
to achieve three objectives:
• reduction of Canadian greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 6%
at 1990, the goal is committed to reaching Canada from 2008
2012;
• the application of the polluter pays principle;
• fairness, especially to Quebec.
The 2005 implementation plan filed by Stéphane Dion, federal Minister
Environment is against these three objectives. This plan does not achieve the
objectives that Canada has set, it applies the polluter-paid and it is particularly
unfair to Quebec. It is therefore lamentable plan.

A programmed failure
The 2005 plan lacks credibility. In Kyoto in 1997, Canada committed to reducing its
GHG emissions by 6% compared to 1990. However, GHG continued
to increase over the years and Canada's objective now is to reduce GHG
more than 30%! The procrastination of the federal government shall ensure that Canada is very
late.
It is difficult to imagine that he will succeed in achieving its objectives. Especially since the plan includes
measures that will be slow to develop. In fact, the bulk of the plan remains to be implemented. The
worst part of it is probably minimal effort is required of the biggest polluters,
particularly oil producers. It is unlikely that Canada could
achieve its reduction targets without the oil and gas industry, whose emissions
will have increased by 99% between 1990 and 2010, put to use.

Canada pollution havens
Rather than applying the principle of polluter pays, the Minister Stéphane Dion has decided to reward polluters. The actual reduction target he has chosen to attribute to oil and
Gas is less than 20 megatonnes (Mt) when it is already expected that this sector emits more
144 Mt of GHG in 2010, representing 17% of total estimated emissions for that period. For
assume its fair share, the oil sector should reduce by an average of 46 Mt his
GHG emissions during the period 2008-2012. The target assigned to it is much
too low and transfers the reduced burden on taxpayers.
In addition, the plan provides reward polluters by providing public subsidies
guaranteeing them a price ceiling for emissions credits. Finally, the government
Federal decided to use a voluntary agreement with the automotive industry providing
a reduction target of 5.3 Mt by 2010, which is clearly insufficient, given that the
Road transport is responsible for 18% of total GHG emissions in Canada.

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

43

If the automotive sector should reduce its emissions by 6% compared to 1990, its target
reduction greatly exceed 40 Mt, 8 times more than the voluntary agreement. All these
measures mean that it is the Quebec and Canadian taxpayers who will have to pay
for the oil industry and automotive.

A government at the service of the oil industry
Last September, in his Canadian Environmental Review, the OECD recommended the
elimination of harmful subsidies to the environment such as fuels
fossil stating that they "should be removed since they may
lead to overuse or over-consumption of resources or have negative consequences for the environment ".
Despite this warning, the federal government continues to support financially the industry
hydrocarbons as was the case over the last 30 years. A recent study
conducted by the Pembina Institute found that Ottawa had gifts exceeding the
billion dollars for the oil and gas industry between 1996 and 2002. In 2003,
Liberal government introduced Bill C-48 that allowed and will allow the oil
squeeze the treasury $ 55 million in 2003-2004, $ 100 million in 2004-2005 to 260 million in
2007-2008.
While the federal government continues to subsidize the oil industry and
Gas, however he refuses to subsidize organizations as essential to the fight against
climate change that Experimentation Centre of Quebec electric vehicles
(CEVEQ), this non-profit Quebec company that has developed over the last 10
years leading expertise in clean transportation.
The federal government has also rewarded the oil when negotiating the target
reducing greenhouse gas major emitters. Not only the government reduced
significantly reducing their obligations, but has also developed a system called
"Intensity reduction" allowing them to increase their production without any reduction
their only extra is requested. Knowing that the production of crude oil and petroleum
from the oil sands will double between 2002 and 2015, while industries
manufacturing and pulp and paper in Quebec, for example, maintain their level
Production is understood that this effort is doubly unfair to leave Quebec, whose
taxes will be used to spare the Alberta oil swimming in profits.

the hydropower Quebec must necessarily achieve additional reductions, a
almost superhuman effort considering that they already emit very little greenhouse gas.

The inadequate federal programs
The One-Tonne Challenge and EnerGuide programs are two glaring examples of the importance
Quebec being the prime contractor on its territory. The One-Tonne Challenge invites citizens and
citizens to reduce their production of one tonne of emissions while
EnerGuide program aims to share with the owners the costs of improving efficiency
energy of their homes. Both programs are poorly adapted to Quebec where the vast
Most people warm themselves and illuminate long to hydroelectric energy,
clean energy.
$ 10 billion
The Ottawa plan involves investments of $ 10 billion over the next
decade. Half of the investments will finance the climate of the Fund, an envelope with
which Ottawa will pay big polluters to reduce their emissions to buy credits luimême organizations, businesses and individuals to whom he has granted
offset credits and to finance the purchase of credits abroad. The remainder of the envelope is
for various federal programs.
Polluter-paid
Following a commitment made by the federal government, which will have the big polluters
buy credits to meet their target will not disburse more than $ 15 per tonne, although
These credits are more valuable on the market. Analysts expect prices
Credit will reach $ 25 Canadian per tonne during the first Kyoto commitment period,
the difference being assumed by Ottawa, so by all taxpayers. In addition to being
unfair for Quebec taxpayers who will pay for the oil, capping completely will short-circuit the self-regulating effect of the credit market. Moreover, the target
20 Mt attributed to the oil and gas industry is much too low and transfers
reducing burden on the shoulders of taxpayers.
Ottawa buys the credits it grants
This money is spent unnecessarily. There will be a credit market with enough actors
Economic for the federal government did not get involved and spend unnecessarily
public funds.
Overseas credit purchase
The Bloc Québécois is opposed to the federal government massively buying these credits
with public funds. Experts believe that if the federal plan is not revised, Canada
miss its more than 100 Mt reduction target At a conservative price of $ 20 per tonne
on the international market, this means that more than $ 2 billion of taxpayers would
swallowed up so that Canada complies with its international commitments. This is a very
bad strategy and wasting money abroad when there is so much to do here. The
government must increase the target and let the big polluters buy
themselves the credits to comply with their reduction obligations.

The plan of the Bloc Québécois
The federal government has designed a plan to save the big polluters and
send the bill to taxpayers. This approach, in addition to being particularly
harmful to the Quebec economy and unfair to businesses and taxpayers
Quebec, is poorly adapted to the reality of Quebec. It significantly harm the efforts
what should Quebec to reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions.
It is ironic that the dunce of the class - Canada - imposes a penalizing Plan
the best student - Quebec - to help him. It is therefore urgent for Quebec, to demand
opt out with full compensation.
The federal government should transfer to Quebec the amounts necessary for this great
mission. Of the $ 10 billion on the table in Ottawa, $ 2 billion from the pockets
Quebec taxpayers.
The Bloc Québécois is therefore asking the federal government to negotiate quickly with the
Quebec an agreement that will allow Quebec to opt out with full compensation of all
federal programs Kyoto implementation, to enable it to apply
appropriate measures in its territory to fight against climate change.

Participation of Quebec offsets system
The target imposed on Quebec industries ignores the efforts they have made
in the past. To determine the targets assigned to each industrial sector, said Ottawa
the emission level in 2010 will reach everyone in a business as usual scenario. However, the target
assigned to Quebec industries are disproportionate compared to the negligible stress
asked the major polluters such as oil and thermal sectors. Otherwise,
since the Quebec industries have already succeeded in reducing emissions by nearly
10% since 1990, the last efforts required of them are the most difficult to achieve
and the most expensive. It is unacceptable that the federal plan penalizes Quebec industries
were responsible and forward-thinking.
From the time the Québec can benefit from the right to opt out with full compensation,

For Quebec to participate in the offset system, which is

• not to buy himself credit or abroad or organizations;
• renounce assume part of the cost of credits will have to buy big

Finally, the Bloc Québécois will ask the next federal government to put forward,
in its own areas of competence, truly effective measures against
climate change.
The Bloc Québécois will ask:
• strict regulations on vehicle manufacturing standards which will provide for
heavy penalties for non-compliance;
• the elimination of the GST on the purchase of new vehicles that consume less than 5 liters
gasoline at 100 Km;
• grants to organizations that work to fight changes
climate as CEVEQ;
• the creation of a tax deduction passes for transport
in common;
• Energy-efficient labeling mandatory on new or used vehicles sold
Canada.

The second phase of implementation of the Convention on Climate Change
To take advantage of the Montreal Conference on Climate Change, the Bloc Québécois
considers that the federal government should lead the industrialized countries to renew their
reduction commitments after 2012 and persuade the emerging countries, which currently benefit from a reduction leave to make quantified and binding commitments
the second period.
In addition, the Bloc Québécois believes that the government must create a negotiating table
with Quebec and the provinces to achieve a fair agreement distributing the effort
overall territory as to the commitment that Canada will take for the second phase.

the episode of Mad Cow disrupt markets and expensive both on the State and producers

The sovereign Quebec will provide to producers by protection in the event of a health crisis
occurring elsewhere in North America. A sovereign Quebec would not have been affected by the crisis
mad cow in Alberta, for example.
To ensure food security and access to markets for our producers, Quebec
Sovereign may adopt the following policies:
• an integrated system of traceability, from the farm to retailer.
In addition to enabling a rapid and effective response in a crisis, such a system
Quebec producers will ensure access to foreign markets;
• government support genomics research applied to food security,
not only for Quebec livestock, but also for export;

plate and make a free and informed choice. It will also allow producers here
access to foreign markets that require such labeling. Such a policy can not
be implemented in parallel with a traceability policy.

Food security and freedom to choose
The Bloc Québécois has repeatedly expressed its concerns about the lack of a
mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods, inadequate zones
protection, as well as the lack of transparency of the federal government. The block
Quebec also has long called for Canada to ratify the Cartagena Protocol on
GMOs and biosafety, which aims to put in place controls on such tags

2.5 Education as a profitable investment
Education is the cornerstone of corporate development. The current Quebec already has a
policy of high performance education. All it lacks are the financial tools and
Ottawa currently owned by government, such as the control of all
Taxes, research funding programs, training programs and
access to international forums.
The sovereign Quebec will complement this policy with financial tools and
it lacks government - such as parts of the formation of labor and
funds currently in Ottawa - to ensure that education is at the forefront
priority. Similarly, inconsistencies like the one that Quebec is penalized
financially because he chose to keep tuition affordable will
eliminated the day advancing to Quebec sovereignty.
The sovereign Quebec will also include a target to invest one hand always
increasing its collective wealth in education, starting from the idea that it is the most profitable investment economically, socially and culturally that can make a
company.
Finally, Quebecers will be able to create a goal to be among the
top five OECD countries in the level of public and private investment in
research and development.

The education funding
Quebec's population is becoming more educated. Significant financial efforts were
made over the past decades by the Quebec community to increase access to education and these efforts have plentifully, both economically and for
the quality of life of Quebecers.
These achievements are threatened by the Canadian government. At a time when education becomes a duty
the most important of governments to allow increased wealth and improved health and quality of life, the financial effort of the federal government, which passes through
transfers to Quebec, is in sharp decline. Originally, the federal contribution accounted
50% of the costs of postsecondaire35 education. But it is only 18% aujourd'hui36.
While education is a priority for Quebecers, their taxes
Ottawa used for anything else.
In fact, the federal Liberal government prefers to create specific programs that ignore
particularities of the Quebec education system. The simplest and most effective solution -
a substantial increase in transfers to Quebec - is ignored even though it is
consensus in Quebec.
35 This cost-shared program was launched in 1967.

The Quebec government, which must finance the health system and to deal with the throttle
Financial imposed by Ottawa does not have sufficient fiscal resources for
ensure increased funding of the Quebec education system, whether at levels
primary, secondary, college or university. Quebec, if it wants to meet the challenge of its
sustainable development, however, must make education its top priority.

Tax credit for tuition: Quebec penalized
Following the increase in tuition fees in Canada, government tax credits
Federal increased approximately 60% from 1998 to 2003, from $ 800 million to nearly
1.3 billion $ 37. This is a considerable amount that the federal government chose
indirectly devoted to postsecondary education. But in doing so, the government
Federal penalizes Quebec students, since Quebec has chosen the accessibility
PSE.
The Bloc Québécois is committed to continue the battle on the fiscal imbalance so
that the Quebec government is able to adequately fund its system
education.

Funding for college and university studies
Traditionally, Ottawa helps fund post-secondary education in Quebec
and in the provinces through transfers. However, since 1994-1995, transfers dedicated
to education and social programs have experienced drastic cuts, from
$ 10.6 billion in 1994-1995 to $ 8.4 billion for the current fiscal year. This means
the federal government will spent 7.8% of its revenue in 1995, while in 2006 there
will have spent only 4.2% of its revenue.

Tax exemption scholarships
The Quebec government has long been a loans and bursaries program for
students of colleges and universities. Now, through taxation, the federal government takes away
Hand students some scholarships paid by Quebec and other organizations. It
goes against the Quebec policy of student aid, since
Federal government takes back with one hand what the Quebec government
on the other.
The Bloc Québécois will require the full tax exemption for scholarships.

Ending discrimination against students
In recent years, the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act provides that persons who
a debt to finance their education can not rely on the provisions of the
law only if they have completed their education for 10 years. This clause only applies to
student debt, which is an unacceptable discrimination.
To this end, the Bloc Québécois supported Bill C-236 which aimed to significantly reduce
the deadline before which a student can not be released by the bankruptcy of its student debt.

2.6 Arts and culture
The arts and culture in a sovereign Quebec
The arts and culture are the foundation on which the Quebec identity is based. Nowadays,
A fundamental role of sovereignty is to preserve the ability of a nation
develop, preserve and promote culture. The sovereign Quebec will be able to give as
target of an ever increasing share of its collective wealth to support the arts and
Quebec culture, while radiation and preservation of Quebec culture
will be one of the fundamental pillars of its foreign policy.
Ottawa refuses to recognize Quebec culture
Quebec culture is recognized in Québec and abroad for its dynamism and originality. The Quebecers are fond of Quebec cultural productions:
radio and television, of course, but also the cinema, theater and dance, while remaining
very open to foreign cultural productions. Yet the federal government refuses
to recognize the specific reality of Quebec culture. For him, it is a mere
regional component of Canadian culture.
In addition, cultural policies of the federal government often have utility, that of
promote Canadian identity, pride and unity. State support for culture should be free
any political objective. It should enable creative and creators of the cultural sector
to express a point of view on all issues affecting humanity, not finance
productions according to criteria based on Canadian identity.
The Bloc Québécois will continue to defend and promote Quebec culture and
Federal denounce any attempt to use cultural programs for propaganda purposes
policy. The Bloc Québécois also continue to provide support to creative and
Quebec creators and to work for the recognition of the principle of diversity
cultural nationally and internationally.

Satellite Radio: the threat comes from space
In a decision of 16 June 2005, endorsed by the Liberal government in September 2005,
Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) granted two
satellite radio licenses to companies using US satellites. In so doing,
Canada voluntarily agreed to losing effective control and complete its broadcasting. From
Moreover, this decision limited to 2.5% francophone content and 10% Canadian content in
this new medium, unlike the 35% imposed by the policy on commercial radio.
Throughout this process, the Bloc Québécois was the only party in the House to denounce this
CRTC decision constitutes a breach in broadcasting policy.
The Bloc Québécois will continue to demand the modification of radio licensing terms

For better financing of cultural activities
To help improve the financing of the creators, the Movement for the Arts and
Letters (MAL) and the Bloc Québécois have been demanding for two years that the federal government
the annual budget of the Canada Council for the Arts be increased significantly, rising to
$ 300 million. It can thus substantially increase the number and level of grants
granted to individual artists, as well as subsidies granted to organizations.
Thus, not only the number of cultural production does increase, but such an initiative
promote the increase artists' income, artisans and cultural workers.
The Minister of Canadian Heritage announced a few days before the outbreak of
elections, 23 November 2005, an increase in the Council budget for the Arts.
The Bloc Québécois will ensure that the Federal Government's commitment
pre-election and the budget of the Canada Council for the Arts be raised to reach
an annual budget of $ 300 million.

Book Policy
The definition of the identity of a people through its cultural production. In this regard, literature
is fundamental and we are collectively accountable for what we are
our writers.
The situation of writers in Quebec is dramatic. Just 9% of them rely on their
copyright as the main source of revenu38. The lack of adequate measures
support from the federal government is particularly acute and is not part
negligible problem. Thus, writers have seen their average payment Commission
PLR go from $ 821 to $ 679 for the Liberals in 1993.
Yet the Canadian government continues to impose the public lending rights and rights
Copyright while Quebec has decided to exempt writers.
The Bloc Québécois is asking the federal government to offer tax exemption on
the rights of auteur39 and public lending rights and raise to $ 40 public lending rights.
According to the International Publishers Association, in 2001, Canada was one of the G7 countries
imposed the highest taxes on reading material. The United States, Japan, Great Britain, Russia and Ireland are among the countries which have understood the importance of not taxing
books for easy access.
In Quebec, the QST does not apply to books since November 1990. However, GST
still applies to sales of new and used books in Canadian taxation, although the
Liberal Paul Martin's commitment to abolish it in 1992. For a company that claims to bet
on the acquisition, development and enhancement of knowledge, unless one
can say is that there is a profound contradiction.

Documentary Film Fund
Telefilm Canada administers, since 1 April 2001, the Feature Film Fund of Canada and
the main objective is to increase audiences for Canadian feature films in the room,
to achieve 5% share of the Canadian market by 2006.
Quebec, where Quebec films accounted for 21% of cinema admissions in 2004, and
far, the film leader. But this fund is strictly dedicated to feature films and,
despite the spectacular rebirth of the documentary film support measures to such
cinema are clearly insufficient.
That is why the Bloc Québécois called for the creation of a fund of Documentary Film
Film and Imax Theatre and the amounts allotted to Quebec cinema testify
Quebec habits of cultural consumption.

The living conditions of artists
The work of artists in Quebec and Canada is characterized by insecurity and the fact that they
occasionally receive large sums in a single payment for a
work extending over a long period of time.
The share of self-employment in the cultural sector is more than two and a half times greater than in the rest of the workforce (27.4% against 10.4%). This reality makes
artists particularly precarious workers. Meanwhile, from 1991 to 2001,
the number of cultural professions in Quebec grew by 23.9%, according to a
study of the Institut de la statistique du Québec January 2005.
Given the precariousness of the professional status of artists and professionals in the areas of
culture and communications, the Bloc Québécois believes that it is urgent to act. He asks
So the federal government to allow the spread over five years of artists' income. A
Such a measure exists in several countries: Germany, the Netherlands, France, UK, etc.
It can absorb fluctuations in artists' income, and to better reflect the
how they are paid.
The Bloc Québécois will table a bill to permit income averaging for artists
over a period of five years.
Moreover, from the self-employed status quarter of workers'
Cultural gives them no access to employment insurance system, which is not designed to
adapt to atypical work. The artisans of television, film and culture have a status
precarious and fluctuating incomes.

The region artists for better access to the media
The artistic and cultural creation in region contributes extraordinarily diversity
Quebec cultural. Yet our artists need a broadcaster (radio or television)
to promote themselves often collide with media access difficulties.
Unfortunately, these broadcasters tend to focus on the values ​​"safe", neglecting
promising artists who have not yet been recognized at fair value in their
middle. In this context, emerging artists living in the region have no choice but to
winning major centers to increase their chances to break.
There would therefore be allowed to regions minimal media space so that their creative
and their creators can live and express themselves with dignity. If the regional media increased their local or regional cultural content, they could contribute to improving diversity
Cultural while allowing know and appreciate the many talents who show it
in all areas of cultural activity: music, song, theater, dance and
other disciplines.
The Bloc Québécois therefore proposes the establishment of incentives promoting the dissemination and
the recognition of regional cultural works and the emergence of new
talents. The Bloc Québécois believes that these measures should ensure access for artists
regional to a minimum of 10% of the media space devoted to culture.

Financing of community media
Radio and community television are very valuable for the population. The block
Quebec agrees to raise a debate on this issue so that their funding
be revised upwards.
An inclusive culture subtitling on television
Nearly three million people in Canada live with a hearing problem, which
750,000 in Quebec alone. Faced with the ever-increasing aging of the population,
this situation will only get worse. More than ever aware of this issue, the
Bloc Québécois will continue to actively support the right to communications of people

2.7 The Quebec economy and globalization
The prospects of a sovereign Quebec
Quebec sovereignty will enable it to implement a development policy
sustainable economic. The objectives of such a policy will be:
• increase the prosperity of individuals and of all Quebecers;
• increase the quality of life of Quebecers;
• increase the quality of the environment.
These objectives must be integrated so that they are mutually supportive rather than
to oppose. For example, the Bloc Québécois believes that extending the hours of work for
increase economic growth affects the quality of life. Similarly, increasing the consumption
Oil for purposes of economic growth has disastrous effects on the environment.
Conversely, building on the knowledge, training, research, technology and innovation
allows to increase prosperity while improving the quality of life. Building on production
clean energy, such as hydro and wind power, or bet on the development of green technologies can both increase prosperity and environmental quality.
Sovereignty will allow Quebec to harmonize several of the state functions in favor
a coherent and sustainable development of Quebec: education and training of the workforce, taxation, trade, industrial policy and regional development, taxation,
research and development, public works and infrastructure, labor laws and the environment. All these tools can be arranged to achieve the objectives that Quebec
will be fixed.

Develop employment throughout Quebec, in a context of strong global competition
Employment is at the heart of economic and social development. Employment is the primary means
participation in the creation and redistribution of wealth. The job is a condition
significant integration to society and achievement of people.
Exclusion is Poverty, unemployment, underemployment and economic and social insecurity.
The exclusion is costly to everyone, starting with those who are excluded from the market
work, but also in tax revenues, in revenues, in addition to working conditions
low. It affects women, children and youth. It is the origin of drama
human and social problems that need alone that employment remains a priority
for Quebec society.
It is true that in total, the employment situation in Quebec has improved significantly, especially in
development corridors as the axis of Drummondville, Victoriaville Montérégie. On the outside
these axes, growth is slower.
In fact, Quebec is facing a triple challenge of continuing to combat unemployment
rampant in several regions and threatening entire sectors of the economy, that of ensuring the

growing economy in a global trading environment and of
address the skilled labor shortage is increasing every year and undermines
growth in several regions and sectors of activity.
Sovereign countries have more tools at their disposal and are better able to have
employment policies integrated and able to respond to the diversity of situations. Quebec
Sovereign will focus its investments in economic sectors where it has a
decisive advantage. It could properly articulate and regional development policies
Sectoral and have a real strategy for training the workforce.
The federal government policies have reduced the capacity for action of the Quebec nation. To
Over the decades, Ottawa has significantly weakened the industrial fabric of Quebec by any
a series of measures including Ontario and Western Canada have benefited. Whether the pipe
St. Lawrence, the Borden40 line, support for oil industries, while contributing
depriving the Quebec economy of part of its means of development. Without
sovereignty, there can be no complete catch!
An employment strategy can not be implemented effectively if it is the subject
a strong social consensus. It requires the participation of all components of society
and all levels of public administration (educational institutions, municipalities,
etc.). All these institutions under the jurisdiction of Quebec. Any coherent policy
requires integration of all tools in the field. Ottawa and its centralizing vision prohibit this.
The Bloc Québécois will continue to act to ensure that Quebec has the largest
number of possible ways to the growth of its economy and its jobs,
to facilitate the accession of Quebec to full sovereignty.

Investing in infrastructures41
The sovereign Quebec will have all of its financial resources. As such, he will be
able to establish a long-term plan to invest in its infrastructure. Currently, the
fiscal imbalance prevents the Quebec government - and also the municipalities - to invest
enough in the repair and construction of infrastructure.
Statistics Canada estimates that 18% of the increase in business productivity from 1961 to
2000 and all sectors is due to investments in infrastructure (roads, networks
transit, water systems and water treatment).

40 In 1961, the federal government decided to encourage western oil by preventing Quebec companies that manufactured
products imported petroleum to sell their production to the west of the Ottawa River. The "Borden line" has dealt a heavy blow to
Quebec's petrochemical industry. The East of Montreal suffered greatly.

more capital than ever, especially in the regions. A study by the National Research Institute
scientific (INRS) troubling conclusions formulated in 2002: while the border regions of the United States and Montreal-Quebec corridor had experienced positive impacts of the Agreement
free trade, regions, particularly the resource regions, had not been
able to reap the benefits.
It is urgent to link these regions to the rest of the continent with modern infrastructure and
effective in the field of transport as telecommunications so that they can
enjoy access to étrangers42 markets.

A sovereign Quebec that focuses on knowledge
In 2002, total spending on research and development in Quebec totaled 2.7%
of GDP. In comparison, total expenditures of Canada (including Quebec) research
and development totaled 1.9% of GDP, while, on average, spending on research
and development of OECD countries totaled 2.3% of GDP. This means that in this matter,
Canada lags Quebec down.
The sovereign Quebec will be able to give as objective included the first five ranks
OECD countries as to the level of public and private investment in research and
développement43.
Two factors in particular play on productivity in companies: the number of hours
worked and technological intensity. The Bloc Québécois believes that the increase in hours
working is an easy solution that does nothing to improve the quality of life of the population.
Given the importance of high technology content businesses, Québec will rather
give priority to knowledge.
The sovereign Quebec will be able to knowledge, research and development a priority
National and establish a sustainable support for research policy.
The Bloc Québécois suggests that this policy is based on the following:
•
•
•
•

maintaining greater access to post-secondary education;
a high and stable funding for universities;
an ambitious policy of recruiting foreign students, especially the third cycle;
sustained political funding of basic research, targeting
Quebec niches of excellence and plans 10 years, to allow
the culmination of medium- and long-term projects;
• a clear and sustained policy of fiscal support for research and development
businesses.

43 As a proportion of collective wealth, Sweden is currently the OECD country that spends the most on private and public research,

Ending inequities in federal spending on research and development
Investments in research and development (R & D) are also essential for growth, both in high-tech industries than in manufacturing and
transformation.
While Quebec represents 26.6% of total spending in Canada on R & D, it receives only
23.8% of federal funding in this area ($ 413 million) against 48.3% ($ 1.2 billion)
which goes to Ontario. This is a difference of $ 800 million. As for the research
directly by the federal government (intramural research), Quebec receives only 19.6%
Ontario and 57.7%. These are figures that speak volumes about the iniquity of federal spending
research and development.
Of the 122 federal research centers, only 17 are in Quebec (14%) against
48 in Ontario. Ottawa and its surroundings have 31 federal research centers, while
Gatineau has only one single (the Language Technologies Research Centre).
The Quebec government is trying the best he can to offset this inequity in
Federal research expenditures. Indeed, the Quebec government's efforts in R & D
account for 46% of all spending by Canadian provinces. He does
a force three times larger (in contributing 12.2% of R & D in Quebec) that
the Ontario government (4.1%).
Federal policies hinder Quebec. In Ontario, the federal government contributes about

Measures adapted to the Québec economy
Quebec's manufacturing base is different from the rest of Canada. Indeed, Quebec exports are dominated by the extremes of the spectrum of the export market:
• high-technology products such as telecommunications equipment,
aviation and aerospace, computer components, and pharmaceuticals;
• the low intensity technologique44 products such as aluminum and other materials
first, textiles and clothing, wood products, and furniture.
Together, these two classes of products represent more than 80% of Quebec exports
goods. Conversely, Canada, and this is especially true for Ontario, rather sells
Average product technology as miscellaneous manufactured goods, particularly automobiles. In medium-technology products account for nearly 70% of Ontario's exports of goods.
Traditionally, federal policies have been mainly focused on the needs of industry
Ontario. We saw this recently when the federal government has allocated $ 500 million for
help Ontario's auto industry. The Bloc Québécois believes it is important
to consider the needs of industrial sectors that are less present in Ontario and concentrated in Quebec.
In recent months, the Bloc Québécois argued the needs of high-industries
presenting a technology intensive aerospace policy and requesting a
significant improvement of federal policies related to research and development. From
Additionally, he proposed a package of measures to support the textile and clothing industries
hit hard by Asian competition.
It becomes urgent to develop measures adapted to low manufacturing sectors
technological intensity, which are concentrated in Quebec and among the most affected by the
Asian competition. In the absence of such measures, it is not surprising that the number
manufacturing jobs in Quebec has not increased over the past year.

Supporting industrial research
With almost a third of its exports related to high-technology goods, ahead of Quebec
all Canadian provinces. In terms of proportion of industry-related jobs
technology, the region of Montreal ranks third in North America.
Telecommunications, aircraft engines and aircraft parts are among the
top ten of Quebec exports. Quebec has risen to the 6th world rank
for the sales generated by the aerospace sector. Montreal is the fourth nordaméricaine city for jobs in the pharmaceutical industry.

Quebec receives its fair share, overall funding is clearly insufficient. In the last
budget, the federal government has announced an increase in spending on federal research centers, but they are concentrated in Ontario.
The Bloc Québécois calls for a substantial increase in federal investments
industrial research, in particular in the program that will succeed Partnership
Technology Canada.

A policy of aeronautical and aerospace
The Bloc Québécois has long been a real federal aerospace policy. Outraged
normal tax incentives, the policy must address the following objectives:
• a clear and predictable program to support research and development;
• a firm and predictable commitment to financing sales, particularly sales
export;
• a policy to support aerospace SMEs.

Why aerospace policy?
Aeronautics is a key sector. In 2003, it accounted for 75,000 direct jobs
Canada, almost half of the high-tech jobs and investments
research and development of a billion and sales of $ 21.3 billion.
Quebec is the leader in this field. With 40,000 jobs and deliveries over
$ 11 billion of which 89% are for export, represents Quebec's aerospace
55% of activity in Canada. These are quality jobs with annual average wage is
$ 56,000. Each year, the federal government receives tax revenue from this sector
valued at $ 2.1 billion.
In fall 2004, Bombardier, Pratt & Whitney and Bell Helicopter expressed their intention
to invest large sums in research and development to launch major projects.
The Bloc Québécois strongly supported their efforts to get the support of Ottawa.
Despite this, the lack of a clear federal policy has forced the holding of long negotiations and
painful. To end this uncertainty, the federal government must quickly create a
aerospace policy that includes specific financial commitments.

Support for research and development
Spending on research and development (R & D) averaging 2.26% of GDP in
OECD 2.49% among the G-7, but only 1.91% of GDP in Canada. An adjustment is necessary. In the US, the Pentagon is investing US $ 45 billion in R & D including some
$ 6.5 billion goes directly to Boeing, Raytheon and United Technologies. The aircraft program
Airbus A380 has access to US $ 3 billion in public funds from different European countries.

For its part, the Canadian industry as a whole was divided in 2001 amounting to
CAN $ 165 million provided by the federal government for R & D.
In addition to direct support, the federal government research center, the Institute
aerospace research, which is located in Ottawa rather than in the capital of Canada
aviation, Montreal.
The Bloc Québécois believes that this center should be moved to the Montreal area,
where industry is concentrated.

Technology Partnerships Canada
Develop a high-tech product is expensive and takes time. At this stage, the
Government funding is crucial. The primary federal program to aid research
Industry's Technology Partnerships Canada (TPC), created in 1996. TPC invests in Ottawa
research and development of the product and then when the cash royalties
product is marketed 5, 10 or 15 years later.
Currently, federal funding is unpredictable and on a case by case basis, with little
criteria. The industry suffers from this uncertainty. While the budget PTC remains constant, the
R & D needs of the aviation industry increased by 8% per year. This program is
So now underfunded. Moreover, the share of aviation in PTC decreased
during several years. Between 1996 and 2001, aviation accounted for 64% of TPC investments. This proportion fell to 36% in 2001-2002 and 29% in 2002-2003.
However, the 2004-2005 Expenditure PTC aeronautical recovered to 79.5% of total
while Quebec's share was 42%. The numerous interventions by the Bloc Québécois
this sense there are certainly no strangers.
The Minister of Industry announced on September 20, 2005, that he intended to dismantle
program to replace it by another and that would create an aerospace policy.
Since the announcement, nothing has been done. The Bloc Québécois is very concerned because this program is
nerve for the aviation industry. This behavior is itself irresponsible vis-à-vis the aviation industry and, more generally, leading sectors in Quebec.
The federal government must provide the aviation industry a stable, predictable and
high in R & D. The industry must rely on federal funding
(refundable) falling within a range of 20% to 30% of investment in R & D.
The Bloc Québécois will be very vigilant on this issue and it will ensure that support for
the aviation industry and other innovative industries is increased.

The financing of sales contracts
The federal government support for sales financing is much less than
that of other countries.

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

In the years 2001, 2002 and 2003 Export Development Canada (EDC), the federal agency that finances export contracts, financed on average 41% of deliveries
of Bombardier Regional Aircraft. In comparison, during the same period, the Bank
development of Brazil has financed over 80% of Embraer's deliveries.
Worse, the EDC Support decreased in 2003 to 37%. The majority of this funding
were for existing contracts, while Embraer last year received the support of the State
almost all of its funding.
This underfunding is particularly dramatic when many carriers
air are in crisis, lenders are reluctant to advance them the funds they need to
renew their fleet and that government funding is essential.
The federal government should establish a clear policy of product sales financing
Aeronautics and provide support comparable to that enjoyed by foreign companies enjoy
competitors. Such a policy should be predictable, so that the approval time
applications are significantly reduced. Recall that sales financing by EDC
is generally profitable for its shareholder, the federal government. In 2004, EDC said
surplus of $ 1.242 billion.

Support for SMEs
Of the 250 companies in the aerospace sector in Quebec, 240 are SMEs. They
represent 10% of total turnover of the industry, but they could do well
more.
To be certified supplier in the aerospace industry, SMEs must be able to be
associated with product development from the very beginning and to meet the requirements
quality and skills of the workforce in the promoter of a project.
These SMEs do not always have the means to meet those requirements or to participate
big events and fairs in the field and make themselves known. The government
federal government must support them and help them move from being a small business finance
precarious than medium enterprises willing to take the market by storm.
The Bloc Québécois proposes the following measures:
• substantially increase funding from NRC-PTC45 program, the PTC component
for SMEs, and create an envelope reserved for the aeronautics sector;
• establish a loan guarantee program to increase the working capital
businesses, enabling them to become more involved in product development and
bid for larger contracts;
• implement a program to support certification and accreditation of SMEs
with large corporations;

• implement measures to support the promotion and marketing abroad

Help traditional industries to face international competition: Example
of textile and clothing industry
When an industry is concentrated in Quebec, the federal government is dragging its feet
and the Quebec Liberals remain silent. The furniture industries, textiles and clothing
are good examples. Indeed, about half of the textile and garment industry of
Canada is in Quebec, where it provides nearly 100,000 direct jobs.
The textile and clothing deserve support as they go through a
crisis whose causes are beyond their control. While their presence in Quebec dates back to
more than a century, they are much more future businesses of the past. For example, the sector
Textile is one of the most innovative in Canada, it employs specialized labor and
productivity grew throughout the 1990s.
Past results are there to testify. In 1989, the textile and clothing sector
reacting to the entry into force of the free trade agreement. A few years later, the share
of the total Canadian production exported abroad had increased fivefold.
China is a competitor that must be taken seriously, however, do not give
arms, since there will always be opportunities: Canada occupies one percent
of clothing to the US market and each percentage point equals sales
$ 1.5 billion per year.
As such, the Quebec industry enjoys several advantages:
•
•
•
•
•
•

the proximity to the largest market in the world or the United States;
corporate concentration and skill in Montreal;
local industry prolific mode;
knowledge of North Americans needs;
technological advances;
a high speed to adapt to new trends.

There are many success stories. Outerwear manufacturers Kanuk,
Arc'teryx chlorophyll and chose, for example, to favor the path of technological development. While the Montreal company Doris Hosiery, she specializes in single
inventory management and the supply of nylons big box stores.
This industry needs help to adapt to a business environment that has changed
dramatically lately. The December 31, 2004, the Agreement on Textiles and
Clothing (ATC), in force since 1995, came to an end. This protectionist agreement, negotiated in the WTO, allowing developed countries to resort to bilateral quotas
to limit entry home textiles and clothes made abroad, a generally prohibited by the WTO process. The end of this agreement means that the boundaries of

68

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

Canada and Quebec will be more open to imports, including those of China
are growing rapidly.
Finally, the United States, the main market for Quebec exports, reached a
series of agreements that facilitate the entry into their territories of clothing made abroad
From American tissue, which diminishes access to clothes made from
textiles Quebec.
The result is that our industry is in crisis. The December 13, 2004, we announced the closure of six plants in the municipality of Huntingdon, eliminating 800 jobs and moving
70% of the working population of the municipality. On 1 February 2005, the manufacturer of clothing
and knits Gildan announced the closure of two factories and the loss of 285 jobs, including 115 to
Montreal. These closures are in addition to a host of other in recent years.
And it is not finished. Unless the federal government will soon present a plan
likely to help the industry adapt to the new trading environment, its survival is
threatened.
Unfortunately, Ottawa is dragging its feet. The few measures presented December 14
2004 AFTER the announcement of closures in Huntingdon, they are so insufficient in
almost insulting. In fact, it is only the continuation of existing programs, even those that did not stop the numerous job losses that have afflicted the
Quebec.
For its part, the Bloc Québécois has not remained idle. He presented a series of measures to promote the modernization, survival and development of the industry. February 8
2005, he led the House to condemn the lack of government action and ask the government to improve his assistance plan. Similarly, on October 5 was
adopted a Bloc Québécois motion requiring the government to "set up in the
compliance with international agreements, a policy of assistance to the textile and clothing industries
to enable stakeholders to meet the challenge of global competition. "
The House of Commons passed the motions of the Bloc Québécois and it is now
the government to implement them, it has still not done.
The Bloc Québécois proposes the following program of support to textile and industries
clothing.
Use the safeguards provided for in trade agreements:
• ensuring the maintenance of tariffs on imports of clothing and textiles;
• by introducing quotas on Chinese imports under the Access Protocol
China to the WTO.

The furniture industry
Québec expertise in the furniture field did not start yesterday. In 1871, there were already
56 furniture factories in Quebec.
Today, the Quebec furniture industry and related products employs approximately
25,000 people. In the field of residential furniture, Quebec is half of the
production and Canadian jobs. Montreal represents 19% of Quebec's production,
Montérégie 18%, the Chaudière-Appalaches and Centre du Québec 10% each.
Upon entry into force of the Free Trade Agreement with the United States (FTA), three quarters
furniture products in Canada were sold in the Canadian market. Also, there has been five
years the industry to adapt to the new trading environment and the Agreement did
applied gradually to the sector.

46 These rules are intended to help the least developed countries by ensuring that the true source of imports. For example, a product labeled
"Made in Bangladesh" may well have been made to 95% by China. Rules of origin are used to see from which genuinely
the merchandise.

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

The industry has risen to the challenge: between 1993 and 2002, deliveries of Canadian industries
residential furniture increased from 2 to over $ 5 billion and the number of jobs
doubled. Exports now account for 52% of production and 90% are for
in the USA. But now, the industry is facing a new challenge: foreign competition
especially Chinese.

The furniture industry is at a turning point
Between 2000 and 2004, Québec's imports of furniture and related products from
China surged 389.7%. They accounted for $ 192.8 million in 2004. This year,
42% of Quebec furniture imports came from China, compared to
16% in 2000.
Quebec exports have not compensated for Asian imports. On the contrary, between
2000 and 2004, they decreased by 4.1%, an average decrease of 1% per year. Sales
to the United States fell 4.4%, while US imports
Chinese furniture grew 120.3%.


A package of measures for the furniture industry
The onslaught of Asian competition they condemn the Quebec furniture industry? Not
at all! As she was able to do it fifteen years ago with the entry into force of the Free Trade Agreement with the United States, it may well adapt to China's accession to the Organization
World Trade.
All she needs is a boost to reorganize and some time
to achieve this.

Help plant modernization
While mass production sold cheap suffers the Asian onslaught, the furniture industry in Quebec has a distinct advantage over its Chinese competitors in terms of quality,
Design of concern to meet the tastes of consumers, ability to deliver production
quickly and accept custom orders.
In short, if it pursues the turn of quality and customer satisfaction, industry
Quebec could not only survive but grow. But this shift will require innovations
technological and better performing and more flexible equipment. In short, investment.
But after two very difficult years, Quebec companies do not necessarily have the resources to make these investments, more so than most
of them are SMEs.
The Bloc Québécois is asking the federal government to establish a program
support for the modernization and adaptation of the furniture industry. This program should
provide loans to businesses to adapt to the new trading environment
by modernizing their machinery and production techniques.
This program should also count a component promoting the development of new
materials and design.

Assist with marketing
The furniture industry has adapted to free trade with the United States and had until
Recently a remarkable growth in export sales.
But foreign competition is increasingly fierce and requires a redoubling of efforts
marketing. Make its products abroad and be present in the different
trade fairs is expensive. Moreover, the main furniture industry customers are
retail businesses, a sector that represents a risk for suppliers because
closures are numerous.
No less than 62% of furniture Québec businesses are small businesses
with fewer than 10 employees. For them, the costs and risks associated with business abroad
can be high, even prohibitive. The federal government, in charge of international trade, has a particular responsibility in this regard. The approximately $ 70,000 per year that
offers the industry through the Export Market Development Program are laughable.
The Bloc Québécois is asking the federal government to prepare a strategy for
the marketing of Canadian furniture, including incorporating a furniture component to its
promotional activities abroad and adapting programs offered by Export
Development Canada (EDC) to the needs of the furniture industry. The federal government
should also encourage the emergence of sales consortia, that is to say, the grouping
SMEs who market their products together to share costs.

Support the efforts of Quebec
Given the importance of the furniture industry in Québec, Québec devotes y
resources.
In the area of ​​training, there is since February 2005 Research Chair on
furniture at Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières, jointly funded by the Government of
Quebec and industry. Added to this are the various training programs at the college level
concern both the manufacturing design. The federal government, the resources
devotes are almost nil.
In the field of research and development, the Quebec furniture industry has
up the Investment Fund Innomeuble R & D and technology transfer. Moreover, it
participates in the furniture industry Research Partnership initiated by the Government of
Quebec, which also dedicates a part of the activities of the Industrial Research Centre of Quebec
(CRIQ) in the furniture industry.
The Bloc Québécois is asking the federal government to support government efforts
Quebec in research and training by increasing its transfers
postsecondary education.

Improving the taxation of private forests
Wood furniture represent slightly more than half of the production of enterprises
Quebec residential furniture. For them, a stable supply and good prices Wood
is particularly important. However, the taxation of private forests is inappropriate.
On the one hand, expenditure planning and planting of the forest are not deductible
tax for farmers whose wood covers only part of the earth. Furthermore, even
if a forest may take decades to grow, producers can not
stagger the income they derive, discouraging the planting of slower cash
push, including hardwood used in furniture. This causes an increase in production costs and discourage the planting of new hardwood forests.
The furniture industry suffers.
The Bloc Québécois is asking the federal government to change its tax rules
applicable to private forests.

Save the domestic market by temporarily protecting the cheap Asian imports
If the domestic market is devastated by the Asian imports before the industry has
completed her turn, she might be overwhelmed by the Asian tsunami.
On 31 October, the Canadian Council of Furniture Manufacturers (CCFM) filed a motion
with the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT) to demand an investigation into Chinese imports residential furniture. The Tribunal is expected to rule in January
and the federal government will be authorized to take measures to protect the industry.

The Bloc Québécois is asking the federal government to take, once the Tribunal
Canadian International Trade aura authorized, safeguard measures to protect
furniture industry of Chinese imports.

The example Bicycle Manufacturers
The Bloc Quebecois welcomed the judgment of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT)
allowing the federal government to enact safeguard measures for
cheap bicycle manufacturers. This battle was won so that the
Government can now move forward. However, it suffers pressures retailers
such as Canadian Tire and Wal Mart who oppose it. Hundreds of jobs are at stake in
Quebec.
The Bloc Québécois requires the federal government to move forward by imposing duties
Customs such as the CITT recommended.

Other sectors
During its next term, the Bloc Québécois will develop policies to
better support furniture industries, oleochemicals, maple syrup production, as well as political
for the promotion and the safe use of chrysotile, the image of the national policy
Quebec.
Government purchases
With the purchase of goods and services ranging between 40 and $ 50 billion per year, the federal government is the largest purchaser in Canada. Yet no law requires it to
give preference to suppliers from here.
Between 1998 and 2002, the government has made purchases of nearly $ 3 billion
abroad. If half of these purchases were made in Canada, more than 21 000
jobs / year have been created in Canada rather than abroad.
For example, in autumn 2003, the Bank of Canada decided to buy her a paper money
German supplier instead of the company Spexel Beauharnois. The company closed its
opened in April 2004, causing the loss of 100 jobs. Moreover, until recently,
Canadian stamps were printed in the United States.
Another example is the government withdrew this year's Canadian content requirements
in army boots, condemning the Tannery Creek in Saint-Pascal de Kamouraska.
The change in the rules of the contract awards of $ 7,000,000 has caused loss
50 jobs.
One of the biggest government buyers is the Ministry of Defence. In April 2004,
Government announced its intention to procure three huge multifunctional vessels:
a contract of $ 2.1 billion that could provide up to 1,200 jobs over 4 years from
2007. While this is the Davie engineers who developed it in the 1990s

concept of a multifunctional ship, nothing ensures that the Lévis shipyard gets the contract or
even he will not be granted to a foreign company.
The Bloc Québécois introduced a bill to force the government to focus on Quebec and Canadian suppliers whenever trade agreements allow.
In addition, the bill forced the government to allocate its purchases equitably between
provinces. For years, Ontario consistently gets its share of contracts
government, while Quebec gets less systematically.
The Bloc Québécois will reintroduce a bill to force the federal government
preferred suppliers by over foreign suppliers and distribute its purchases
more equitably among the provinces.

Shipyards
The Bloc Québécois has repeatedly proposed that Canada develop a genuine policy
Shipbuilding. This is all the more necessary that the defense policy, registered
in April 2005, reported the government's desire to develop new marine vessels.
Furthermore, the Bloc Québécois notes that European countries installed more wind
offshore on platforms, a bit like oil rigs. It
provides some very interesting contract to European shipyards. Finally, transport
World seaborne merchandise is steadily rising. The Bloc Québécois supports
that Quebec shipyards could benefit, too, of such a development.
The Bloc Québécois will return to the load by requiring that Canada develop a policy
shipbuilding and ensure that every decision of the government, either
defense, industry or another, take into account the possible benefits for
Quebec's shipbuilding industry.
The federal government has a large fleet of civilian ships and defense. The fleet
aging requires major refit. However, in recent years the Liberal government applies significant "transfer fees" when assessing proposals
shipyards that offer their service to inspect, repair or modernize the Canadian ship. These transfer costs represent the cost to move a ship from its home port
and the shipyard where the work will be done. However, like all military ships
East are located in Halifax, yards Maritime Provinces are systematically
privileged at the expense of Quebec sites.
Given that in terms of the federal government is responsible supply
twofold: promote regional development and get the best value for
taxpayers by ensuring that there is enough shipbuilders to ensure healthy
competition, the Bloc Québécois believes that in the name of fairness, the federal government should
review its policy on ship transfer fees.

Federal taxation threatens Quebec microbreweries
The Liberals, as we know, too often favor the interests of some friends of the regime
over those of the majority. The micro-breweries record, including the federal tax brakes
development to larger brewers, is one example.
In Canada, brewers pay an excise tax of 28 cents per liter, regardless of quantity
occurred. For microbreweries, this tax is often the difference between survival and
bankruptcy. It is no coincidence that 44% of micro-breweries have closed in Canada
Over the past five years and imported beers increased their market share
175%.
Small businesses in the brewing industry are distinct and should be taxed
accordingly, as do almost all industrialized countries including the United States.
The Bloc Québécois will continue to demand a reduction of the excise tax applicable
the first 75,000 hectoliters of beer produced by a small brewery (production less
300 000 hectoliters), making from 28 cents to 11 cents per liter.

Training the workforce
On the eve of the federal election of 1997, under repeated pressure from the Bloc Québécois, the
Quebec government and its social partners, Ottawa finally consented after a
Battle of 30 years to transfer Quebec's share of the sums he spent on training
Workforce. This commitment was partially denied, the federal government retaining
Large parts of the formation of labor, particularly as regards young people,
people with disabilities, immigrants and older workers.
The will of the federal government to maintain and even to interfere more in this
field manifested itself repeatedly. This is the case of the mini-budget
November 2005 electioneering that promised billions of dollars for programs
created specifically according to federal government objectives and nowhere does
mentions his intention to do so in accordance with the agreements already signed with Quebec.
The Bloc Quebecois demands that the federal government withdraws from the employment sector and
the training of the workforce, specifically in four areas in which it
continues to intervene and gives Quebec its share of federal funding devoted to it.

Older workers
The Adaptation Program for Older Workers (POWA), established in 1988, allowed
workers aged 55 to 64 who lost their jobs to benefit from a longer delivery period to bridge the gap to the benefit of the pension board. The program
was abolished by the Liberals in March 1997. In 1996, 11,700 persons were yet registered
the program after 900 layoffs.

No permanent program was established to compensate for the abolition of PATA and come
assistance to these workers who often have more geographic mobility or adaptability
to find a job quickly. Several recent closures of companies, resulting
hundreds of unemployed older workers who can ill reclassify warrant
Replacing such a program. This program should be managed as a social program
by the Quebec government and funded through an agreement comparable to training
of the workforce.
On June 9, the Bloc Québécois presented a House motion that the
government develop a strategy to help older workers who lose
their jobs, a strategy that should include provision for income support measures. Although
This motion was passed unanimously, but nothing has been done.
Once sovereign Quebec could create a program to help older workers, so
not to rush into poverty and allow those who have the possibility of returning
gradually the labor market.
The Bloc Québécois will continue to demand the establishment of an income support program for
older workers on the model of the old PATA.

For a Fair Globalization
The Bloc Québécois is in favor of open borders to international trade. The
Quebec, trading nation needs this access to the world without which our industries
advanced could not flourish.
In order for trade to be mutually beneficial, they must first
be fair. A trading system that produces exploitation in poor countries and
dumping in rich countries is not viable. We can not accept a free trade
which would result in a race to the bottom.
The absence of minimum rules on environmental or labor standards in
trade agreements puts enormous pressure on our industries, especially our
traditional industries. It is very difficult to compete with products manufactured in defiance
of the most elementary rules of social rights.
The Bloc Québécois believes that child labor or forced labor is a form
unfair competition, just as or even more than export subsidies
or dumping. We must have the means of protection against these practices. However, agreements
commercial and trade laws do not protect our businesses and
workers against this social dumping. If a country wants to enjoy the benefits of free trade, it
must in return accept a number of basic rules, notably in the area
social rights.

leading. Quebec, where industries threatened by Asian competition are
proportionately more present in Canada, is ahead in this debate.
The Bloc Québécois urges the federal government to revise its positions in the
trade negotiations to ensure to include in trade agreements
clauses providing for the respect of minimum standards in terms of labor law, respect
of human rights and the environment.
The Bloc Québécois considers Canada to be credible on this issue, should
quickly signed major conventions of the International Labour Organization against
discrimination, forced labor and child labor, for the right of association
and free negotiation.
We need the federal government to take steps to protect our jobs against the
commercial and social dumping. Some actions can be taken now. For example,
increase the resources of the Border Services Agency and the Canadian International Trade Tribunal
exterior to accelerate their operation more quickly and to counter unfair trade practices. If an investigation lasts two years, chances are great that our
workers are already on the street where a judgment is handed down.
Then you have to adapt the operation of these institutions to the current wave of relocations
who are in favor of a globalization without rules. Currently, trade laws
allow a company to file a petition to the Canadian International Trade Tribunal
if it is threatened by massive imports. But when it is itself the product
abroad in imported goods, it obviously will file no complaint.
Currently, workers who see their jobs move abroad are completely
powerless because Canadian trade laws are not adapted to this wave
relocations.
The Bloc Québécois request changes to Canadian trade laws to
allow workers to file petitions in Canadian International Trade Tribunal
outside. He has already filed a bill to that effect.

The weaknesses of the dispute settlement mechanism of NAFTA
The conclusion of the Free Trade Agreement with the United States in 1988 and its extension
Mexico by the conclusion of NAFTA in 1994 were to ensure that the Quebec companies
free access to the North American market. However, in light of the crisis in the softwood lumber drags on,
it is clear that the mechanisms of NAFTA are not enough to ensure the
compliance with the agreement within a reasonable time.

Oil companies have abused enough
For several years, the rise in oil prices helping, the profits of big companies
oil continue to break records. In addition, they benefit from streamlining their
refining operations to inflate prices at the pump, affecting the entire economy. So,
all citizens contribute, in spite of themselves, the huge profits of oil.
The plan of the Bloc Québécois
This finding is not new but the oil shock of September 2005 requires us to
realize that our strong dependence on oil becomes dangerous for the economy.
At that time, the Bloc Québécois was the first to suggest a comprehensive action plan with measures to help the most vulnerable consumers, to supervise and discipline
industry and to reduce our consumption of oil, either by saving
of energy, in favor of green energies.
Here is a summary of that plan.

Short term provide relief to consumers
• Establish a refundable tax credit to mitigate the effects of rising
petroleum products.
• Foster Oil Heat conversion.
• Establish a tax credit for public transit costs.
Assist affected economic sectors
• Establish a refundable tax credit for holders of a permit or driver
taxi owner.
• Establish a tax credit for independent truckers.
• To compensate farmers for losses incurred additional costs

• Increase the deduction for fuel costs independent forestry companies.

According to Statistics Canada, American companies control 44% of assets and 53% of
Operating income reported by the branch of the extraction of oil, gas and coal.
This means that most of the profits of the big oil companies is directed towards
United States. In addition, the oil industry is the source of almost all new issues of greenhouse gas in Canada since 1990.
The oil industry record profits, is the main source of growth

The Bloc Québécois, in agreement with the OECD, opposes this absurd gesture of
reward the oil industry. The federal government should do exactly the opposite and
impose a surtax on oil these excessive profits. This will also advantage
to tax the pollution generated by this industry.

Surtax on oil company profits
Besides the fact that this is a great way to rebalance the market in favor of consumers, the federal government can fund, out of the oil money, the measurement series
suggested by the Bloc Québécois to end the dependence on oil, to discipline the
industry and help, if any, the most vulnerable consumers.
The Bloc Québécois proposes an increase of the current surcharge for tax
companies. This surcharge would target only the oil and allow the federal government
to fetch close to $ 500 million per year.

Given the already high concentration of the banking sector in Canada, the Bloc Québécois
opposed any merger between the major Canadian banks, unless they make the

2.8 The social economy
Unprecedented growth
The social economy business sector has grown considerably since the eight
last years. In Quebec, this sector includes about 6,000 companies that operate
cooperative mode or with a non-profit organization status. They work in a crowd
areas of activity, and data are functioning democratic mechanisms.
In Quebec alone, an estimated 65,000 the number of jobs created by companies
social economy (excluding financial cooperatives, mutual insurance companies and
large agricultural cooperatives). Together they realized in 2001 a turnover
of $ 4.3 billion. They are found in a variety of sectors: the small centers
Children and domestic help, of course, but also the culture, community media,
environment, community housing, social tourism, adapted work centers, etc.
In addition to meeting many needs, the social economy has a positive impact on the
development of numerous communities in Quebec. Economically First, by allowing the creation of quality jobs that stimulate economic activity, especially in the regions. To
then socially, promoting collective entrepreneurship, access to quality services,
as well as democratic values ​​and citizenship.
Together with a host of organizations whose communities are equipped to make
support, these social enterprises embody the third sector seeking to
take his place between the private sector and the government sector.
The Quebec government recognizes and supports social economy since 1996, taking account,
in particular, its contribution in terms of job creation. This support has taken many forms,
but it was especially to promote the greatest possible financial independence for these
businesses, giving them access to sources of financing adapted to their reality.
From the 2004 budget, the federal government has just initiated the same process of recognition of the social economy that the Government of Quebec. Thus he announced
the granting of a $ 100 million across Canada ($ 30 million for Quebec)
to support the capitalization of social enterprises in the five
coming years.
The Bloc Québécois urges the federal government to reconsider its support programs
Economic concrete to make them accessible and adapted to the needs

$ 18 billion in 2003, up 40% compared to 1999 and providing employment to
77,000 Quebecers from all regions.
Now who says growth says need capital to support and this is the weakness of cooperatives. Because they do not make a profit and they distribute their surpluses to their members,
cooperative enterprises are often undercapitalized, which hinders their growth. The Quebec government has adopted tax measures to enable cooperatives to deal
this challenge. The federal government, it is still slow. The Bloc Québécois believes that the
cooperative institutions that operate private businesses differently, should be
subject to a tax system adapted to their reality and needs.
The Bloc Québécois will ask the federal government to draw on fiscal measures
Quebec applicable to cooperatives and insist on the adoption of two measures
encourage members and employees to invest in the capitalization of their cooperative:
the introduction of a tax deduction for investments in cooperatives and shares
the authorization of the tax deferral on patronage dividends that shareholders leave in
their cooperative.

CHAPTER III - THE QUÉBEC POPULATION
The main wealth of a nation, it is the human beings who compose it. Quebec
sovereign will adopt a human development policy. Such a policy allows
to set clear objectives and contains incalculable and lasting benefits in terms of dignity
human, prosperity and social integration.
This policy will be based on principles which are currently the subject of a broad consensus
in Quebec :
• ensure that all Quebecers quality education;
• halt maximum poverty and violence;
• ensure maximum integration of Quebecers in the company,
including through the education system, civic participation, gender and work;
• facilitate the reconciliation between work and family;
• ensure respect for human rights and the right to security.

Ensure a minimum and dignity of persons
Governments have a duty to go further than just creating conditions
economic and social development, they must also ensure that the entire
population has access to subsistence and dignity. In this respect, quality health services
accessible to all, a decent minimum income and housing are essential. Governments
also have a duty to support families, the elderly, immigration and nations
Indigenous. Governments must ensure justice for all. Above all, they must manage
public funds with integrity, serving the common good.
A vital challenge: demographics
Quebec's population is undergoing profound changes and will face in the coming
years, critical challenges for the future. The aging of the population and, in some
parts of Quebec, the demographic decline poses major challenges. This tendency
fragile social balance between generations and could harm the economic growth
Quebec. Items that will allow Quebec to meet that challenge are found mainly in family issues and immigration.
Curb the current trend
To curb the decline in population growth in Quebec, it will increase the rate of
birth and succeed in attracting a greater number of immigrants. This challenge is one of size. For which
is the birth rate, the Quebec government has implemented over the years a family policy
integrated. This however was not able to bear fruit, having multiplied Ottawa
obstacles to its implementation. The conclusion of an agreement on parental leave after ten years
effort eliminates a major obstacle, but it is still work, including taxation level
related to child care. In terms of immigration, the only way for Quebec
to establish a real effective policy is to become a sovereign country. However, a
number of elements could help to improve the situation now.

3.1 A demographic and political weight in decline
Quebec faces the challenge of declining population growth and, in some
regions, an exodus. These challenges, the people of Quebec will raise only if
to control its finances, its laws and its international relations. Currently, the relative demographic decline, the fiscal imbalance and the lack of control of its immigration are
barriers that do not allow Quebec to fully meet the challenge of the population.
The relative weight of Quebec within Canada announced a loss of influence in marked
Canada as a whole. Indeed, Quebec's population increased from 28.8% of all
Canada in 1961 to 23.6% in 2003. It will be only 20.6% in 2026.

3.2 Young families
It would be unrealistic to expect a sudden and large-scale birth rate in Quebec
in the years to come. Time family of twelve children is over. But it would be
as futile to consider the current birth rate as inevitable. It is possible to allow some couples to start a family and others to host one or two children
more and providing opportunities to better balance work and family and supporting
more financially.
Quebec would already has long been a much more advantageous family policy
if it were a sovereign country. The federal government has delayed effect of creating almost ten years
Quebec parental leave program stubbornly refusing to negotiate with Quebec.
Similarly, by refusing to adapt its taxation in Quebec day care program, he confiscated
Quebec nearly $ 1.5 billion since 1998. This decision to Ottawa continue to curb political
Family of Quebec.
As he had promised during the last election campaign, the Bloc Québécois has exercised
lot of pressure and has stepped up interventions to address issues related to holidays
parental and child care. His efforts bore fruit. But there is still work to do.

Daycares
Currently, the biggest obstacle to family policy in Quebec, it is the government
Federal. The most important obstacles posed by Ottawa in Quebec, the fiscal imbalance.
By depriving the Government of Quebec of critical financial resources to meet the
needs of Quebecers, Ottawa induced pressure on all programs
Social Quebec, including the child care program to $ 5, which now cost $ 7 per day.
Worse, by refusing to adapt its tax to the Quebec child care program to $ 7, the
Federal government confiscated the Quebec parents almost 1.5 billion $ 48 since 1998.
In 2005, the Liberal government has seized at least $ 250 million to Quebec parents,
an average of $ 1,316 per child. Thus if nothing changes, in five years, Ottawa
has confiscated an average sum of $ 6,579 to parents in Quebec. Far from encouraging the progressive policies of Quebec, the behavior of the Minister of Finance at the time, Paul
Martin, Quebec penalized for having created a single child care program
North America.
The Bloc Québécois and its partners have been demanding for years that the federal government
transfer to the Quebec government the money it saves on the backs of Quebec families. This transfer will allow the Quebec government to invest in its family policy.

48 $ 1.479 billion precisely.

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

The Bloc Québécois will continue to demand that the federal government transfers to the
Quebec government the money it saves through the Quebec program
child care to low prix49.

Right to withdraw with full compensation
During the last election campaign, the federal government promised that it would invest $ 5 billion over five years for the establishment of a pan-Canadian child care system. The budget
2005 reiterates this announcement and plans to make available immediately to Quebec and
provinces $ 700 million ($ 165 million for Quebec) so that they can improve
their child care system "in accordance with the following principles: quality, universal inclusiveness, accessibility
and development "50. It took a long battle of 16 months for the Liberal government
finally understands common sense and agrees not require conditions in Quebec.
The Bloc Québécois has represented and successfully defended the consensus of the Assembly which nationale51
demanded the right to withdraw with full compensation for Quebec and without condition.

Family taxation
Currently, the Canadian tax has no universal measure that recognizes and takes into
specifically into account the responsibilities of parents with dependent children.
Remember that the Canadian Child Tax Benefit, the federal government
is very proud, is not a universal measure. It targets the more income families
modest, since its main objectives are the reduction of child poverty.
For example, the basic benefit amount, which despite its name is quite an allowance,
gradually decreases from the time the net family income barely exceeds the annual threshold
of $ 35,000.
Of course, the Bloc Québécois has always called for the implementation of measures aimed a
better distribution of wealth and poverty eradication. But considers that the
federal government should also review its tax system to make it more generous to
respect of all families with dependent children.
Among developed countries, the Canadian federal government is practically the only one that deals
tax certain families with dependent children in the same way that identical families
no children.

For example, in the G 7 countries, France, the UK and Japan offer their families
with dependent children universal forms of support. Among the OECD countries include
Also Germany, the Scandinavian countries, Belgium, Austria, the Netherlands and Ireland. In
Indeed, most countries of the European Union continue, in one form or another,
a universal system of assistance for children charge52.
The Bloc Québécois, it is obvious that the responsibility of setting up a family policy
complete up to the government of Quebec, the federal government can and should make an effort
additional tax in order to leave more money in the pockets of parents.
This is why the Bloc Québécois proposes a refundable tax credit for families
with dependent children under 18 years. The Canadian tax system should recognize the scale
responsibilities and costs involved in maintenance of children for all families, there
including those of the middle class, adopting the universal measure.
The Bloc Québécois proposes to gradually introduce a refundable tax credit
all families with dependent children under 18 years.

The abolition of GST on diapers and products for newborns
The Bloc Québécois believes that the federal government must do all it can to support
young families. Thus he filed a bill (C-305) providing for the abolition of the
GST on diapers and products for newborns.
The Bloc Québécois is committed to refile a bill providing for the abolition of
GST on diapers and products for newborns.

3.3 Citizenship and French language
The last sovereign French language
Quebec citizenship is based on diversity. It has as an anchor French,
common public language of Quebecers. This is the main element that bases
Quebec's distinctiveness.
However, this Quebec citizenship will remain fragile as long as it will compete with the
Canadian citizenship, which itself is based on the existence of a sovereign country, only capable of giving
legal citizenship as internationally and domestic.
The French language is also in a permanent state of fragility because if substantial progress
have allowed and supported to strengthen its presence in Quebec, there are indications
the situation remains precarious. Although opinions remain divided as to the situation of
French, the language transfers show that English remains very attractive force
present with newcomers. The following table shows progress but
also the precarious situation of French in Quebec.

This fragility is due not only because francophones are at the heart of a continent
English massively but also because Quebec legislation, which support and protect
our language, are constantly called into question, especially since the repatriation of
Canadian Constitution; a law adopted by another people, and that the National Assembly has always
refused to endorse.
Moreover, Ottawa constantly uses its immigration powers to try to
ensure that newcomers integrate into Canadian nation rather than nation
Quebec, when he does not try to use them squarely in partisan fights like
it did in 1995.

Finally legally establish Quebec citizenship in Quebec and in the
world, it will make Quebec a sovereign country. Similarly, as long as the status of the language
French laws and will be subject to the whim of another overwhelmingly English-speaking people, it will remain fragile. Until then, it is imperative that the French do not retreat in Quebec.
The Bloc Québécois is committed to remain vigilant vis-à-vis all policies
Federal Government that may affect the place of French in Quebec.

Francophone and Acadian communities in Canada
The Francophone and Acadian communities in Canada are many: all now have
their own color and identity. Thus now we speak of Franco-Ontarians, the
Acadians, Fransaskois, francophones in British Columbia, etc. Like Quebec,
They reflect the cultural diversity of the continent and ensure the presence of language and
the French culture in America. Maintaining a vibrant North American francophonie
important for Quebec.
The Bloc Québécois believes it is necessary to establish a true partnership between Quebec and communities
Francophone and Acadian. His policy, entitled Francophones of America: the time to act was
released in 1994 in Shediac. It focuses on the development of Francophone and Acadian Communities of Canada. At its unveiling, we have committed to
support communities and we have kept our word.
Recognizing the importance of Bill S-3 for Francophone communities in the middle
minority, the Bloc Quebecois has proposed amendments in order to preserve the draft
law in its current form for francophone and Acadian communities, while limiting its
territorial scope to ensure that the new requirements of the Act does not apply
in Quebec. Unfortunately, our amendments were not retained.
Nevertheless, the Bloc Québécois raises issues of Francophone communities
and Acadian House. We are sensitive to their concerns to the Joint Committee
on official languages. Note that, over ten years after the publication of the policy
Bloc Quebecois, the federal government, it still has no policy toward francophones
from Canada.
By then, the axiom of the federal government to the effect that the French and English languages ​​occupy
an equal place in Canada is misleading. In doing so, the federal government refuses to recognize the specific conditions under which evolves the French on the continent and wrongs
Historical incurred by Canadian francophones. By not recognizing that English is not
no threat to Canada, he denies reality.
Finally, the Bloc Québécois believes that the simple logic requires that the federal government recognizes Quebec's status as the only francophone state in North America and its right
strict adopt all the measures it considers essential to the defense and promotion of French in its territory and abroad.

The place of French in the federal
Although the French language remains the anchor of Quebec citizenship, it is also
in a permanent state of fragility in Canada. In an interview on RDI, August 10th, 2000, the Commissioner of Official Languages ​​indicated that "[...] must recognize that Quebec - which is home
Senior Canadian Francophonie - is still a minority within the federation
Canada then [he] is a certain asymmetry. "That is why the Bloc Québécois has always
committed to playing a leading role in the area of ​​official languages. The Bloc Québécois for
main objectives to resolve chronic problems that exist within the public service
Federal and improve the situation of French in international institutions.
The Bloc Québécois filed two complaints with the Commissioner of Official Languages
all against the Ministry of Defence and the Treasury Board, because they
systematically violate the Official Languages ​​Act.
The Bloc Québécois will continue to fight against flagrant breaches of the Department of
Defence and Treasury Board in terms of respect of the Official Languages ​​Act.
It is wrong to say that we can work in French in the federal government. When a manager
is unilingual English, all employees working under its authority in English. However, most of
35 years after the adoption of the Official Languages ​​Act, Ottawa still does not consider
Bilingualism required for a bilingual position. In a special study on the subject
published in March 2004, the Commissioner of Official Languages ​​stated that "non-staffing
imperative is still used to hiring managers at the entry level (EX 01). This
shortcoming is corrected since incumbents at that level account for about half of all
senior category. "
The Bloc Québécois denounces the laxity of the federal government over the situation of French
in the public service and requires immediate government that applicants for
designated bilingual meet, right from their employment, language requirements
the coveted position.

Support for Francophone communities
The Francophone and Acadian communities have with organizations that support and
represent them. These organizations are financially supported by the federal government. Gold,
agreements between Ottawa and communities are due and the amounts allocated to them
are insufficient. The Bloc Québécois had made the settlement of this issue one of its eight
budget priorities. Unfortunately, the 2005 budget provides no additional money for Francophone communities.
The Bloc Québécois is committed to hound the federal government to increase its
support to francophone and Acadian communities.

The Bloc Québécois will continue to play an important role in the international Francophonie. It intends to promote the increased use of French in the different
international institutions like the UN and the WTO, especially by sensitizing countries
members of the International Francophone Organization.
The Bloc Québécois is committed to promoting the increased use of French within
various international institutions.

The fate of French at Air Canada and in air transport
The Bloc Québécois is concerned about the place of French in air transport. Rights
language users are too often violated and Francophone workers
disadvantaged in this industry where liberalization announced not bode well.
April 1, 2003, Air Canada was placed under the protection of the Arrangement Act with
Creditors. Eighteen months later, September 30, 2004, the air carrier
found its wings following major changes to its structure.
The Bloc Québécois was then cared for compliance with the Official Languages ​​Act by the
"New" company that, in the past, has ceased to be the subject of a high number of complaints
concerning breaches of its linguistic obligations.
Bill C-47, to ensure that Air Canada would not benefit from its new structure
to escape its obligations, was under consideration but died on the order paper.
The Bloc Québécois is committed to ensure that this bill is reintroduced, enhanced
and adopted. It is also committed to promoting greater use of French in
air transport.

3.4 Immigration
A sovereign immigration policy, ambitious and human
Quebec has always been a land of immigration. Over the last thirty years,
we experienced an increase in migratory movements, a phenomenon that has encouraged
an ever greater openness of the population to ethnocultural diversity that we
Now consider a full component of the Quebec nation.
Quebec currently has an agreement with the federal government that ensures some
Immigration autonomy, allowing him to select about half of the immigrants who settle in its territory. As part of this agreement, Quebec selects
between 15,000 and 20,000 immigrants each year.
Unfortunately, the current agreement does not allow us to implement all
values ​​that characterize Quebec. Indeed, the federal government continues to dictate the
principles that guide family reunification and asylum claims, often creating untenable situations for people who are threatened with dismissal or who have to live on
years separated from their families.
The sovereign Quebec will base its immigration policy on its reception and traditions
humanism, with the following objectives:
• ensuring human dignity by reaffirming the right of families to remain united in implementing fast and efficient family reunification measures, and advocating
minimal use of removal orders, particularly with respect to
young offenders;
• ensure timely and objective treatment of asylum applications;
• support the installation and integration of immigrants and refugees in the region so that they
can participate in the challenge of regional development;
• granted the right to explore for asylum seekers.
Only the capacity of sovereign countries will enable Québec to deploy an immigration policy and host of ambitious and effective refugees. The limited visibility of Quebec
internationally ensures that potential immigrants too often ignore the
opportunities offered by Québec. The conferred means, for example, by a diplomatic apparatus, with its network of embassies and consulates, can make all the difference between a
flawed immigration policy and policy that manages to achieve its objectives.
When the first immigrants will give Quebec citizenship, many prejudices
integration and misunderstandings that we face today will disappear. Indeed, the
Quebec's vision of citizenship is not based only on legal status but includes
as a broad social vision.

The failures of federal immigration policy
Although progress has been made on immigration, the federal government could
demonstrate greater efficiency and more openness in recruitment
immigrant and refugee reception.
Under the Canada-Quebec Agreement in 1991, Québec is solely responsible for the selection
independent immigrants - workers and business people - the selection of
refugees abroad as well as the reception and integration of immigrants on its territory.
However, once a candidate is selected by Quebec, the request is routed
treatment for Canadian visa service concerned when the times are long and procedures
tedious. This situation discourages many skilled immigrants to continue their efforts
and deprives Quebec of their contribution.
Another problem affects people applying for refugee status once they arrive in
Canadian soil. During all the time - that reaches more than a year in certain cases - where an applicant
refugee expects that its application be considered by federal agencies, government
Quebec supports the applicants. Québec ensures that those persons
decent living conditions until their status is determined. The Government of
Quebec must be able to have sufficient funds to provide adequate services to
claimants throughout the expectation that sometimes extends over many months.
The Bloc Québécois is determined to get the federal government a significant improvement
the effectiveness of CIC in processing refugee claims,
without sacrificing the quality of processing of these applications, and an additional transfer
$ 100 million annually to support the efforts of Quebec.

Canada gets tough
The Bloc Québécois denounced the hardening of the federal approach at the expense of the rights of
refugees. Current gaps are increasing the degree of arbitrariness in the determination system
Refugee.
Before and after the attacks of September 11, 2001, voices were raised to tightening
the rules surrounding the determination of refugee status. In the Declaration on the border
Smart signed with the United States [a global agreement on border management], we want to indicate
harmonizing immigration policies and determination of refugee status.
The Bloc Québécois also condemns the refusal of Ottawa to establish a mechanism
Call for Refugees and the signing of the safe third country. by virtue of
This agreement between the United States and Canada and implemented 29 December 2004,
The asylum seekers arriving at border posts are expected to seek asylum in the first
safe country they set foot. With few exceptions, asylum seekers who have transited
by the United States and presenting to the Canadian border will be able to see their request
asylum heard by the Immigration and Refugee Board.

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

The Bloc Québécois is concerned that this Agreement does not create situations where refugees' safety is
questioned. All measures taken in the name of the new security obsession
Canada may significantly slow down the processing of applications and reduce the number
of refugees hosted in Canada and Quebec each year.
The Bloc Québécois intends to redouble its vigilance as regards reception of refugees procedures
in Canada to protect their rights and increase their numbers. The Bloc Québécois will ensure that
the federal government follow the recommendations of the United Nations High Commissioner
for refugees who participate in the periodic revision of the Agreement on safe third countries.

Refugee Appeal Division
During the adoption of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, Committee members
managed to get a fair and equitable process for asylum seekers is set
up through the creation of the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD). However, during entry into
force of the law, June 28, 2002, the Minister suspended the SAR. The Office of Nations
United for Refugees also criticized Canada on this point.
The minister at the time, Denis Coderre, pledged eventually to reinsert to offer
asylum seekers the right to appeal consistent with Canada's international obligations
protection of refugees, but his successor has turned around in November
2005 and a formal refusal opposed to the establishment of the appeal mechanism. The same government
Yet indicated in 2002 that the creation of an appeal division was a matter of justice and
fairness for asylum seekers.
As there are often matters of life or death, it is essential that the government
respects the laws and to put in place what is already provided for in the Act or the
Refugee Appeal Division.
The Bloc Québécois demands the implementation of the Refugee Appeal Division, as foreseen in
the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act adopted in June 2002.
These measures should increase the number of immigrants and refugees who settle
Quebec every year. Combined with an increase in the number of births, new contribution
population will correct, at least in part, insufficient growth. But first
Instead, the duty of the Bloc Québécois is to ensure that immigrants and refugees are treated with
dignity and fairness by Canada.

Security certificates
Security certificates allow the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)
to deport an individual who is not a Canadian citizen, to hold it for an unlimited period without
any charges against him, to impose the burden of proof while
preventing him from having access to all the evidence against him and not giving him
the right to appeal the decision.

Highly publicized cases have highlighted the deficiencies of the current system of security certificates,
including the possibility of arrest without warrant a person who is not a citizen, that the
burden of proof is on the accused and the dual role of judge who must be both the referee
and counsel for the defense.
Given these findings, the Bloc Québécois considers it urgent to overhaul the mechanism
security certificate to restore balance between the interests of the state and those of individuals.
The Bloc Québécois wants to find solutions to ensure the security of citizens without
perpetuating these violations to fundamental rights and freedoms which are the foundation of a
democratic society. It is particularly to end the indefinite detention and ensure that individuals are not deported to countries that practice torture.
As part of the revision of the Anti-Terrorism Act by the Subcommittee on Public Safety
and nationally, the Bloc Québécois will ask:
• that the article be amended the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (82 (2)) that
provides that foreigners can be arrested without warrant;
• a right of appeal is provided for in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act for

• the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act be amended to allow a
lawyer who obtained a security clearance to defend the rights of the accused during the
hearings on secret evidence.

Foster the regionalization of immigration53
While the proportion of Quebecers from immigrant increases continuously, the immigrant population settling outside major centers remains marginal.
Yet more than 20% of immigrants to Quebec come from rural areas in their country
original.
It is not enough for urban and rural Quebec to see the lack of succession,
labor and investment, and to affirm their desire to fill these gaps by, among
others resources from immigration. Must still register these wishes in a
realistic and integrated development approach.
Only the Quebec government is able to implement such a policy. He is
responsible for welcoming immigrants and a host of other areas likely to favor
establishment in their region, be it education and training, most of
utilities or almost all issues relating to regional development. The
Quebec government has already identified the regionalization of immigration as a
priority.

Immigrant investors
The Quebec Immigrant Investor Program, established in 1986, is a success
annually creates about 1,100 new jobs and increase domestic income Quebec
$ 85 million. According to a study by economist Pierre Fortin, although less than 20% of immigrants
Canadian investors are based in Québec, Québec has attracted nearly 50% of their
investments. The Quebec government playing a more active role that provincial governments
Canadian, it is better able to accommodate and direct capital investor immigrants,
thanks to the expertise of Investissement Québec.
However, changes to federal rules threaten that success. To be eligible,
the immigrant investor must invest now in the province where he settled, which could
reduce investments in Quebec over 50%.
The Bloc Québécois will require that the federal government restore normal competition
the different provinces of programs for immigrant investors.

Homemakers resident
A live-in caregiver takes care of children, elderly and disabled people in a private home. After working two years as a homemaker, she can
apply for permanent resident status in Canada. In recent years, it is
became clear that this program allows abuses that amount to slavery by not
not protecting caregivers against abuse by employers. Although the government has
held consultations, the actions are still pending.
Just as the various immigration stakeholders and rights protection

protect the rights of live-in caregivers.

Recognition of foreign credentials
In recent years, the federal government is trying to interfere in the issue of
recognition of newcomers' qualifications acquired in their country of origin. During the
February 2005 Budget and Economic and Fiscal Update of November 2005, the government even announced sums for this purpose. Making newcomers
can fully participate in society, including at the professional level, is a strong objective
commendable.
The trouble is that it is not in Ottawa to do so. The federal government has no jurisdiction
on issues related to education. It has neither the capacity nor the power, nor the experience required

3.5 Dignity for seniors
In recent years, the Bloc Québécois found that seniors are among the members
in our society who have been most affected by the cuts that Paul Martin has made in
transfer payments. The quality of life of seniors often depends care
they can receive. This quality of life also depends on their income.
That is why the Bloc Québécois strongly denounced irregularities
Federal Program Guaranteed Income Supplement, which provides extra money to
elderly people with low incomes. The negligence of the Liberal government in the management of the program
Guaranteed Income Supplement was such that in 2001, more than 68,000 seniors in Quebec, among
those who need it most, were still without income up to
$ 6,600 per year.
A huge operation put in place by the Bloc Québécois has so far helped find
approximately 42,000 of these people, many of whom were deprived of the sums owed their
be paid during the years under the federal program of guaranteed income supplement.
This effort represents about $ 190 million more, redistributed to the most deprived persons
of our society.
Nevertheless, older people who have been cheated by the federal government must
be repaid.
The Bloc Québécois therefore intends to continue its efforts to ensure that people
elderly, which is their right, receiving the guaranteed income supplement and the government
refund the $ 3.2 billion he has stolen them in recent years.

Adapting to population aging
The Bloc Québécois is committed to the vision of the Quebec Office of the International Year for People
Seniors who wrote in his report in 1999:
"It also emphasizes the economic burden increasingly heavy as the elderly are
weigh on generations that follow ... We forget to say simultaneously that people more
Seniors are an irreplaceable heritage economically, but also
cultural and social; they have contributed for many years to the development of
society through their work, their family, their taxes or their savings, accumulating them
share of social rights (p.11). "
We must now develop retirement as a new period of life that the average length
will soon exceed that of the professional career. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the
living conditions and social inclusion of older enable those who wish
to invest their retirement years in socially useful commitments.

Seniors' concerns echo those of other age categories, often with a stronger sense of urgency. Concerns about health, social housing, transport
and poverty are eloquent examples. Seniors are very concerned about poverty
As in younger than in older ones. The role of the state is also part of their concerns and best understood when you know that in 2001, 61.5% of seniors
alone for the majority of women were living below the low income threshold. No less than 57%
Seniors income from government programs, or the Old Age Security
and the Guaranteed Income Supplement. The duty of the Bloc Québécois is to ensure that people
Seniors are protected against poverty.
In this regard, the Bloc Québécois will ensure that old age pensions and Supplement
guaranteed income continue to be fully indexed to the cost of living and
specific realities of older people.
Furthermore, the adaptation of government departments and Crown corporations, as Post
Canada, the aging population is an important issue. Bureaucratic nitpicking and vision
the Liberal government harms hundreds of thousands of citizens and older citizens
their right to quality services. The case of GIS is the best known and
the most outrageous. But do not forget many other gaps that must be denounced
and corrected.

3.6 Indigenous Nations of Quebec
The Bloc Québécois recognizes indigenous peoples as distinct peoples with a right to
their cultures, their languages, their customs and traditions and their right to steer themselves the development of this identity. It thus complies with the orientation traced by René
Lévesque, a strong advocate of indigenous peoples, which has made Quebec the first State
America to recognize in it the aboriginal nations.
It is in this context that the Bloc Québécois, during a meeting of the Working Group
the draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, held in the month of
September 2004 in Geneva, supported the approach for recognition of their right to self-determination by the United Nations. This is based on the recognition of rights
collective and individual Aboriginal, exercise their right to self-government,
the recognition of their land rights and partnership for development
Future ancestral territories.

Establishing a real partnership with indigenous nations
The Quebecers can be proud of recent developments in relations
First Nations of Quebec. Since 1985, Quebec formally recognizes their existence.
This mutual recognition has been reflected by the Paix des Braves, a realization
mark a significant milestone. But Ottawa still slow to negotiate with a Cree
similar agreement in the areas under its jurisdiction. With each passing day, inaction
the federal government increases the risk that the Aboriginal nations are impatient and abandon
the path of dialogue in favor of legal action.
The Bloc Québécois believes that the future is not in the sterile opposition but rather in the
constructive and respectful partnership legitimate interests. And the Paix des Braves
the Marshall decision of the Supreme Court of Canada are all manifestations of the need
to intensify the dialogue with indigenous peoples and the many benefits that result.
Quebec chose a much more constructive approach. On February 7, 2002, the Government
Parti Québécois signed with the Grand Council of the Crees the agreement of the Paix des Braves
gives $ 3.5 billion to the Cree in 50 years, in exchange for abandoning prosecutions and
the development of James Bay. But for nearly three years, the Crees have put on the table
a comprehensive proposal for a regulation equivalent to Ottawa with the agreement they had concluded
with Quebec. The federal government needs to show good faith in the case and conclude
quickly an agreement that will satisfy the Crees of Quebec and will allow them to have all
the tools to govern themselves.

allowing it to advance the current debate, generate new ideas and to think about
outline of what could be a renewed relationship between peoples
indigenous and the people of Quebec.

recognizes the important contribution of indigenous peoples to Quebec society. This contribution is the

fundamentals of the collective identity of indigenous peoples, as well as the perpetuation of their
languages, is a legitimate concern that the Bloc Québécois fully agree.
To further improve the links with indigenous peoples, the Bloc Québécois has benefited
every opportunity to intensify the dialogue and step up meetings with them.
The Bloc Québécois is committed to continue its efforts to strengthen links between the peoples
indigenous and the Quebec people through promoting the establishment of a real partnership Nation

Royal Commission suites of Aboriginal Peoples Survey
After more than five years of work and consultations, the Royal Commission on
indigenous peoples, commonly called the Erasmus-Dussault Commission, in its report
published in 1996, traced the way for the emancipation of indigenous peoples. It proposed a
vast project spread over twenty years to achieve self-government.
The recommendations of the Commission were clear. He first had to repair the damage caused to indigenous peoples through the application of more than one hundred twenty-five years of retrograde Indian Act, dress wounds and support indigenous peoples in
realization of the inherent right of self-government in accordance with their customs,
their cultures, their languages ​​and their traditional institutions.

The socio-economic situation of indigenous peoples continues to deteriorate. Unemployment rate

youth suicide rate is twice that of young Quebecers. Polydrug
has a huge impact on young people's health. These facts and the problems of unhealthiness
hit the chronic housing molds are just some of the elements of the
dramatic problem faced by indigenous peoples, whose population they present the
highest growth rate in Quebec.
The Aboriginal housing conditions are among the worst in Canada. Despite some
improvements in recent years, the majority of households living on reserves
housing that does not meet the standards.
The Bloc Québécois deplores the lack of affordable housing size and quality
appropriate for Aboriginal people. Various medical and social problems have been linked to
poor housing and living conditions in many Aboriginal communities. Indeed,
overcrowded households have higher rates of respiratory infections, tuberculosis,
depression, family violence and alcohol and drug abuse.
Besides the housing, certain communities are living in conditions that resemble more
the Third - World North America only. The case of Kashechewan is a blatant illustration.
In this case, although the federal government aware of the situation since 2003, it took a
Ontario burst of action and the pressure of public opinion to act and finally brings
assistance to the Cree community.
The Algonquin community of Kitcisakik, located in the La Verendrye Wildlife Reserve,
knows too precarious conditions. The 386 people who live there have dwellings
summaries that have neither running water nor electricity. Yet for 20 years, the
community offers the federal government an innovative project to improve conditions
of life of its members.
The federal government must act immediately and take all necessary measures
Kitcisakik out the population living conditions and intolerable health.
Until the day when all Aboriginal nations realize their self-government
and equip themselves to economic and social development tools, it is the responsibility of
federal government, the trustee of indigenous peoples, to free up resources
adequate to overcome these serious problems. Despite the billions promised by Ottawa nothing
is set and the needs are immense.

agreements so as to achieve the desired results, the success of the implementation is gauged
with regard to the extent to which the obligations of all parties are respected.
However, as highlighted in a recent report of the Auditor General, the federal government

Innu nations of Mashteuiatsh, Betsiamites, Essipit and Nutashkuan.
The principles that should underpin such agreements are recognition of aboriginal rights
on all the territories of indigenous peoples and the recognition of their right to
self-government.

so as to establish with indigenous peoples a true partnership based on trust,
mutual respect and recognition of their rights. The Bloc Québécois also require

The right of indigenous women
Aboriginal women experience some acute problems because of the Indian Act and
management of different programs by the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs (INAC).

3.8 The employment insurance and labor laws
The financial resources that the federal government takes in taxes, duties and social contributions of Quebecers and Canadians must serve the common good and contribute to
redistribution of wealth. The Liberal government of Paul Martin is quite the opposite, everything
particularly employment insurance. This program is designed as insurance for
workers and that is why they are contributing. The federal government, however, continues to manage the surpluses as if they belonged to him. His reforms and labor laws
penalize workers, especially the self-employed, pregnant women,
young and foreign workers.

The Bloc Québécois has moved the file
At the outset, let us recall that during the last year, the Bloc Québécois has managed to
unanimously adopted by the Standing Committee on Human Resources, a
creating a commission report and a separate fund. The same report recommends
House of Commons a gradual repayment of $ 46 billion diverted from the fund.
The committee also adopted by majority a series of recommendations to improve the
EI regime.
Finally, the House voted by a majority in favor of a Bloc Québécois bill providing for the
creation of an independent fund and commission an independent employment insurance and
repayment of misappropriated $ 46 billion. The government has, once again, refused to hold
account the will of the House.

A Quebec employment insurance fund
The sovereign Quebec could create a Quebec fund and self employment insurance which
the programs will be adapted to the realities here. This Quebec fund will focus its
programs related to Emploi Québec, in order to maximize the participation more
in the labor market. Quebec's employment insurance fund will be endowed with a reserve
to deal with economic shocks without precipitating the government situation
deficit.
Respect for the law
In any country is the first duty of a government is to respect the laws that
has itself adopted. The second is not appropriate what does not belong. The
Liberal government of Paul Martin has violated these fundamental rules by capturing
surplus in the EI fund. This program is designed as insurance, so
only 46% of workers who pay into the employment insurance fund have access to
benefits when they lose their jobs. A private company would have done so today
bankrupt.
The Auditor General found that the accumulated surplus in the employment insurance fund
amounted to $ 46.2 billion in 2004. It also says the government has not respected
the spirit of the Employment Insurance Act by pillaging the surpluses year after year. Victims of
this misappropriation of funds are contributors to the fund, while paying private insurance.

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

Moreover, the EI system is not immune to a major economic shock since the
box is empty. The government has a moral duty to stop this shameless looting and refund
all it took to women workers and workers.
The Bloc Québécois demands that the federal government reimburses the employment insurance fund.
To do this, he proposes a repayment plan of the fund in order to improve the system
and to provide reasonable reserve in case of economic crisis.
The significant surplus in the employment insurance fund originated in cuts
made by the Liberal government. These cuts have had the effect of restricting
access of the unemployed for Employment Insurance benefits. Women, youth and workers
seasonal industries were the most affected by such liberal reforms.
To avoid that in the future the federal government arbitrarily sets the contribution rate
EI to generate surplus and that it dips into the box, create a box
self employment insurance. The Bloc Québécois has the support of unions and employers in Quebec,
as well as that of all opposition parties in the House of Commons. In addition,
December 14, 2004, the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills Development, Social Development and Persons with Disabilities unanimously
recommended the establishment of an independent employment insurance commission.
The Bloc Québécois demands the creation of an independent fund employment insurance and a
independent commission of responsible employment insurance, in particular, the fixing
the contribution rate.

Workers in seasonal industries: end the "black hole"
Workers who work in companies whose level of activity fluctuates with
seasons are numerous. They are found in the fishing industry, in the food industry in
tourism and hospitality, etc. Seasonal work is common in the regions, but also in
major centers, taking into account in particular the tourism industry.
Each year, many workers face the "black hole". This is the period,
up to twelve weeks, during which they are not entitled to any benefits.
According to federal data, nearly a third of EI beneficiaries go to the
limit of their weeks of benefits. Also, sometimes seasonal workers
do not complete enough weeks of work to qualify for employment insurance,
thus losing their entitlement to benefits. A majority of them will be left without income
a more or less long period.
In order to address the situation of seasonal workers, the Bloc Québécois offers
several measures including a single eligibility threshold of 360 hours and the increase
five weeks of the duration of benefits compared to the current situation.

Ending discrimination against young people and women
At the heart of the reforms they have implemented the Liberals imposed a clause that ensures
that new entrants to the labor market or those returning to it after a period of
two years - mostly women and young people - must accumulate 910 working heures57
before being eligible for employment insurance, while the accessibility threshold varies between 420 and
700 hours for other categories of workers.
This discriminatory clause has had the effect of preventing young people from having access to
EI. In the early 1990s, no less than 52% of unemployed under
25 years receiving employment insurance benefits. This fell to 16%, depending
a study by the Canadian Labour Congress.
The Bloc Québécois demands the abolition of the discriminatory clause that new
arrivants58 on the labor market must perform 910 hours of work before being
Eligible and requires a 360-hour eligibility threshold for all.

The women
Since the last amendments to the Employment Insurance program in 1996, the gap between
men and women who have access to the scheme has grown from 6% in 1996
to 11% in 2001. The reduction of women's eligibility due to two nature-related reasons
part-time work. Many part-time workers were doing everything
just not enough hours to qualify for employment insurance. Another reason is the
growth in the number of people working for non-scheduled hours hours. For example,
Nurses who work on call may have difficulty getting eligible. Given the
proportion of women in the labor market for part-time, they ended up paying
literally more for fewer benefits.
Foreign seasonal agricultural workers
Canada receives each year about 17 000 farm workers in Mexican majority. To
During 2002, the Quebec agricultural businesses hired more than 2,000 workers
Mexicans to work in the harvest. According to United Farm Workers of America (UFWA) perceived Ottawa
in 2000, $ 11 million in contributions to employment insurance to seasonal workers
foreigners and their employers, while these employees are not entitled to benefits because they
are not available to work in the winter.
The Bloc Québécois proposes that we amend the Employment Insurance Act so that workers
Foreign Agricultural be exempt from EI premiums as recommended
the Human Resources Committee in February 2005.

Self-employed
The self-employed now represent 16% of the active population, and their proportion
Within the labor market continues to grow. Yet they are not insurable under the law.
57 In Budget 2005, the federal government planned pilot projects bringing the total required 840 hours in the upper regions
unemployment rate.
58 The term "newcomers" includes people returning to the labor market after two years, a large number of women.

In February 2005, the HR Committee recommended that the federal government
envisages the creation of a framework for extending the application of the Employment Insurance program to
self-employed workers who so wish, on a voluntary basis. The Bloc Québécois joins
this recommendation.
The Bloc Québécois proposes to establish a system of voluntary participation in EI
for self-employed for both regular and special benefits.

Labor laws
In a sovereign Quebec, labor rights are the same for all Quebeckers
all Quebecers. Thus, all will have access to paid preventive leave and the use of
strikebreakers will be prohibited to all companies.
Quebec adopted an anti-strike law breakers in 1977, a measure that has enabled much more civilized labor relations. Today, this law is a consensus in Quebec. However,
25 years later, the federal government still refuses to pass such a law for workers
under federal jurisdiction. This has very important implications as evidenced by conflicts
work experienced by thousands of Vidéotron workers, Radio-Canada or Secur.
The Bloc Québécois proposed a strike anti-scab legislation in the House of Commons.
On election day, most Liberal members voted against the bill. Paul Martin, for
his part, was careful to be absent from the House for the vote, choosing to avoid
its parliamentary obligations in order not to display his true positions. All ministers
Quebec present voted against this bill. It is time to enact such legislation and to
end to a situation where there are two categories of workers in Quebec: those who have rights
under the Quebec Labour Code and those who do not have under the Canada Labour Code.
The Bloc Québécois will reintroduce a proposed strike anti-scab legislation in the House of
Public and return to the load so it will not be adopted.
Similarly, Quebec allows preventive withdrawal with compensation from the CSST for women
speakers. Federally, the preventive withdrawal is possible without compensation other than the employment insurance program and, again, on condition that the worker manages to qualify.
This puts mothers before a wrenching dilemma: either they withdraw to preserve their health
or their unborn child and they lose part or all of their salary or they
keep their salary risking their health or that of their baby. Finally, the worker who relies
preventive withdrawal under employment insurance risks exhausting its weeks of benefits,
which will deprive it of paid maternity leave to which she is entitled.
The Bloc Québécois has repeatedly proposed legislation which will allow Quebec
to have uniform rights and protection. It is time to adopt and end a
situation where there are two categories of workers in Quebec.

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

The Bloc Québécois will reintroduce a bill that will allow Quebec to have
uniform rights and protection in the event of preventive withdrawals.

Protection of workers in case of bankruptcy
As it had undertaken to do, the Bloc Québécois has intervened to correct the situation
current which is deficient and fully supported Bill C-55 which establishes the Program
wage protection, allowing workers to recover much of the
wages to which they are entitled when their employer goes bankrupt.
The Bloc Québécois will ensure, during the next parliamentary term, this program
be established.

Psychological Harassment in the Workplace
The federal government must adopt a law against psychological harassment in the
job if he wants to protect its staff and population potential abuse by executives,
Act as Quebec Labour Standards already provided. Such a measure
would end that, in an October 2003 report, the Auditor General qualified
a "reign of terror" in the wake of the Radwanski affair.
The Bloc Québécois has also tabled a bill to this effect on April 7, 2005. Despite this,
October 5, 2005, the Liberals have once again demonstrated that they do not care about the fate of
workers' by rejecting the bill the Bloc Québécois which aimed to come
assistance to victims of psychological harassment within the public service and to those
governed by the Canada Labour Code.
The Bloc Québécois is committed to reintroduce a bill that helps
mobbing victims who work within the public service
and those governed by the Canada Labour Code.

Pay Equity
In Quebec, the Pay Equity Act corrects since 1996, within the same company,
differences in compensation due to discrimination based on sex in respect of persons occupying
jobs in job classes predominantly female. This law affects all
Quebec except those under the Canada Labour Code.
Although section 11 of the Canadian Human Rights provides that the employer
practice in wages between men and women performing work of equal value
in the same establishment commits a discriminatory act, the wage gap still exists
between men and women at the federal level.
The Bloc Québécois calls for replacing the existing model based pay equity
complaints by a separate new, proactive legislation on pay equity that would
pay equity a fundamental human right in accordance with what is in Quebec.

3.9 Social housing
Housing rights, dignity question
Each person has the right to housing. This is an essential element of human dignity.
The disengagement of the Liberal government funding of social housing in Canada,
from 1994 to 2002, was originally a serious housing crisis in almost all cities
Quebec and Canada.
We find vacancy rate for private rental housing from 1.1% in Quebec to 0.9%
Sherbrooke, Montreal 1.5% and 2.1% in Gatineau, which is well below the equilibrium rate
generally recognized by 3%. This crisis has not yet resolved and it is time that the federal government assumes its share of financial responsibility and creates a substantial investment plan.
In the 2005 federal budget, the Liberal government has absolutely nothing planned for residential area. Not a penny, as he promised in his election platform in 2004 to invest between
1 and $ 1.5 billion over five years in social and affordable housing. Although the government has
promised a sum of $ 1.6 billion in the last budget, we still do not see the
of that money.
The Bloc Québécois called for a gradual reinvestment of the federal government,
achieve a goal of nearly $ 2 billion investment per year in housing
social and affordable - the equivalent of 1% of its spending programs. These
are, Quebec's share will be transferred unconditionally to the Quebec government.
Since 2002, the federal government has invested $ billion in a housing program
affordable. As part of the first phase of this program, the Government of Québec
obtained $ 161 million and control of projects implemented. A second phase of the program,
announced in Budget 2003, included $ 320 million for all of Canada. He will have
took more than a year before the federal government finally releases the money and deliver
Quebec $ 75 million in April 2004.

Excessive surplus CMHC
Pending action by the federal government in this matter, the Bloc Québécois
went ahead by filing a bill to limit the capitalization capacity
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) and reinvested profits
Retained rather than capitalize them automatically, while the need is acute. The project
law will limit the CMHC can have 0.5% of its loan portfolio or a little more
a $ billion and allow it to be an annual reserve of about $ 100 million.
These amounts are more than sufficient for contingencies.
The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation has an accumulated surplus of $ 4.1 billion
which will reach $ 7 billion by 2008 if the trend continues. These surpluses are mainly
due to the fact that since 1998, almost all (all in some years) non-profits
spread - surplus - arising from insurance activities was fully allocated to the capitalization

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

117

tion. As is the case for employment insurance, the Liberal government stacked surplus
within CMHC rather than fulfilling its mandate. The adoption of this bill will
finance the investments mentioned above.

The federal government must respect Quebec's jurisdiction
The housing sector is a responsibility of the Government of Quebec. Consequently, the federal government should withdraw from this area and transfer its share of funding to the Government of
Québec in order to avoid duplication and confusion. However, this does not allow the
Federal Government to avoid taking its financial responsibilities, especially since Quebec
was hit hard by the cuts of Ottawa and its construction material choices
"Modest" which result today that many social housing have
urgently needed renovations.
The Bloc Québécois is asking the federal government to accelerate the negotiation process
with Quebec regarding the complete transfer - with full financial compensation - of its
Residential responsibilities.

3.7 Health as a fundamental element of social justice
Sovereignty will allow more coherence and stability
Universal access to health care, regardless of social status and income, responds to a
basic social justice imperative. The federal government, by massively cutting
transfers for health in 1990 has jeopardized the Quebec health system.
When the Quebec government put in place a series of reforms, these cuts
have destabilized the entire system. The abrupt changes in federal transfers also contribute
to destabilize the system, since the Quebec government in a situation
financial problem that makes long-term planning.
Controlling drug costs
In health, the Bloc Québécois will pay particular attention to the issue of control
drug costs. The cost of drugs is the job of the health budget that grows the most
quickly. In five years, it increased by 106% in Quebec. In Canada, the increase was
344% in fifteen ans55. The Bloc Québécois has proposed that the Standing Committee on Health studied
this question, a proposal that was accepted. We presented four possible solutions:
• expanding the role of the Review Board of the cost of patented medicines to ensure that its mandate
focuses on the behavior of generic production companies;
• investigate further the introduction of new drugs and mechanisms
examine the possibility of no longer approve new drugs that do not show
no significant changes therapeutically;
• further regulate the pharmaceutical industry by creating a register of practices
marketing and voluntary reporting of unsold circulated drugs
in the form of samples, as well as creating an ethical framework written by
Parliamentarians for pharmaceutical companies;
3.10 Safety and Justice
In terms of safety, nobody in North America has lessons to give to Quebec. The
Quebec is the company where there is the least violent crimes per capita in North America.
The Bloc Québécois is concerned about safety in Quebec and in Canada, but keeping in
mind that safety must never take precedence over the rights and liberties. Terrorism,
as the word suggests, is to terrorize the population by committing acts resounding
and to shake the pillars of democratic societies, or the rights and freedoms. Restrict
overly rights and freedoms is somehow give reason to terrorists.

The suites of 11 September: the balance between security and freedom has been broken
Following the attacks of September 11, the Bloc Quebecois thought it was necessary for the
Canadian government to strengthen its legislative framework in order to better fight against the threat
terrorism; we had an exceptional response to exceptional circumstances. However,
from the outset, we asked a basic requirement, must any measure of control
against terrorism should provide a balance between security and freedom.
The first bill introduced by the government in the wake of September 11 was the
Anti-terrorism Act (C-36). Although we have been supportive of the idea of ​​adopting such a law, we
were and continue to believe that the federal government's proposal broke the balance
research. That is why we tried to make amendments, particularly in order
a clearer definition of terrorist activity and avoid potential abuses. In addition,
Bloc Québécois proposed to add to the bill a sunset clause which would have limited its
application in time. Unfortunately, the federal government turned a deaf ear to
these proposals.
The Bloc Québécois was also responsible for the revision of the ATA, work that
started last December. From the start, the Bloc Québécois has requested and obtained the extension of the mandate of the Subcommittee on Public Safety that he is studying other measures or
provisions adopted or amended in the wake of September 11, 2001.
Indeed, the Bloc Québécois, efficient review of Bill C-36 necessarily involved the study
Security certificates. The Bloc Québécois has actively participated in this revision in the
last month and awaits the end of the testimony subcommittee to assess the relevance of
maintain counter-terrorism measures studied.
Furthermore, following revelations of the Auditor General last April, the Bloc Québécois
denounced the fact that in terms of security, the federal government has
no overall plan and not coordinating with Quebec and the provinces.
The Bloc Québécois asked then including the conclusion of formal agreements to fix
the respective responsibilities of Ottawa, Quebec and the provinces rather than indulge in
expensive waste of public funds.

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

The Bloc Québécois is committed to ensure that all legislation that affects the
terrorism, the balance between security and freedom is respected and requested the creation of a post
Independent Commissioner responsible for monitoring the application of any Law
terrorism.

The Maher Arar or the excesses of security Canada
Maher Arar is an Ottawa engineer 34 years. Tunisia born, Canadian citizen since 1991, he
made a stopover in New York while returning from vacation in September 2002, when he was arrested by
US authorities and taken to Syria where he was imprisoned for a year and submitted
to torture. He was wrongfully suspected of terrorism.
Upon his return to Canada, Maher Arar demanded the opening of a public inquiry to determine
the responsibility of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Canadian Security Intelligence Service
Security (CSIS) in his deportation by US authorities. The government refuses
First to order such an inquiry but, as a result of many pressures, including
Bloc Québécois, a public inquiry was finally ordered February 5, 2004. Justice O'Connor
is mandated to investigate and write a report including responsibility
Canadian authorities in this case.
Initially, the hearings were held in camera and Justice O'Connor had to settle for produce
a summary of the hearings. When he produced his first short, the government has invoked
national security reasons to butcher the most embarrassing passages, which
deeply angered the judge. Since the commission began sitting in public, but
government prosecutors continually trying to prevent sensitive evidence.
What emerges from the hearings is scandalous: it is on the basis of information
Canadian that US authorities sent Arar to torture sir. This information
were based on fact and found to be false.
Canadian officials knew that Mr. Arar was tortured in Syria but
did nothing to protect him. The government does not systematically seeking to
guarantees that Canadian citizens will not be subjected to torture abroad, Mr. Arar's case is not unique, the intelligence services did not immediately reject
testimony obtained under torture, and the list of horrors continues. The work of the
inquiry continues and Justice O'Connor is due to report in March 2006.
The Bloc Québécois intends to ensure that the government will not attempt to censor the report
Justice O'Connor account and ensure that Canada never again resort to torture
outsourcing.

The other scandal: the register of firearms
The gun registry is one of the best examples of mismanagement
public funds by the federal government. Party like a good idea (increase protection
citizens by requiring gun owners to be licensed and to register their
weapons), this program has been an unprecedented financial disaster.
The costs of implementing the program were not to exceed $ 2 million (it had
be self-financing through the collection of license fees and registration) will reach more
a $ billion by 2005-2006, an amount 500 times higher than what was planned to
originally. In the report of the Auditor General tabled in December 2002, who studied
program costs, it speaks of the "Management mediocrity" of Liberals and adds more
further: "What's really inexcusable is that Parliament was not fully informed.
I wonder why the Department of Justice continued to monitor the escalating costs without
informing Parliament and without considering alternatives. "
The federal government will one day either explain to the public how it is that
Quebec is able to record all motor vehicles without problems and at a cost
reasonable, while Ottawa is unable to do the same with firearms.
Despite the Liberal mismanagement, the registry of firearms is a valuable tool
serving police officers to curb crime. According to the Canadian Association of Chiefs of
Police, for example, the registry is consulted 1,500 times a day and helps fight much more
effectively against the trafficking of illegal weapons. Furthermore, the favor gun registration
compliance with safe storage standards and help prevent weapons theft, and
especially accidents and suicide among young people. The program objectives remain
therefore valid and the controls in place are proportional to the dangers of
firearms in an anxious security of its member company. The gun registry
Firearms should not be abolished on the grounds that the Liberal government of Canada
unable to manage a program correctly.
The Bloc Québécois therefore requests that the firearms registry be maintained but we
ask, however, that the Auditor General makes an annual monitoring program for
prevent further slippage. Moreover, we look forward to the next report
the auditor should shed light on the reasons that have caused the chasm
Financial that was the gun registry since its inception.

Organized crime
The Bloc Québécois lobbied for years for the federal government to
forward effective legislative measures against organized crime groups.
During the last election campaign, the Bloc Québécois has pursued this fight and demanded that
the federal government fined the Criminal Code so that police and prosecutors
have more effective tools to fight organized crime. The Canadian government
eventually answered some of our demands by presenting the C-24 project amending
Criminal Code provisions that apply to organized crime. Broadening the scope of application

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

121

of the provisions of the Criminal Code on proceeds of crime now enables
police to seize, restrain and forfeit the profits that can be derived from a range
of criminal acts, which are linked to organized crime or that it facilitates. The efforts of the Bloc
Quebecers have paid off.

Reversing the burden of proof for convicted criminals
The Bloc Québécois, however, considered that a further amendment should be made to
specifically to tackle organized crime in Quebec and Canada. Thus, in autumn 2004,
the Bloc Québécois introduced a bill to allow the reversal of the burden of
proof, requiring an accused convicted of an offense related to organized crime
proof that its assets were acquired honestly and legitimately.
The Bloc Québécois put forward this principle by introducing a motion in the House of Commons
in spring 2005 that required the federal government introduced before May 31, 2005 a
bill reversing the burden of proof. In response to the motion passed
unanimously by the House of Commons, the federal government tabled Bill C-53.
As the days were numbered from the government, the Bloc Québécois has obtained the project
legislation be given priority since such a measure is essential to deliver a struggle
organized crime and money laundering.

The sexual exploitation of minors
The rise of exploitation for sexual purposes vulnerable or subject to the authority
others represents a challenge and a priority to stem.
The events surrounding the discovery of a child prostitution ring in the city of
Quebec has also raised awareness of the whole society to a particular phenomenon
discreet, though known to police and social intervention settings
concerned. But for the general public, these revelations and the extent of media coverage
set the tone for stronger demands for punishment of such crimes.
More severe legal protection of vulnerable people, especially the
children, was proposed by the Bloc Québécois and was particularly expressed through
depth review of Bill C-2 on amending the Criminal Code in this regard
and received Royal Assent in July 2005.
As he had promised, the Bloc Québécois did add minimum sentences for crimes
pedophilia, child pornography, sexual exploitation and pimping from
children. This is a package of measures that will better protect children in the future.

The atrocities of armed conflict around the world highlight barbarous acts
highly reprehensible and sanctioned by international law and the International Criminal Court. The investigation and prosecution in a similar instance of war crimes,
crimes against humanity and crimes of genocide are an important facet of our
commitment to justice.
The Bloc Québécois is committed to promote and support the prosecution of war criminals

Tobacco smuggling
The last few years have seen a resurgence of tobacco smuggling, as well
Quebec and Canada. In addition to breaking the law, this activity deprives governments
revenue that might otherwise contribute to the common good.
The Bloc Québécois proposes that the federal government invites the various stakeholders related
this issue at a national meeting to find lasting solutions to
this recurring problem.

3.11 The distribution of wealth and tax justice
No society can hope for lasting progress if it does not ensure redistribution
equitable wealth. Societies where wealth gaps are too large are
generally more violent, leaving aside human beings who otherwise can contribute
to the development of society.
The Bloc Québécois strongly believes that governments have a duty to ensure
minimum redistribution of wealth so that everyone can eat, get treatment,
educate their children and afford adequate housing.
In Canada, the proportion of collective wealth devoted to public spending decreased significantly in recent years, from 49.7% of GDP in 1994 to 39.4% in
2004. Since 1994, Canada was the G-7 that has most reduced its public spending.

Despite this sharp decline, expenditures of all governments in Canada
represented a colossal sum of $ 502 billion in 2004. Implicitly, citizens and
companies agree to pay these taxes and the taxes on two conditions: that everyone pays
its fair share and that the government manages money responsibly, honestly and
the common good. The federal government fails miserably in both cases.

Tax Justice
One of the oldest social pacts that exist is that of the pooling of part of the
wealth of society through taxes and taxes paid to the government. This uses
these resources to provide services that benefit all and to redistribute wealth. The first
rule is that each contributes to the measure, according to the laws enacted for the common good.
The pact can stand only if the tax is fair and equitable.
Tax havens Paul Martin
The Liberal government of Paul Martin built in system utilization by wealthier paradise
tax, a way to escape the moral obligation to pay their fair share of taxes that
to finance roads, hospitals, schools or pensions for the elderly.

The use of tax havens requires individuals and businesses to pay their taxes
contribute more to compensate for the shortcomings of others. This massive use of
tax havens by companies and the wealthiest individuals to escape their duty
to pay their fair share of taxes is an unacceptable injustice. When these practices are
encouraged by the federal government and used by the Prime Minister of Canada, this
becomes downright unbearable.
Since 1994 and the coming to power of the Martin Liberals, the sums invested by
Canadian businesses and individuals in the coffers of tax havens has increased considerably. Canadian direct investment in Barbados increased from $ 5.1 billion,
in 1994 to $ 24.7 billion in 2003, an increase of 387% in nine years!

Recall that companies established in Barbados under the jurisdiction of International Business
Corporation (IBC) pay between 1% and 2.5% tax per year, against a combined tax rate
29.9% in Quebec and Canada. The family company of Paul Martin is itself established
in this tax haven since 1995. The Bloc Québécois has assessed that he had and saved more
$ 110 million of tax in Quebec and Canada, while he himself was responsible for
Canadian tax law as Minister of Finance.
These avoidance practices, which have been condemned by the auditor general to many
times are not illegal because the Canadian tax law allows. An obscure law
adopted by Paul Martin in 1996 makes it possible for Canadian companies established in
Barbados to repatriate their profits in Canada without paying taxes. The 5907 Regulation (11) Tax
Income was specifically designed by the federal government to ensure that the
Barbados remains accessible to those who would use this country as a tax haven. Paul
Martin himself does not in private.
The Bloc Québécois has obtained the Standing Committee on Finance is studying the provisions of the
Act and the regulations of the tax on Barbados. Unfortunately, the Liberal chair of
Committee has everything to delay the study. The Bloc Québécois also introduced a motion
requesting that the House of Commons is against these provisions of tax
companies, but the Liberals opposed it.

The Bloc Québécois will continue to demand the abolition of the provisions of the income tax that
allows Canadian companies to avoid paying their fair share of taxes by settling
Barbados, a tax haven.
The Bloc Québécois has also passed, May 19, 2005, a motion that the Committee
Standing Finance considers the tax treaty between Canada and Barbados.
Canada also signed a tax treaty with Barbados. This agreement excludes
specifically the IBC, which prohibits the Canada Customs and Revenue access
financial information on Canadian companies based in tax haven.
The Bloc Québécois will continue to denounce the Canada-Barbados tax, which allows
Canadian companies and individuals to benefit from this tax haven to escape their
Tax duty.
The December 10, 1997, Paul Martin tabled Bill C-28, an Act to implement the
budget of 470 pages that contains a special provision for foreign companies
engaged in maritime transport, as CSL International, the family company of Paul
Martin. This provision makes a change to Article 250 (6) that ensures treat
foreign subsidiaries that hold shipping companies - in the case of holding
Paul Martin - as active companies. More concretely, this amendment gave the
opportunity for this type of company to avoid paying taxes in Canada and Quebec. As in
chance, this change is retroactive to 1995, the year Paul Martin moved the seat
Social CSL International in Barbados.
The Bloc Québécois will table a bill to cancel the changes to
Article 250 (6) of the Tax Act on income.
These measures will make it just the Canadian tax system and retrieve
hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes each year. This money can be spent on hospitals,
schools or roads, services that benefit all.

A more equitable taxation
Canada is beginning to tax the income from an income threshold among the lowest of
world, making sure that low-income households and middle class pay much
more tax than in other G-7. This is a financial obstacle for
families with middle and low income and a general depletion factor. Quebec, for its
hand, has a much more generous tax system that made sure that in 2002 nearly 41% of
taxpayers do not pay taxes.
The Bloc Québécois defends the general principle that the tax cuts are aimed primarily
place financially relieve taxpayers low and middle income. This is the reason for
which supports the recent tax cuts for taxpayers announced in the last
economic update.

Discrimination against French-speaking athletes in Canada

Following a complaint lodged by the Bloc Québécois in 1999, the Commissioner of Official Languages
made public in 2000, a study of the official languages ​​within the sport system
Canada. The Commissioner confirmed the findings of the Bloc Québécois to the effect that English
was the predominant language in the sport in Canada and it demonstrated that francophone athletes are still clearly disadvantaged in the Canadian sport system. Fifteen recommendations were then made by the Commissioner.
But in a recent monitoring report released in June 2003, the Commissioner comes to the main
conclusion that the French and English still do not enjoy the same status in the system
Canadian sport. Moreover, it deplores the excessive delays in Sport Canada to implement
recommendations and meet deadlines, while only 3 of the 15 recommendations have been implemented by Sport Canada.
While 22.7% of the Canadian population has French as mother tongue by the
2001 census, the proportion of patented Francophone athletes by Sport Canada
increased from 18% in 2000 to 17.3% in June 2003.
Worse, some figures show that systemic discrimination affects francophone athletes. Thus, in team sports whose selection is the fact of management, Francophones
represent only 11.4% of the total. But in individual sports, where it is the result that

CHAPTER IV - QUEBEC TERRITORY
Attachment to Quebec
The links between all regions of Québec are rooted in history,
family ties, business ties and culture. The first commercial partners
Quebec are Quebecers. The largest tourist clientele from Quebec, it is the
Quebecers. Hydroelectricity, forest resources, resources
mineral and water resources, agriculture or tourism benefit all Quebecers.
In return, those who occupy the land, who shall adjust that derive resources and protect are entitled to expect that people in large centers and governments take account of their particular situation and make best solidarity. Where
parts of Québec has problems, it is all of Quebec is concerned.

The St. Lawrence
Since time immemorial, indigenous first, then Quebecers of all origins,
have all used the St. Lawrence for transportation and recreation or as a source of drinking water,
food and trade. This majestic river has always been at the heart of our
lives. In fact, there is so much that we sometimes tend to forget and to keep its wealth
for granted. In the new century begins, Québec must think that the St. Lawrence
wants to bequeath to his children.
Quebec can not consider developing its territory without including reflection
depth on what is the geographical heart, economic and environmental. This was
the Bloc Québécois by performing an information tour and consultations in 2005.

Reverse the demographic decline of the sovereignty
To ensure the occupation of all of Quebec, we must not only halt
the exodus of young people but also encourage the installation regions people from
immigration and relocation of Quebecers from one region to another. For
get there, we need every region of Quebec can offer its people a quality of life
enviable.
The sovereign Quebec, free to determine the use of its financial resources, will reinvest
again in its basic public services such as education and health. But there is more.
It will have the ability to more effectively support the economic sectors at the heart of
development of the regions of Quebec, such as timber, fisheries, tourism,
mining or energy production.
The sovereign Quebec will also invest in the network of transport infrastructure
maritime, road, rail and air. This issue affects the entire province,
particularly acute in some regions neglected by the federal government
recent years.

The Quebec government introduced a modulatory clause which ensures that all programs must be flexible enough to meet the special needs of rural communities. Unfortunately, the federal government refuses to adopt such a clause. There
Quebec sovereignty will settle this issue once and for all.
Finally, when Quebec sovereignty will access it will be one of the most centralized countries
world. It will then proceed to a true devolution of central government to
regions, allowing them to adjust public services so that they are better
adapted to the needs of the population.

Devolution
For a decade, federal jobs were concentrated in Ottawa, depriving the regions
Quebec of thousands of quality jobs and local economic activity to them
associated. This has the effect further away clerks of the state of local realities and the
make it less accessible. The sovereign Quebec will maximize the number of sector jobs
public in the regions.
The Regional Benefits of sovereignty
The sovereign Quebec will decide on the establishment of certain functions of the state on its territory. For example, as part of its security policy, the sovereign Quebec will acquire
a number of ships that can be built in Quebec in its
shipyard. Sovereignty will allow Quebec to knowingly make such choices.
The political representation of regions
The regions are currently represented in the National Assembly and the House of Commons by MPs. In the National Assembly, the political weight of regions is important. To the
House of Commons, it is much more restricted. It will be worse in the future because the weight
on Quebec in the House of Commons is steadily decreasing.
This means that Quebec sovereignty will automatically give political weight far greater Quebec regions in political institutions than it is on time
current.

Ottawa has abandoned Quebec Regions
The Liberal government in Ottawa has chosen a different path. Members of the Liberal Party of Canada
are largely responsible for this situation because, rather than representing their
riding and defend the interests of Quebecers in Ottawa, they
defend the interests of Ottawa in their riding. This has had consequences
very negative.
In terms of air, sea, rail or road, remote areas were deprived
essential links to a dynamic economic and human development. Reforms
employment insurance have resulted in depriving crucial financial resources and people
excluded young people, in addition to undermining the development of seasonal economic sectors. There
management of fisheries by Ottawa led to a disaster. Job creation programs, which

132

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

should support regions with high unemployment, have been diverted to purposes
patronage by the Liberal Party of Canada. Tax incentives offered by the government of Quebec
are undermined by the fiscal policy of the federal government.
The cuts in the federal public service were draconian in the regions. The
cuts in transfer payments for health and education deprived certain resource regions
human and, again, undermined regional economies where public services
are fundamental. While postal services declined, the flags of Canada
growing everywhere. The CRTC, a federal agency responsible for providing telephony services
fair to all, failed to ensure minimum services in the region, some remain
unable to connect to the Internet or to have a private telephone line while
media deserting increasingly.
All this has contributed to deteriorate the quality of life of the population, infrastructure and
public services, all leading to a negative feedback loop that ensures that some regions of the
See youth from Quebec, never to return. The decisions taken by the government
Federal help to divide Québec according to a socio-economic divide. This weakens the
Quebec.
The exodus of young people, often followed by that of their parents, is the priority problem
certain areas. This trend can only be reversed if businesses
there are emerging and quality jobs are created. Companies will go where they settle
find the infrastructure and quality services. The Quebecers go
live where they can find a quality of life interesting.

Tour of the Bloc Québécois on globalization and its harmful effects by region
In fall 2005, members Jean-Yves Roy, Serge Cardin and André Bellavance, accompanied by
Vice President of the Bloc Québécois, Hélène Alarie, toured the regions of Quebec
to take stock of the challenges they face in the new environment
globalized business.
They met entrepreneurs, local stakeholders, academic researchers,
workers, farmers, in short everything that moves in the region of Quebec. They were able to
find that the projects are not lacking and that people wish to continue to live there and there
receive quality services.
Unfortunately, they also found that people feel abandoned by the federal government, its programs are not adapted to regional needs, the infrastructure is abandoned and that while companies are subject to a
concurence more vivid than ever, it does not help them face the new trading environment.
The Bloc Québécois proposes the following pages a series of concrete measures. These
will not be sufficient to diametrically change the current situation, but they
will pave the way to a different Québec, more united, stronger and better prepared to meet the challenge of
sovereignty throughout its territory.

4.1 The future of the St. Lawrence
A sustainable development plan for the St. Lawrence
The sovereign Quebec will develop a true sustainable development plan for the St. Lawrence, an integrated approach will harmonize the requirements of development
Economic an ecosystem vision of this river which occupies a central place in the
lives of Quebecers.
Integrated management of a natural environment means that all human activity is taking place there
assessed both in terms of environmental, social and economic, in a
perspective that takes account of future generations. This type of management involves gathering knowledge, financial means and powers of decision on this medium.
The current Canadian federal model is not conducive to the implementation of integrated management
St. Lawrence. The very low commitment of the federal government in the maintenance and promotion
enhancement of port infrastructure throughout Quebec, as to manifest disinterest
regional development opportunities and decision-making at opposing interests
St. Lawrence and Quebec maritime transport are all examples
this situation.
In addition, the difficult cohabitation between the jurisdictions of the federal and Quebec is a
obstructing an integrated management of the St. Lawrence. The most telling example is
doubt the existing legal separation between the bottom of the river and its banks, of Quebec jurisdiction, and water as fish habitat under federal jurisdiction. This particular situation has
multiple consequences, such as the duplication of decision-making powers and processes
Environmental Assessment. This situation also favors the appearance of empty
for some legal and political issues.
It is in this context that April 4, 2005, the Bloc Québécois launched its consultation on the future
St. Lawrence, entitled Views of St. Lawrence. Four working groups have traveled the
Quebec totaling almost three meetings in all sections of the St. Lawrence, Lake
St. Francis to the Îles-de-la-Madeleine. Members have heard more than 300 participants
who spoke on the four components discussed, is the protection of ecosystems,
economic development, citizen ownership and international aspects.
The response of the population to the initiative of the Bloc Québécois has been remarkable. Citizens and
organizations representing the full range of interests related to the St. Lawrence participated
many workshops organized by the working groups. In all regions,
MPs have seen a significant identity attachment to Quebecers
the St. Lawrence whose future is now a major concern.
The deputies found a high degree of interdependence between the various vocations
St. Lawrence. For example, public access to the river, the water quality and development
récréotouristique form a virtuous cycle, a winning formula that represents the spirit of
integrated management.

Some uses of the river, however, are in direct competition. For example, large
industrial projects arouse strong opposition on the part of environmental groups. Obviously, these sensitive issues require further reflection and
must be a public debate.
The regulatory and judicial mess that results from a decision-making power between a fragmented
many ministries and three levels of government was identified repeatedly by
participants as one of the main obstacles to the harmonious development of different
Activities on the St. Lawrence.

The federal government acts as master and negligent
The consultation tour showed that the situation is even worse qu'imaginée. To
problem of overlapping jurisdiction between different levels of government, we must
add confusion between the various federal departments (Transport Canada, Fisheries and Oceans
and Environment Canada) that operate mostly in silo, demonstrating
Ottawa has no overall vision.
The Bloc Québécois also found that the federal government has
supreme in the St. Lawrence. From its expertise in navigation and
Fisheries regulates most activities taking place and it controls its principal access,
or ports.
The federal government has appropriated the St. Lawrence but take responsibility.
For example, Ottawa created the Priority Intervention Zones (ZIP) but refuses to fund
properly. It controls the fisheries management, which led to the disaster we know. It controls shipping but refuses to pay for it.
The federal government is neglecting the St. Lawrence, for example by refusing to maintain port infrastructure which it is responsible, leaving shoreline erosion extend year
after year and do not concern the shells discarded by the army in Lake Saint-Pierre.
If he is negligent, the federal government, true to form, does all he can
to prevent the Quebec government to play a more important role. Just look
on the federal policy on the sale of ports to be convinced.

Sovereignty will allow Quebec to reclaim the St. Lawrence
If there is a general conclusion of this consultation process is that for the
Quebec can take back and implement an ambitious development project of the St. Lawrence, it has to have all the tools of sovereignty.
The Bloc Québécois wants to make the St. Lawrence a major issue
The consultation conducted by the Bloc Québécois allows us to affirm that the Quebec population
means that the future of the St. Lawrence becomes a major issue of political debate. We have
found a deep attachment Quebecers for this majestic course
water and its future is of great concern.

The Bloc Québécois is committed to the St. Lawrence a major issue of its political action
and parliamentarian.

Priority Issues: Lake Saint-Pierre, port facilities and shoreline erosion
This is the question shells that raises the most indignation in Lake Saint-Pierre. Indeed, there is
Always 300,000 shells (including potentially explosive 8000) of the Ministry of Defence
sleeping in the lake, threatening the habitats and prevents neighboring communities
to move forward with development projects. Moreover, despite the designation of Lake
Saint-Pierre as a world biosphere reserve by UNESCO, government funding to ensure ecosystem-based management of the area by local communities is
clearly insufficient.
The Bloc Québécois will intensify efforts to get the federal government to withdraw
shells in Lake Saint-Pierre and better fund the efforts of local communities to ensure
ecosystem management of Lake St. Pierre.
Shoreline erosion is the problem most frequently raised in virtually
all sections of the St. Lawrence. However, regional disparities are important as
the magnitude of the phenomenon and its causes. In the fluvial section, erosion is mainly
caused by navigation, while in the estuary and the Gulf are the changes
climate that would be involved.
In some regions, such as North Shore and Îles-de-la-Madeleine, the situation is alarming.
Thousands of homes are under threat of being washed away by the sea within 30 years. Citizens and
Municipalities affected by the phenomenon require some compensation on the part of
governments. They are asking the federal government to reinstate the shoreline protection program abolished in the 1990s.
While not as dramatic, bank erosion in the fluvial section nonetheless causes
losses for shoreline property owners and causes the degradation of natural habitats along
the river. One of the most affected areas in this regard is the archipelago of Lake Saint-Pierre,
has a hundred islands, many of which are ravaged by erosion.
There is no strong agreement on the solutions to shoreline erosion. The Bloc Québécois
therefore proposes to initiate a study to the Standing Committee of the Environment.
The poor state of several regional transportation and small docks is a real brake on
recreation and tourism development projects. In some cases, the laissez-faire government
Federal downright night in this respect to regional development. For example, stakeholders
encountered in Charlevoix were indignant at the situation in Escoumins wharf where access to
South Shore by the ferry, which is 100 years old, may be compromised. In many
regions are asked Transport Canada to invest in port facilities before the
assign or entrust them to local management.

Officials from urban centers.

Other proposals of the Bloc Québécois
To begin now a major shift with respect to the future of the St. Lawrence, the
Bloc Québécois will put forward the following positions in the coming months:
• increase the competitiveness of maritime transport, a mode that features large
environmental benefits and significantly reduces congestion
routière59;
• encourage local recreational tourism development projects that mobilize
population and must now overcome many obstacles;
• amend the Canada Marine Act to require port authorities to consult
citizens and elected officials regarding property developments and access
public;
• ZIP increase funding and increase their independence;
• bring Transport Canada to file a development plan for regional ports
which remain the property of the federal government;
• ensure that the federal government does not give the United States on issues
dispute concerning the boundary waters and to adopt an attitude more
strict on bypass issues;
• sign and implement the International Convention of 2004 for the control and
management of ballast water and sediment from ships.

4.2 The exodus of young people

Certain areas already suffering a demographic decline that is deeply
stressful for their inhabitants. The exodus of young people is particularly worrisome because it causes a negative spiral, both in economic, and cultural or social. Gaspésie

The departure of some young people of a territory to urban centers is not a phenomenon
again. During the last century, the rural exodus has led hundreds of thousands of people to leave rural areas to settle in larger centers or outside of Quebec.
Given the high birth rate until the 1960s, it has exceptions, little
affected areas as population growth remained positive.
Today, the renewal of the population spends as much by immigration than birth rates.
However, parts of Quebec receive very few immigrants, while the
low birth rate does not compensate for the departures.

Turn the tide
To ensure the occupation of all of Quebec, we must not only halt
the exodus of young people but also encourage the installation of people from immigration. To achieve this, it is necessary that each region of Québec can offer quality to its population
enviable life.
The Bloc Québécois proposes several solutions. First, restore the integrity of
public health services and education. Ensuring adequate access to basic services
such as telephone and Internet as well as the presence of regional media throughout the territory.
Then you have to adapt federal programs to the lived reality in each
region, starting with the EI program does not sufficiently
account of very diverse realities.

It will also significantly improve the network of maritime transport infrastructure,
road, rail and air. This issue affects the entire province but with

last years.
Finally, each part of the territory the economic sectors that are at the heart of
development. Timber, fisheries, food processing, tourism, mining
and energy production should not be overlooked.
Above all, however, it is urgent for the Regions of Quebec receive their fair share of
federal spending. After all, the population of these regions pay their share of taxes
Ottawa.
If progress is being made in all these areas in the coming years, all
parts of Quebec will be able to retain more young people and attract a
more from the outside. Quebec will be stronger than it is today. He will be
better positioned to achieve sovereignty and thus give Quebec the tools necessary for a genuine policy of occupation and development of Québec.

4.3 The shortfall Regional
The shortfall of the fiscal imbalance and employment insurance
Taking into account the annual shortfall stemming from the fiscal imbalance and cuts
Liberal in the employment insurance scheme for the regions, there is the negative impact of
these decisions on local economies. Each of the regional economies is so private,
Each year, several million.
Anemic capital expenditures
When construction goes, everything goes, old saying goes. If it were up to the federal level, it would go badly
in the regions of Quebec. While Quebecers pay almost half their taxes
Federal government, it contributed only 2.7% of total expenditures
capital (buildings, roads, bridges, ports, etc.) between 1999 and 2001 in Quebec.
As for public capital expenditures (by governments, local governments and state companies), the federal government and its Crown corporations do
was only 7% of the total for the same three years. The Quebec government, its
Crown corporations and municipalities for their part, made 93% of expenditures.
Overall, the Government of Quebec has made five times more capital expenditures than the federal government. Even in Ottawa, the Quebec government has contributed more to the assets that the federal government!
And as the distance from major centers, the situation is even worse. Indeed, if we remove the
large areas of Montreal, Quebec City and Gatineau, the federal government has done that
1.2% of public capital expenditures, or 38 times less than the government
Quebec. By region, Quebec and local governments contributed 98.8% of
these investments.
The Bloc Québécois will continue to press for the Regions of Quebec receive a larger
by structuring investments the federal government.

The Outaouais injured by the Liberal government
21 years after the federal government has set a target to ensure that the proportion of federal employees who work on the Quebec side of the Ottawa River
pass 22.6 to 25%, the proportion decreased. In fact, if one takes into account the Crown corporations
and agencies, only 20% of officials in the Outaouais, against 80% in Ontario.
Of the 122 federal research centers, only 17 are in Quebec (14%) against
48 in Ontario. Ottawa and its surroundings have 31 federal research centers, while
Gatineau has only one single (the Language Technologies Research Centre)
All this is the result of the fact that the government of the Liberal Party of Canada is committed voters
Outaouais for granted. The election in the Outaouais region of an elected Bloc will change this situation.

4.4 Quality services throughout
the territory
Public services and quality jobs
The first condition for people to agree to live outside the major centers is to
ensure good quality of life throughout the province. In this regard, the quality of
public services plays for many. The Bloc Québécois has calculated that the fiscal imbalance deprives
Quebec regions of tens of millions of dollars each year that would otherwise be
available to improve health and education, in addition to providing jobs
Quality able to retain and attract young families.
The investment in quality health services can retain older people on
territory but also to create and retain quality jobs. Education services
are even more fundamental, as CEGEPs and universities in Quebec established outside
major centers enable young people to study in their own region and provide, again,
high quality jobs.
You have to imagine the positive impact that can have the injection of several million dollars annually in public health and education services and Gaspésie
Îles-de-la-Madeleine or in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, for example.
The Bloc Québécois will continue to fight the battle of the fiscal imbalance in Ottawa for the
Tax Quebecers are used to improve public services throughout
Québec.

Federal jobs concentrated in Ottawa
The Liberal government of Paul Martin when he cut in staffing the Public Service,
focused its cuts outside of Ottawa. But when the time of surpluses and the creation of
new federal jobs has come, it is Ottawa that has benefited, not regions.

Citizens often bumping into telephone systems rather than to do business
directly with a federal employee; Secondly, the various realities of the regions are not
considered by Ottawa; and ultimately federal jobs become scarce, depriving
regional economies of well-paying jobs.

Media for everyone, everywhere
It is the responsibility of the federal government, through the CRTC, to ensure that all
parts of the country have access to quality media that reflect local realities,
to ensure that everyone has access to basic telephone services, including access
Internet. Currently, hundreds of people still lack access to a line
private phone, which is frankly unacceptable in the early 21st century.
The Bloc Québécois agrees to file a bill that will require phone companies
and communications to provide all the services throughout the territory they serve.

The closing of RCMP detachments
In September 2004, the RCMP announced the closure of nine of its 23 detachments in the territory
Quebec. In the months that followed, the Bloc Québécois has denounced this decision that jeopardizes
of Quebecers security and called for a moratorium on the closure of
detachments. Despite a motion initiated by the Bloc Québécois and adopted by the Committee
Standing Committee on Justice and the House of Commons, specifically asking the RCMP
keep open its detachments in Quebec with the requisite number of serving staff, the RCMP has
not hesitate to challenge the elected continuing closure of detachments region. The
Bloc Québécois vigorously denounced this unacceptable attitude that accentuates the deficit
which the democratic government of Paul Martin had just promised to rectify.
The Bloc Québécois will not give up the battle, since the reopening of the detachments
is needed in the name of protecting citizens. From the very admission of the RCMP, the main functions of staff serving in some closed detachments were to perform
preventive patrols along the border and to respond to emergency calls and customs
immigration officers. Redeployed to hundreds of kilometers from the border, agents
RCMP are no longer able to adequately perform their functions.
Similarly, the junction between local criminal groups, including drug traffickers, and their
national and international ramifications, makes more critical the fight against organized crime.
It is precisely the role of local RCMP investigators and they can no longer fulfill the
properly.
If the RCMP insists on maintaining its position, the Bloc Québécois will require the next government to deliver to the Sûreté du Québec operating budgets they need to ensure
the changing of the RCMP.
The Bloc Québécois will require reopening the RCMP detachments, or at least
transfer to the Sûreté du Québec of the operating budgets they need to ensure
Succession.

Quebec, in a pitiful state. Indeed, while the bridge repairs drag on
length of damage to the structure of the state and major corrosion problems are increasingly
and more worrisome. Yet the federal government does not seem concerned about the decay of this jewel of Quebec's heritage, blaming the interview on CN.
However, in its November 2005 report, the Auditor General wrote: "Transport
Canada must take steps that will ensure the long term viability of the Bridge
Quebec. "
That is why the Bloc Québécois will require the federal government to undertake the
necessary steps to ensure that the renovation of the Quebec Bridge is completed before 2008.

The Distribution center
According to the Bloc Quebecois, Canada Post can not justify the suppression of several hundred
jobs and the closure of the mail processing center in the National Capital nor the merits of centralized operations in Montreal.
This transfer would lose more than 300 well-paid jobs in the Quebec City region. How
can we believe that the loss of these jobs, which represent $ 12 million more annual
payroll, will have no economic consequences for Quebec and its surroundings?

Ottawa. The Bloc Québécois believes that it is contrary to common sense. It is the government
Federal adapt to regional realities, not the reverse.

Federal programs poorly suited to rural areas
Federal programs are often tailored to the major Canadian cities,
made sure to exclude the participation of rural areas. In December 2001, the Government
Quebec has adopted a national policy on rurality to support the development of
Quebec's rural communities. This policy has already begun to bear fruit. One of
the most important elements of this policy is the introduction of a modulatory clause
adapt programs to different regional realities. This means that each program
Government can and should be modulated according to the realities of each part of the territory. The way
to the federal government is very far from this goal and there is no indication that the
Paul Martin government intends to change things with his willingness to focus
its efforts on the major Canadian cities.
The Bloc Québécois will return the responsibility to ensure that the federal government
modulatory introduce a clause to adapt its programs to the different realities
rural Quebec.

Employment insurance system poorly adapted to regional realities
Frequent interruptions of the Liberal government of Paul Martin in the employment insurance regime
were particularly hurt regions of Quebec. Again, these are tens of millions
of dollars that have been removed from the regions, while this money, plus help
unemployed workers, allowed to boost local economies, benefiting all
traders and to create jobs.
This real embezzlement has also caused considerable harm to businesses
Seasonal who now have difficulty recruiting staff. Young people, who are
particularly targeted by the reforms of employment insurance, were pushed to the exodus. He is
urgent to implant them too long to expected employment insurance system reforms.
The Bloc Québécois urges the federal government to repay the $ 46.2 billion it
looted the employment insurance fund to improve the system, to end the "black hole" that
affects seasonal workers and to abolish discriminatory conditions imposed
young workers.

Local consultative bodies
The soil in which the social economy was born and grew consists, at
local communities and urban neighborhoods, a host of collaborative organizations

These organizations are in a way the living forces of their gathering places
community. By their actions consultation, they aim the revitalization of their territory or
their neighborhood, including by supporting the startup and expansion of private companies or

Some of these organizations are supported by the federal government. This is the case of
Of Development Corporations Community (SADC), but also, in part, CEDC. These
past, fourteen in number across Quebec are autonomous and are financed
jointly by Quebec, Ottawa and the municipalities. Others, such as CLD and
regional conferences of elected and elected officials (CRE), are supported exclusively by the
Quebec government. In all cases, the federal government is not bound by
their priorities for development.
The Bloc Québécois will take over from the federal government of environmental initiatives
there is consensus in the regions of Quebec.

When federal visibility is done on the backs of regions
The Quebec government is only able to implement an integrated policy
development of the regions because it is responsible for the majority of issues that
impact on regional development: municipalities, regional planning, education and
training, reception and integration of immigrants, natural resources, etc. It has a
regional development policy, structures exist, regions are associated with the development priorities and their implementation but resources are lacking.
Since 1962, the Quebec government asked to be the only prime contractor for the regional development. After 43 years of continuous debate, the question is still unresolved. Two
regional development visions clash, the shares are canceled, the stagnant regions. Between
1973 and 1994 there were an agreement between Quebec and Ottawa. The bulk of federal funds
passed by Quebec structures. But in autumn 1994, the federal government announced
it was terminating the agreement with Quebec and Ottawa would act unilaterally now, via the
Federal Office of Regional Development (FORD).
Paul Martin was the minister responsible for FORD at the time. Alfonso Gagliano announced this
government decision November 14, 1994: "The Federal Office will thus become true
information broker and programs, the one-stop shop. "No more cooperation with the Government of Quebec. Two years later, the first federal sponsorship debuted in
Regions of Quebec, through the FORD.
With money from the fiscal imbalance, Ottawa decided in 2004 to increase its presence in
Quebec regions by adopting a law creating a new federal Ministry of Regional Development in Quebec. The law provides no mechanism by which Ottawa must
the priorities of the Government of Québec or to take account of regional bodies.

The amendments that the Bloc Québécois tabled to that effect were rejected by parties
federalists. The Federal Minister will thus be free to politicize the action.
A transfer to the Quebec government of $ 428 million invested in Ottawa
Canada Economic Development this year would have allowed the establishment of a genuine
Quebec policy of regional development. Unfortunately, this policy is
currently impossible and the creation of a federal ministry comes only perpetuate the unproductive duplication we know.
The Bloc Québécois supported the position taken by all governments of Quebec since
two generations, namely that Quebec must be the prime contractor policy
regional development and that the money the federal government spends should
be transferred to Quebec.

Stimulate the second and third region in transformation
It will be difficult to reverse the relative economic decline of certain regions if they remain
confined to the extraction of raw materials to be processed all outside.
For regions, the 2nd and 3rd transformation constitute a part of the response to
problems related to the creation and preservation of jobs to international competition and
vulnerability to fluctuations in international commodity markets.
Consider here the mining sector that develops when metal prices are high and lives
crisis when it is low. Think also to the lumber industry, which still suffers from
trade dispute with the United States. The processed wood is exempt
US rights, industry would have been much less affected by the conflict if the sector
transformation was more developed.
In all regions, we are aware of the need to broaden the range of activities
economic. In 25 years, the dependence of the resource regions of Québec to the industry
Primary halved. In these regions, there were almost four times as many processing enterprises in 2002 than in 1975. This is a real trend but which
not yet offset the losses in the natural resources sector.
People are enterprising regions. Per capita, there are no less than business projects
region than elsewhere in Quebec. Unfortunately, they grow slower and rates
survival is less. Even if area businesses have assets to them
clean, they also face problems of their own (distance providers

To avoid that regions are engulfed in a spiral of decline, we must, like the Government of Quebec, the federal government put in place a package of measures in order to
encourage the development of processing industries.

4.6 Transportation
An integrated transport policy in a sovereign Quebec
A transport policy is an integral part of any development strategy
Economic. The infrastructure for transporting people and goods
constitute the backbone of a developed economy. For a nation open to the world as
Quebec, an efficient transport network and intermodal competition, which opens access
major continental and international transport networks, is particularly important.
The Quebec economy has historically been disadvantaged by successive transport policies of the federal government. The expansion of the Seaway was designed to drain
Quebec's economic activity towards the Great Lakes. Railway networks were
oriented along an east-west to consolidate national unity, while economic axis
Quebec Natural runs from north to south, to the United States. Similarly, the Canadian Policy
air transport is designed to promote Toronto, to the detriment of Montreal.
Although the primary role of a transportation system to ensure a smooth flow of
goods and people, the Bloc Québécois believes that transport policy
consistent and responsible must also take into account social considerations and more
environmental.
The impact that a sovereign Quebec will have on Quebec's transport infrastructure
impressive. It is possible to imagine the benefits that will flow at all levels.

Air transport
Over the years, the federal government has accumulated failures in transportation
air. The failure most glaring and most damaging to Quebec was the fiasco of
Mirabel Airport, causing a certain marginalization of Montreal against Toronto, which
systematically favored in the allocation of international routes.
Consequently, the Canadian East travelers are often in the situation
deplorable that they must pass through Toronto to reach Europe, while Montreal is
geographically better positioned to serve this area. In this context, the Bloc Québécois
proposes that a sovereign Quebec gives many air routes to carriers
International flights into and out of the Montreal area resulting in
increase in air traffic and the return of passenger flights to Mirabel.
Québec will be the capital of a sovereign country and, as such, will host dozens of embassies and international organizations, in addition to being in the center of the movement
committed state traveling worldwide. Quebec City Airport will have mass
criticism of travelers to offer international flight connections.
Moreover, a sovereign Quebec will have available all the tools to promote the service
air transport throughout the province. The Bloc Québécois proposes that Quebec
Module pricing sovereign landing fees and navigation fees, as

tax on fuel, to promote regional air transport. The sovereign Quebec will
also create a funding repairs and maintenance program of local and regional airports.

Maritime transport in a sovereign Quebec
The St. Lawrence has always played a leading role in the Quebec economy. So
the ports of the US East Coast still consume a larger share of the market
marine transportation, the federal government has consistently increased costs imposed upon
the marine industry while reducing its services and by withdrawing from maintenance costs
port infrastructure under its jurisdiction. This has resulted in weakening year after
year, the competitive position of the Saint Lawrence Seaway.
The sovereign Quebec will establish a policy to make the St. Lawrence an axis of competitive transport and himself to bear the costs of monitoring, icebreaking and dredging.
Remember also that the Saint Lawrence Seaway, conducted in the late 1950s,
was not designed to promote the development of Quebec but, instead, to satisfy
economic needs of the riparian cities of the Great Lakes. For several industrial areas of Montreal and for its port, the impacts were devastating. It is also
after a long period of conversion to intermodal transport that the Port of Montreal
has recovered from its decline.
The sovereign Quebec will prohibit the expansion of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, continue
serving the St. Lawrence pilots and regulate navigation on the Seaway
prevent bank erosion.
The Quebec government has set in 2001 a maritime transport policy which takes major Wherever unique potential of the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Among the
objectives of this policy, we are talking not only to increase the use of the St. Lawrence
as a means of transport and trade, but also to use the advantages of the St. Lawrence as a tool for socio-economic development of the regions of Quebec.
To this end, the Quebec government provided including the acquisition of ten judged ports
essential to the economic development of its regions as part of the program
Port Divestiture the federal government. The latter is however quick to block the
process. The sovereign Quebec, which have all the port infrastructure currently under federal jurisdiction, can truly implement its maritime policy.
It is in this perspective that the Bloc Québécois has initiated a broad discussion on the future of the St. Lawrence and conducted a consultation to determine the concerns and priorities of
Quebecers on the St. Lawrence.

Road transport
The road network of Quebec is one of the biggest victims of the eternal tussle with the federal government. It is completely absurd that motorway projects essential for

150

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

Quebec's economic development has been pushed for decades fault
agreement with the federal government that holds the essential financial resources to
such investments.
The constant increase of the vehicle fleet is one of the most serious problems
faces the Montreal area. Traffic congestion causes premature degradation
infrastructure, increased greenhouse gas emissions and loss
net productivity. Finally, Quebec companies exporting elsewhere on the continent suffer costs that affect their competitiveness. The sovereign Quebec will have the ability
financial develop and maintain the road network according to their interests.

Rail transport
Recall that the rail network is underused in Quebec, while the rail development
would save the costs of construction and repair of roads, while
helping to reduce air pollution.
The Canadian railway system was developed in a logical trade east-west, while the economic flows of Quebec are more oriented on a north-south axis.
Thus a sovereign Quebec will seriously consider the possibility of
build a rapid rail link between Montreal and New York. Such a project will enable Quebec
to develop its railway industry and technologies related to high-speed trains,
Train like Jet Bombardier.
The sovereign Quebec will support the creation of a high-speed train linking Quebec
Montreal. It may also accelerate the shift to US Customs by negotiating with
US authorities the establishment of a customs office in Montreal.
On the other hand, rail plays a key role in intermodal transport, essential way to transport goods in a sustainable and efficient manner. The connections between the
road, sea and rail networks not only contribute to the flexibility and speed
of the entire transport network but also deliver significant gains in terms
energy efficiency.
The sovereign Quebec will invest in intermodal connections, whether transport
passengers or goods.

Transit and the Environment
One of the favorable consequences of sovereignty to the government of Quebec
will have the opportunity to harmonize transport and environmental policies, especially
more than the transportation industry in Quebec is responsible for a greater proportion of
Greenhouse gas emissions in the rest of Canada, given the increased use
Hydropower, both by the industry and the residential sector.

For freight transport, road transport is the fastest but also the most
expensive and more polluting. Conversely, sea and rail are slower and
less flexible but also cheaper and less polluting.
The sovereign Quebec will adopt a sustainable transport policy of using
tax incentives and investments in intermodal transport, to combine forces
each transport mode in order to increase system efficiency while reducing
traffic congestion and gas emissions of greenhouse gases and promoting distribution
equitable transport activities in all regions of Quebec.
The sovereign Quebec will pursue a sustainable transport policy, including:
• using the regulatory approach to the automotive industry adopts standards
less polluting;
• promoting the purchase of low-emission vehicles with tax incentives;
• further developing the public transport network and promoting links
in intermodal passenger transport (buses, commuter train, subway, car);
• Supporting the efforts of research and development on clean vehicles by
example from the Centre for experimentation Quebec vehicles (CEVEQ), the
wheel motor developed by Hydro-Québec and the potential for manufacturing aluminum parts in the Saguenay - Lac-Saint-Jean and the North Shore.

Maritime transport
The federal disengagement meet its maintenance responsibilities of the waterway of the river
St. Lawrence jeopardizes the survival of commercial ports of Quebec, who have thus becoming
more difficulties in competing ports in Canada and the US East Coast.
While transporting goods by ship increased 600% internationally
for thirty years, and Mississippi, direct competitor of the St. Lawrence, saw its annual traffic
spend 450 to 700 million tons, annual traffic of St. Lawrence went from
120 million tonnes in the early 80s to about 100 million tonnes in 2004.
The propensity of the federal government to pass the carriers maintenance of invoices
waterway, dredging-related bills or icebreaking night to the development of
Quebec's maritime economy. These costs also impact on the market
inside. Some regions of Quebec have developed cabotage projects that promote
both regional development and intermodal transport. These projects are disadvantaged by
invoices passed on to carriers and the absence of federal support for these initiatives from the point of
financial and regulatory view.
The Canadian Coast Guard bill $ 38.3 million annually to the Canadian marine industry for its services. Almost half of this amount (47%) is assumed by ships
circulating on the St. Lawrence. Yet spending the Coast Guard on this territory
represent 17% of the total. The consequences of this practice are extremely harmful,
Whereas the US ports do not have to bear such costs.

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

Maritime transport is a mode of transport that has great environmental benefits and significantly reduces traffic congestion, which is why the Bloc
Quebec proposes to increase competitiveness.
The Bloc Québécois will continue to demand that the federal government take responsibility
maintenance of the waterway of the St. Lawrence River and Quebec to be treated

cabotage projects.
Major investments are essential to the rehabilitation of ports infrastructure
Federal, especially since the federal government has shown great negligence
concerning the maintenance of its ports since the early release program. Before launching
the Port Divestiture Program, the federal government spent about $ 22 million per
year to perform maintenance. This amount fell to $ 4.1 million in 20042005. He would take at least $ 70 million to make adequate rehabilitation of ports
Regional Quebec.
In February 2005, the federal government announced that it would interrupt the sale of four ports
strategic or those of Gros Cacouna, Baie-Comeau, Gaspé and Matane. Pledging to maintain infrastructure, spokesman Jean Lapierre noted, however, that he was not in
the mission of the Federal Ministry of Transport to invest in port development.
The Bloc Québécois will ensure that the federal Port Divestiture Program is
sufficiently funded and accelerated over the coming years.

The front door of the St. Lawrence
The gateway concept is based on a finding that the majority of activities related to
supply chains and trade is concentrated in locations
key geographic - the "gateways" - which are generally important ports - related
each other and to major markets by "corridors" that are the main roads
and rail.
However, this concept is not limited to the physical infrastructure of the transport network. He
includes several elements that influence its performance including:
• the issue of the labor market, including labor shortages in sectors
keys as trucking long distances;
• operating practices in the supply chain;
• increasing pressures in border management in key (security);
• regulatory policies and economic policies at all levels of
Government;
• municipal policies and practices on land use.

financial, the government announced $ 590 million for the Pacific Gateway.
The Bloc Québécois is committed to further investigate the federal project Gateway to the
Pacific and consider the possibility to resume the most interesting elements
for the St. Lawrence.

Air transport
Regional airline costs have increased faster than in air transport
in general and, while regional services are of crucial importance for
Quebecers. Transportation is the lung remote areas and their relationship
the world is certainly an important factor of economic competitiveness.
However, Quebec's room for maneuver is rather thin, since the competence
Federal air transport and the lack of a federal policy in this area.
The Bloc Québécois agrees to remind the federal government that section 5 of the Act
Canada Transportation clearly indicates that transportation must be recognized
"As a key to regional economic development."
The Bloc Québécois has continued its efforts in this area. It reminded the Government
the importance of reducing the tax on aviation safety to zero for regional airports,
reduce airport fees and 50% reduction in the excise tax on gasoline of
regional airlines.
In addition, the Bloc Québécois has denounced the excessive rise of the rent demanded by the government
Federal ADM, or 306% in one year. Ottawa presented a reform but its calculation of rent
implementation and the planned cuts are too slow, they spread over 4 years. In
Indeed, certain airport rents remain excessive, especially in small airports.
The Bloc Québécois will urge the Department of Transportation to cease penalizing
Quebec airports by exorbitant rents and propose an exemption for rent
small airports which handles less than two million passengers annually.

Tax on aviation safety
The tax on aviation safety, introduced in response to the events of September 11, 2001,
and paid by passengers since 1 April 2002, affects the airline industry. This
tax is partly responsible for the slowdown in passenger traffic and is a burden
extra for an already heavily penalized industry.
Dorval and Mirabel: Toronto Dorval
On May 9, 2002, the Board of Directors of Aéroports de Montreal (ADM), which manages airports
Mirabel and Dorval, announced the end passenger flights to Mirabel. Note that since
1996, though most international flights were repatriated in Dorval, charters remained
Mirabel. This is no longer the case since November 2004. The end passenger flights in Mirabel
marks a significant step in the saga of the airport since its construction.

Bad decisions Ottawa since 1969 are responsible for the current situation. The
transfer to Dorval and costs that follow are the result of those bad decisions.
Everyone in Quebec knows how the action of the federal government in the record
Air Transport in Montreal over the last 35 years has been disastrous,
resulting in the decline of Montreal as a hub for air transport in the North East
US.
It's the federal government that grants international routes and it has
Toronto promoted at the expense of Montreal, a completely inconsistent policy with the decision to build a second major airport (Mirabel) in the Montreal region.
The simplified explanation of the federal Liberals to the effect that Montreal's economy and trends in international air transport have caused the failure of Mirabel does not hold water.
As explained Jacques Girard, who was CEO of the agency Montreal
International: "There is not enough traffic because it does not cause flights to Montreal, we
brings all flights in Toronto ... I think it is a nonsense to get people to come to Halifax
Toronto to return to Europe. "60
The failure of Mirabel is attributable to the federal government that did not even finish the
necessary for its development infrastructure, that is to say the highways 13 and 50 and
rail link with Montreal.
The federal government must stop systematically favor the Toronto airport and must
give more international routes to Montreal. The Eastern travelers
Canada are in the unfortunate situation where they have too often through Toronto
to go to Europe, while Montreal is geographically better positioned to serve
this region.
SARS, which hit Toronto in 2003, illustrates the disadvantage of the concentration of flights
International in Toronto. In this case, tourists from overseas were wanting to visit Quebec
mostly through Toronto, which had the effect of extending the impact of the crisis
SARS on the tourism industry in Quebec, even though no cases were detected. In addition, it is
tempting for a foreign tourist to focus his visit to the Toronto area, because sometimes
and goes from there.
The Bloc Québécois will demand the granting of international air routes in Montreal, so
to reduce the concentration of international routes in Toronto.

Mirabel airport: preserve the future
In March 1969, the federal government announced the construction project of the airport
International Mirabel and filed the largest expropriation plan ever seen in Canada:
97,000 acres, or 10 times the size of the largest airports in the world and 27 times that of Dorval.
3000 families have been affected.

After 35 years and a first surrender of 80,000 acres by the Conservative government
Mulroney, 17,000 acres of land are still federal property. Farmers and
expropriated Mirabel demand the surrender of 11,000 acres of land. The 6,000 acres
still represent twice the area of ​​Dorval and more than enough for the future development of airport activities.
The Bloc Québécois introduced a motion in this sense and supported in a second filed by
another opposition party. Both motions were passed but the government continues to
turn a deaf ear.
The Bloc Québécois agrees to return to the charge on the issue of the return of land
Mirabel until it has been successful.
Furthermore, the federal government must put in place the conditions to preserve
Mirabel infrastructures: runways, terminal, control tower and other facilities.
A sovereign Quebec will need a world-class airport with the capacity
necessary to accommodate air traffic which then inevitably increase. Sooner or later,
will come back to Mirabel. In this context, it would be irresponsible to let them deteriorate
buildings and airport equipment, or to convert them to a vocation
which has nothing to do with airport activity.
The Bloc Québécois will ensure that the buildings and Mirabel airport equipment
are kept in good condition.
In this regard, Aeroports de Montreal (ADM) has already announced its intention to build on the Zone
international trade in order to develop the full potential of Mirabel in an industrial role and
all cargo. The Bloc Québécois believes that this industrial vocation of the airport must be supported

Recall that it was the Quebec government that introduced the "international trade zone" to enjoy the presence of Mirabel Airport and accelerate development
economic development of the Lower Laurentians region. The federal government has never supported
This initiative is yet effective and employment creation.
One of the concrete contributions of the federal government would be to facilitate the implementation
of companies using Mirabel as a springboard to re-export some of their products after
processing activities. There are already Canadian exemption or deferral programs
customs duties and sales taxes but are complex to manage, especially for
foreign companies. The federal govern could set up a simplified regulations that would promote the implementation in the industrial area of ​​Mirabel this type of business.

Mirabel companies that would use as a springboard to re-export their products after

Road transport
Several parts of Quebec are poorly equipped in terms of road infrastructure.
These require major improvements, and the federal government has a duty to
its fair share in financing. Ottawa had a budget for infrastructure
strategic but waited Quebec to be able to invest an amount equivalent to
unlock it. Since Quebec is throttled by the fiscal imbalance, he had difficulty
match the federal amounts.
The result is that hundreds of millions of dollars dedicated to infrastructure
road slept for two years in Ottawa's coffers. Last spring, the federal government, faced with the possibility of an early election trigger, he had rediscovered
the necessary funds.
The Bloc Québécois is committed to hound the federal government until it fills the
promises repeatedly announced by funding its full share of investment in all
infrastructure projects.

Rail transport
Rail transport is underused in Quebec; yet there is a fundamental link
all intermodal transport system between regions. Encourage more intermodal freight transport would benefit from both the flexibility of transportation
road and lower financial and environmental costs of rail transport. The
development of intermodal transport and improving rail networks are
the obligatory passage of a freight transport system that is effective and sustainable.
Improving possible links between road networks, sea and rail help
the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The development of rail would thus saving construction and repair costs of other types of infrastructure, preserve the environment and to enjoy the effect
leverage the North American rail system.
The Bloc Québécois believes that the federal government can do more to promote
rail use in trade relations with the United States.

Fast train
The fast train project in the Quebec-Windsor corridor, supported by the Bloc Québécois, is
Butte federal procrastination. On 24 October 2003 the Minister of Transport at the time,
David Collenette, announced an investment of $ 700 million over five years in this
corridor, which was totally inadequate given that the cost of such infrastructure
project is estimated at $ 3 billion. At the very least, these funds could have been used to improve existing rail services, which in some cases, need much. But there,

new bill (C-44), which would have to correct, at least in part, this problem. For
a second time, the bill died on the order paper.

4.7 Municipal infrastructure
The economic development of a society and the quality of life of its people rely on in good infrastructure: roads, production and distribution of drinking water, collection and treatment of waste water, etc. In several municipalities, these installations require so
urgent significant investments due to their often advanced state of deterioration.
In a study published in spring 2003, the Conference Board of Canada concluded that
$ 17.9 billion was needed to upgrade infrastructure in Quebec
a period of fifteen years. Between 1994 and 2003, the federal government has invested only
$ 1.15 billion in municipal infrastructure in Quebec.
In the last budget, the federal government finally agreed to pay part of
product of the gas tax to municipalities. The Bloc Québécois had, however, denounced the
willingness of the federal government to link the payment of amounts in respect of
conditions established by Ottawa as the federal government has no business jurisdiction
Municipal.
Thus, July 28, 2004, the Minister of State for Infrastructure and Communities, John Godfrey,
stated that the agreements between the federal government and Quebec and the provinces
should be "in accordance with the Federal orientation" and contain "shared national objectives."
Only after pressure from the Bloc Québécois and estoppel categorical
the Government of Quebec that the federal government abandoned the idea of ​​imposing
conditions on the transfer of a portion of the gas tax.
Also in the Budget 2005, the federal government said that federal infrastructure programs (Canadian Strategic Infrastructure Fund, Infrastructure Fund
Municipal, the Border Infrastructure Fund) will be renewed "after maturity" but
provide sums for this purpose.
The Bloc Québécois is asking the federal government to implement a new program
municipal and strategic infrastructures and to ensure that these investments are
recurring. Any federal funding to municipalities must be in compliance with
jurisdiction of the Quebec government, which will remain the prime contractor for
infrastructure programs.

Transit and Kyoto

Urban centers are experiencing their own challenges. The use of the automobile and

4.8 The Quebec agriculture
If there is an economic sector at the heart of the occupation of Quebec territory, this is the
agricultural sector. With sales of $ 6.3 billion made by 44 000 farmers established on
31,000 farms, agriculture in Quebec, this is important.
In recent years the company has been very demanding of the farmers. They are
demand to produce better food and more diverse at the best price, take care of the environment and develop Québec for the entire society.
Quebec farmers have largely met these challenges. The quality and diversity of their
food production has increased, prices have remained low, they have greatly improved their
environmental practices and continue to develop in Quebec, for the benefit
of the entire population. Unfortunately, we do not give them their fair share prices
Consumer benefiting especially intermediaries.
But Ottawa supports and defends evil Quebec agriculture that has developed over the years
on a different model of what is found in Canada. Our agriculture needs
and does not accommodate different pan-Canadian measures of Ottawa.
In Quebec, agriculture is practiced on smaller farms where it has developed a much stronger commitment to quality and respect for the environment.
While Quebec agriculture quality grows with the proliferation of products
terroir, Ottawa takes the opposite path by promoting industrial agriculture and still refuses
mandatory labeling of GMOs.
Moreover, Canadian agriculture is largely export-oriented, while Quebec agriculture in exporting party, especially based on organized sectors by
supply management system.
Therefore, Quebec farmers and Canadian farmers have interests sometimes
opposite, whether agricultural negotiations at the World Trade Organization or
agricultural support programs, to mention only these two elements.
Until the government of Quebec will not be present at international negotiations and
as long as it will not act as the sole prime contractor for agricultural policies, the risk is great
Ottawa causes the ruin of Quebec agriculture favoring the interests of producers
Western grain to the detriment of Quebec. This alignment of the federal government on
West needs is already underway and is confirmed every day. The effects make
already being felt.

When agriculture is in crisis, it is the young farmers who abandons

steady decline in prices paid to producers. In fact, the price index of agricultural products
(FPPI) is lower today than it was eight years while costs borne by producers continue to rise.
Falling incomes, rising debt, many producers choose to abandon their
farm and succession is scarce. In fact, smaller producers and members of the next generation have
often not strong enough to get through this difficult period and there has been
a decrease in the number of farms.
Thus, from 1996 to 2001, the number of farmers in Quebec decreased by 10.8%
from 53 350 to 47 390, a sharper decline than the national average of 10.2%.
The decline in the youngest group (farmers under 35 years) is striking.
Indeed, from 1996 to 2001, the number of elderly farmers under 35 years fell by 39.5%.
Over ten years, the decrease in the number of young farmers is even more dramatic:
52% between 1991 and 2001. It is only now has 6,500 farmers less
35 years as they were a quarter of producers decade earlier.

These data suggest dark days for the agricultural sector in Quebec. But he is
can reverse this trend by building on the strengths of Quebec rather than betting,
as Ottawa does, on the strengths of other agricultural sectors in Canada.

Encourage young farmers
The first factor affecting young farmers remains the overall health of the sector. But
specific measures can be taken to encourage this generation.

In Quebec, producers of income is not growing at the same rate as the size of farms,
causing a debt effect. Combined with the aging of the farming population, using
Insufficient government, the cost associated with the possession of a farm (purchased or
transmitted) significantly impedes farmers.
The Bloc Québécois endorsed the ambitious objective of the Union of Agricultural Producers (UPA) and
Federation of Young Farmers' maintain the approximately 32,000 farms across the
Quebec's agricultural land by an access to the profession for any young person who demonstrates the
skills, abilities and skills. "
The measures to promote Farmers are working. Quebec is the only state
on the North American continent to offer a subsidy to the institution for youth
wish to engage in agriculture. Also, it is not by chance that Quebec has the highest
remplacement61 high rate farmers, or 53%. By comparison, Canada has a
rate of around 49.1%.
The Bloc Québécois believes that Ottawa should also do its part. After organizing a symposium in
cooperation with the UPA, the Bloc Québécois made five proposals to promote the establishment
Young Farmers in Quebec, the recommendations are based on improved
taxation, encouraging savings and consultation.
Proposal 1:
To increase the benefit of transferring a farm rather than dismantle, the Bloc
Quebec proposes to increase the amount eligible for the deduction for capital gain
agricultural goods from $ 500,000 to $ 1 million and only for transactions after
which it would continue operating.
Proposal 2:
That the federal government extend the rule of working with other transfers as "trans
fers parent-child ". The Bloc Québécois proposes to extend the transfer rule to other
members of the immediate family under 40 years (brother and sister, nephew and niece,
grandparents and grandchildren, etc.).
61 replacement rate: number of young farmers (34 and under) in the agricultural workforce in the number of farmers 55 years
and more likely to retire in the next 10 years. According Tondreau, Parent and Perrier (2001), a replacement rate
50% is used to adequately ensure the replacement of farmers.

Proposition 3:
Whether one is a farm transfer savings plan that allows producers
to accumulate retirement funds to grow tax. Governments could make it
as a contribution to the savings plan. This contribution would be provided
tional to the maintenance of the farm during the transfer.
Proposition 4:
Relax the rules of the Home Buyers' Plan property to allow young producers
to get all or part of a larger portion of a residence owned by a corporation and
to use their RRSP to acquire an agricultural business.
Proposition 5:
The federal government transfer a recurring envelope to the government of Quebec
to encourage farmers. By way of illustration only, the Government of Québec
may: extend the accessibility of the premium to the institution; improve protection levels
interest and raise the eligibility ceilings; establish a premium for young start-ups
farm business part time and gradually settled full-time. And
finally, he can develop a host structure such as a single point of informed
tion with the task of creating a firm bank without relief and respite without farm.

Promote the regionalization of immigration
While the proportion of Quebecers from immigrant increases
continually Quebec's immigrant population is constantly decreasing in agriculture.
Yet more than 20% of immigrants to Quebec come from rural areas in their countries
original.
There are examples of success. Quebec has managed to attract the majority of Swiss immigrant farmers, who are mostly settled in Montérégie and Estrie where they work in
the dairy industry. The majority (68%) of Swiss immigrants arrived at home
immigrant investors, already have the capital needed to purchase their farm. But these
examples remain marginal.
The Bloc Québécois deplores the rigidity of the agricultural policy framework that prevents Quebec
to use are associated with it to encourage young farmers and buying
a farm.

Providing extra income for farmers by facilitating the transformation
at the farm
The small size of farms in Quebec, coupled with falling prices of agricultural products, makes
agriculture less profitable. In recent years, there has been a movement of concentration which had the effect of increasing the size of farms.
This is only a partial answer to the problem. Within the food industry, the share
associated with the transformation increasing. Over 85% of agricultural exports

Quebec are now processed products. We must allow farmers to have access to this important activity. After all, who knows better the products
firm as the person who grew them? A series of measures may be taken by Ottawa
to promote this activity.
The Bloc Québécois supports the hiring field inspectors by the Canadian Agency
Food Inspection to supervise and thereby encourage, processing on the farm, he
Whether the slaughter of animals, production of cheese and other.

Do not touch the supply management!
The largest share of agricultural income in Quebec comes from organized sectors according to the system
of supply management, especially the dairy sector. This system has the dual advantage of
providing decent incomes for our producers and not causing distortion in
global markets.
In fact, the supply management system deserves to be better known abroad and could even
be part of the answer to the global agricultural crisis. But would still have to Ottawa,
which is mainly responsible for trade negotiations, believes it.
Supply management is based on three pillars:
• production is limited by a quota system (a dairy farmer buys a "quota"
ie the right to sell a certain quantity of milk), to ensure that
covers domestic demand but without causing overproduction cause
a collapse in prices;
• Production is limited to the needs, it regulates the prices to avoid too large
fluctuations, providing producers with a relatively stable price for their product;
• to maintain the balance between supply and demand, the borders are closed by
the imposition of high tariffs on imports of poultry, eggs and products
dairy. Thus, imports do not come to break the balance.
Maintaining these three pillars is essential. If one of them falls, the system collapses. Since
years, the federal Liberals claim to support supply management. However, whenever
the system was attacked, the government has helped weaken. Memorandum to Cabinet, including the Bloc
Quebec has obtained a copy in spring 2003 indicated that Ottawa would be ready to give up management
supply if the concession allowed him to obtain, thanks to the negotiations, a significant
reduction of agricultural subsidies in other countries and better access to their markets.

Ottawa evil defends supply management: the example of butter oils
The Ontario industry of chemical ice cream wanted to stop using cream in
making his ice cream to reduce its production costs. She therefore wished to
to buy a US feedstock mix mixed milk byproducts
with sugar called butter oil. Yielding to the industrial lobby but abandoning
Quebec dairy farmers, the federal government decreed that these butter oils
were not dairy products, which has opened the border to imports.

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

165

In five years, between 1997 and 2002, imports of dairy substitutes soared 557%, a
loss of half a billion dollars for Quebec dairy producers. An imbroglio
similar happened with imports of cheese sticks.
Butter oils are just one example among many. A host of products are specially designed to circumvent milk quotas. Milk proteins, mainly
of European origin, recently introduced, could replace up to 30% of production
dairy. Our dairy farmers, who derive 100% of their market income, can not
compete with foreign producers who are themselves heavily subsidized.
If the federal government continues its current carelessness, dairy farmers could
lose up to 14% of their income in two years. This carelessness is all the more incomprehensible that the WTO rules would be much stricter when it comes
time to determine what is subject to rates set to protect supply management. He
suffice to establish new rates for milk ingredients.
The Bloc Québécois will defend the full supply management in production and urge the
Government to tighten control of the imports of products designed to circumvent,
using particular Article 28 of GATT.
In addition, Ottawa is reluctant to unconditionally support the supply management in negotiations
the WTO. The agricultural issue is at the heart of this round of negotiations in the Organization
World Trade Organization (WTO). The supply management system is criticized by several countries
WTO members who want Canada to put an end to it and opens its borders. The United States and
New Zealand have already challenged in the courts of arbitration of the WTO.
It is imperative that the federal government, which is only sitting at the negotiating table, to have a
firm position: the supply management is not negotiable. That is why the Bloc Québécois has done
pass a motion in the House of Commons on April 15, demanding the government
Federal he makes no concessions on supply management in the forthcoming
WTO negotiations. This motion was passed unanimously.
Nevertheless, producers have fears over the true intentions of the federal government to defend adequately managing the offer to the WTO. This is why the Bloc
Quebec tried to reassure them by organizing an opposition day on the subject, to
recall the importance that management sectors of the offer will be subject to any
reduction of quota tariffs, and no increase of tariff quotas,
come they can continue to provide producers with market revenues for
to cover their production costs.
The Bloc Québécois intends, in cooperation with the Quebec farming community, fighting for
preserve the integrity of the supply management system.

We must reinvest in agriculture
Falling farm incomes was compounded by the Ottawa policies which dramatically

166

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

cut in direct aid to farmers for ten years. In fact, apart from New Zealand,
no government in an industrialized country has cut more in agricultural support that the Government of Canada.
• According to OECD data for 2002, the Canadian government support
the agricultural sector accounted for US $ 192 per capita, while it stood at $ 317 US
the United States, to US $ 304 in the European Union and US $ 438 in Japan!
• During the period when Paul Martin was finance minister, aid to farmers was
cut 36% from $ 6.1 to $ 3.9 billion. Taking into account inflation, aid
was cut in half.
The Bloc Québécois calls for reinvestment in agriculture, in accordance with
skills and Quebec programs, as long as commodity prices
agriculture will not be returned to a level enabling producers to live decently.

BSE: Quebec doubly hit
The discovery of a case of mad cow in Alberta in May 2003, and the US embargo that has
followed plunged the Quebec beef industry into a deep slump. The US market
represents 70% of Quebec's beef production. The border closure has caused
a glut and price collapse, ranging from 30-70% depending on the type of animal. There
partial reopening of the border, in August 2003, led to a slight rise in prices
calves and young cattle but not cull animals. But more is needed, including
establishing effective programs to encourage the increased capacity
slaughter to offset the loss of live animal market in the United States. Inter alia,
Slaughterhouse funding programs, such as that of Colbex-Levinoff, could greatly
contribute to help producers cope with declining prices, and take control in
controlling all stages of the production chain.
Moreover, costs have increased for producers who now have to pay for
services that companies offered them free before, like collecting
beasts.
Producers must meet financial crisis all these years; and for
milk producers, including cull cows can not yet cross the border, they
must still rely on the aid programs to get through.
According to the UPA, support for agriculture has been cut by over 36% in the last
ten years. Support for milk production was completely eliminated. This support represented
$ 120 million per year. This assistance could help farmers through the current crisis. Under
promise to adjust the price of milk to offset the loss of that grant, it was eliminated. Milk prices have never taken.
Subsequently, the federal government created a specific program to try to help
milk producers to survive the crisis of mad cow disease by providing compensation for the fall

the price of their cull cows. However, this program has never been adapted to the needs
Quebec dairy farmers whose culling rate is 25%, while the rate used
to establish support services is only 16%.
A québécois62 assistance program for cull cattle producers would be required to
overcome this lack of flexibility from the federal government. Aid programs established by
Following (PATI or FIP) simply excluded cull animals. It is now possible
measure the effects of this policy in farm debt and the lack of succession.
The Bloc Québécois request federal support in agriculture in respect of skills
and Quebec programs, as long as the prices of agricultural products
will not back up to a level enabling producers to live decently and in order
the dairy sector, the Bloc Québécois demand respect for the right price promise
to producers.

Regionalization of health practices
The Bloc Québécois noted that if Quebec were sovereign and controlled its own
borders and health policies, it would not be hit by the American embargo today.
The president of the UPA, Laurent Pellerin, made the same observation at a press conference,
May 21, 2003: "If we were fragmented provinces with distinct inspection systems and
marketing regionalized mechanisms of our products, only one province today
would have to live this problem. "
The current situation is particularly frustrating for Quebec producers who are
long subjected to a series of restrictions aimed precisely at ensuring the health of
livestock and the high quality of their products. For years producers
Quebec do not import any product from countries considered "at risk" as to the
BSE contamination. In addition, BSE procedures were implemented at
Quebec and it is mandatory to declare the disease since 1990.
Ottawa must quickly enter into discussions with Quebec to decentralize the whole system
food inspection and divide Canada into several health regions. Such a
regionalization of health practices would allow Quebec producers to be spared
by a similar crisis in the future and allow Quebec to assert excellence
its health practices.

4.9 Lumber: for a return to free trade
Quebec forest generates over 90,000 direct jobs, 20% are related to operations,
41% to wood products and 39% for pulp and paper. In fact, the wood processing is the
main source of manufacturing in nearly 250 Quebec municipalities, and
13% of jobs are in the manufacturing sector. This shows the importance of the conflict
timber for a large number of communities and the Quebec economy.
Following the imposition, in May 2002, countervailing and anti-dumping duties by
US, more than 10,000 Quebec workers were affected, losing the equivalent of
3200 years of salary. Quebec suffers more than the rest of Canada's lumber dispute
prime. Quebec's sales fell four times more than the Canadian average and the share
Quebec Canadian exports rose from 24% in 1996 to 17% in 2004.

Helping workers and industry
The conflict timber was extremely expensive. Legal costs incurred by industry
amount to about $ 400 million since the beginning of the conflict. In addition, to pay the countervailing and antidumping duties wrongfully charged by the US government, the industry paid
deposits are now worth more than $ 5 billion, of which $ 1.3 billion comes from companies
Quebec.
The $ 5 billion represent three times the net income received by the 12 largest forest companies over the past three years. And the amount continues to rise at a rate
approximately $ 125 million per month.
The industry is out of breath, running out of cash and need help quickly. The conflict
timber has an impact on the entire forestry industry because nearly 80% of sawmills
Quebec are owned by paper mills. Ruined, they can not renew their
equipment and become less and less competitive.
The US strategy is crystal clear: the imposition of countervailing and antidumping duties to the industry, they know that it is only a matter of time before companies
do not close shop. To meet this threat, the only solution is to support the timber industry until the rights unjustly levied by the United States are fully reimbursed. It is Canada's responsibility to provide such support. If it does not,
the United States will understand that they can win there to drag the conflict.
The Bloc Québécois demands urgent implementation of a real plan to help
workers and businesses affected, including the following elements:

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

169

• a loan guarantee program to allow companies to avoid bankruptcy.
Through this program, the government would agree to take the some guarantee
$ 5 billion in countervailing and antidumping duties that exporters have paid for
2002 and who are unjustly detained in Washington. Companies could then
turn to financial institutions and to borrow up to that amount,
thus ending the severe liquidity crisis which they suffer;
• support by Ottawa charges that forest companies, victims tricks
US court must incur to defend itself. Since the beginning of the crisis, these
court costs amount to almost $ 400 million;
• relaxations to employment insurance to ensure an income for affected workers
by the crisis;
• assistance to boost second and third transformation of forest products. Yes
This program was set up in spring 2002, when the Bloc Québécois has
asked, the impacts of the conflict would have been considerably lessened since pro
processed products of wood continue to be free to enter the United States.
The Bloc Québécois further undertakes to file a bill to provide financial support
for companies protectionist victims of harassment referred to in the future.
These measures would help workers and industries to get through the conflict. So,
when it is set, the Quebec forest industry still exist and workers will not
not leave their region.

Enforce NAFTA
Technically, the conflict timber is completed since August 10, 2005, when
NAFTA ruled that the US industry was not threatened and that the countervailing and
AD had to be abolished and repaid.
Moreover, October 6, 2005, NAFTA has ruled that Canadian lumber is not subsidized. With this new decision, countervailing duties authorized by NAFTA should
fall to below 1%. But the NAFTA rules provide that the rights below 1%
should be abolished. This is the first time in ten years of conflict timber as well as international organizations recognize the validity of our forest system.
In principle, NAFTA provided that all conflicts are resolved in ten months. Yet the conflict
timber lasts for 42 months. Now that the conflict is resolved legally in
concerns NAFTA, the United States refused, for the first time since the conclusion of the Agreement
Free Trade ago seventeen years, to comply with a decision of a panel. Still
recently, November 8, 2005, Deputy Secretary of Commerce David Sampson, stated
before a Senate committee that he intended "to stir all the stones that rates
remain at their current level. " The US attitude is incomprehensible and unjustifiable
unacceptable. The United States lost their case and must end their protectionism
illegal.

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

Because of the US refusal to respect the NAFTA, companies are reduced to having to
turn to the US courts to obtain justice, a situation we thought bygone
for nearly 20 years and further delaying the outcome of the conflict. This American choice is very serious
and threatens the very integrity of NAFTA decisions are supposed to be binding.
It is true that timber accounts for only 3% of Quebec exports but this
conflict exceeds timber: it is the value of NAFTA is at stake. That is why it is necessary
be firm. The federal government is sending mixed messages about it.
Sometimes he says he does not want to negotiate. Sometimes he says he will not negotiate rights
but countervailing shows open to negotiate the $ 2 billion in anti-dumping duties.
Sometimes, requirements are limited to what the United States undertake to recognize the authority of the
NAFTA tribunal.
For the Bloc Québécois, the US rights, deemed illegal by the courts of NAFTA,
should be abolished and repaid in full. This issue is not negotiable.

For lasting peace in the commercial timber
In the timber trade as soon as a conflict rule, file a US contractors
new complaint and the conflict begins a year or two later. Entrepreneurs and workers
Foresters can not bear such a climate. Who would invest to modernize a company
without knowing the business environment in which it will evolve in a year or two? who
would settle in the regions if it is not known if his employer will not be forced into bankruptcy soon after?
It is time to establish a lasting peace in the commercial sector.
First, we must intensify the pressure on the US to abolish the amendment
Byrd makes sure that the US government distributes to US companies
antidumping and countervailing duties it collects. Thus, it becomes profitable for companies
US to file complaints and increase trade disputes. Moreover, this law
doubly penalizes businesses here since, in addition to having to pay high fees for
export to the United States, they have to deal with heavily subsidized US competition.
A number of countries, including Canada, challenged the Byrd Amendment before the WTO and
won their case. The Bloc Québécois supported this approach. Having agreed with the
Canada, the WTO authorized the federal government to take retaliatory measures against
United States. The government announced in spring 2005 that will invoke that right. There
Again, the Bloc Québécois supported it. These pressures are beginning to bear fruit. There
House of Representatives agreed in November 2005 to withdraw this clause laws
US trade. Now we need the Senate to do the same.

The Bloc Québécois believes that we must maintain pressure on the United States for

conflict, it is not opposed to negotiations for a lasting peace once it is set.
However, it will not take such agreement gives a say to the Americans about our
forestry practices or penalizes Quebec than other provinces by a system of
unfair quotas or import taxes ruinous.
For nearly two years, the federal government is ready to settle amicably and discount.
It puts pressure on firms, Quebec and the provinces to agree to a deal
any cost. However, the draft regulations Ottawa has presented so far were all

Overfishing and depletion of fish stocks concerned many communities and these concerns are perfectly understandable. In Quebec, the fishing is Gagnepain of thousands of people and sometimes entire regions.
In Canada, the situation of the resource is alarming but be warned it is far from being
in every country. Just remember that fishing can be sustainable and that countries such as
Iceland already apply principles of sustainable management of fisheries resources.
While some countries are taking control, investing heavily in research and
development, support management on rigorous scientific methods, deploying
strong measures to combat foreign overfishing and implement plans
stable management, Ottawa offers to Quebec fishermen that a policy doomed to failure. Three
issues particular interest to the Bloc Québécois:
• poor fisheries management;
• foreign overfishing;
• disengagement of the federal government in the field of infrastructure
maritime.

Fisheries management: we must devote the necessary resources
Fisheries management is primarily intended to ensure sustainable exploitation of resources
marine. The essential elements of such a practice are:
• basic knowledge in fisheries management (knowledge of fish stocks, abundance, composition, growth and geographical distribution);
• regulation of fishing activities;
• the implementation of this regulation.
Now, we realize that Ottawa ignores each of these aspects. In the field of science
fisheries, the major challenges are related to the improvement of current methods of estimating
the abundance of fish stocks, understanding of the influence of changes
climate on marine resources and development techniques.
Research is especially important for aquaculture, a young industry that is still
the development stage on issues such as sustainability of the product, farming techniques, fish health and food safety, etc.
Now, the federal government invests less in research and development. According to
planned expenditures for the next three years, cumulative cuts
$ 150 million will be made to components "Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture Sciences" of
Fisheries and Oceans over 2004-200563.

The Bloc Québécois demands that the ministry continues its withdrawal and that at least it
maintain this budget.
In the field of regulation of fisheries, the main challenge is to fix
catch quotas at levels corresponding to the precautionary approach. One condition
fundamental prerequisites for achieving this is that the necessary knowledge is
sufficiently well-established to provide reliable results that can be the basis
of authorized scientific advice. The Canadian experience has also shown that it is imperative
minimize political influence in the regulation of fisheries.
In February 2005, the Minister of Fisheries of Prince Edward Island, Kevin MacAdam, even
filed a lawsuit against the federal government for "mismanagement of the fishery"
the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island. The government intends, among others, demonstrate that the requirements "partisans and policies have been considered in decisions
relating to fisheries management, the allocation of licenses and quotas. "64
The Bloc Québécois is calling on the federal government depoliticize the allocation of quotas
Based on scientific research, including respecting traditional quotas
Quebec.
During the implementation of the regulation of fisheries, the major problem is to
improve compliance with the rules adopted. It is certainly necessary to increase
controls and penalties to deter violators. However, the implementation of
regulations would be easier if the federal government established a real plan
transition to support individuals affected by the reduction of quotas and if he put in
Place a license buyback program.
The Bloc Québécois requires a federal plan to help industrialists,
factory workers and fishermen. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans will redeem
fishing license for groundfish by devoting the neuf65 money. In the short term,
federal government must develop special EI measures and put
establish an income support program for older workers.

Foreign overfishing

recommendations of the fisheries and oceans committee adopted in June 2002. The report

within the Organization of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO).

Maritime infrastructure: priority to small craft harbors
Fisheries and Oceans, the Harbours Program Small Craft, operates and maintains a network
ports to provide facilities for commercial fishers and recreational boaters.
In Quebec, the ministry's program is responsible for 84 commercial fishing harbors and
42 ports plaisance66. A budget of just $ 15 million was allotted to small ports
Quebec boats in 2002-2003. A parliamentary committee estimated that it would cost in 200167
$ 400 million over five years to upgrade these facilities.
The Bloc Québécois claims that the federal government increase its spending
capital to address the problem of deteriorating assets in ports

The seal hunt
The seal hunt is a legitimate activity has long been practiced by many
Quebecers. It helps reduce the pressure of these mammals on fish stocks.
The Department of Fisheries and Oceans has increased significantly in recent years

4.11 The mining industry
The Quebec basement is exceedingly rich. Indeed, we have several deposits
world class iron, copper, gold, zinc, nickel, asbestos, to name a few.
In 2003, the Quebec mineral production reached more than $ 3.6 billion, generating
18 000 direct jobs. Over 90% of Québec's mineral potential is still undeveloped.
If the federal government is not holding back its development, the potential of this sector
economic would be enormous.
Quebec may well have the second best tax system in the world for mining, according
a study by the Fraser Institute in 2002, this asset is weakened by the federal tax system that hampers
development of the mining sector. Indeed, in its fiscal measures applicable to wealth
Natural, Ottawa favors the oil industry. And these are regions like Abitibi
Témiscamingue and the North Shore who suffer.
On 21 October 2003, the Liberals adopted Bill C-48, changing taxation in
the natural resources. Before the adoption of C-48, companies were taxed
75% of the profits they were firing on natural resources. Henceforth, they will be
imposed on 100% of these profits but may deduct the mining royalties and
oil they pay to provinces.
Oil companies, which pay high royalties, are earning foreign exchange. Indeed, the
measure allowed big oil to include savings of $ 250 million in their
financial reports.
This gift to the oil, it is the Quebec mining companies that have paid. Indeed, for
mining companies that pay low fees, the measure amounts to

CHAPTER V - GLOBALIZATION
FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND
International politics of sovereign Quebec
Quebec is very open to the world. His successes on the international stage are
many both in economic, cultural, scientific and sports. The current Quebec
unfortunately can not count on Quebec's foreign policy that would be put in
implemented by a diplomatic apparatus in the service of the values ​​and interests of Quebec.
The foreign policy of a sovereign Quebec will be directed towards the pursuit of three
goals: identity, multilateralism, and the prosperity and development.

Democratize foreign policy
In Canada, foreign affairs are the exclusive prerogative of the federal government that can
exercise all powers without parliamentary control and without the participation of civil society.
This approach is not suitable at all in Quebec society dialogue and consultation.
The sovereign Quebec will democratize the practice of foreign affairs by ensuring that:
• that international treaties are submitted for approval to the National Assembly and,
in some major cases, they are subject to a referendum;
• that all consignments of Quebec troops abroad is subject to the approval of
the National Assembly;
• that, under the Quebec consultation model, tables are made
Permanent round with civil society on matters of foreign affairs, international trade, security and international development;
• that the government create an observatory of globalization and raises the creation of a
international network of observatories that could, with the experience gained by the various
countries allow Quebec to better respond to global challenges it faces.

The partners of sovereign Quebec
Currently, relationships are highly concentrated in Quebec within Canada and too
bit-oriented world. The sovereign Quebec will have international capabilities
are the prerogative of sovereign countries. It will forge new partnerships with other
countries and integrate or generate, new alliances.
The sovereign Quebec could, for example, conclude a free trade agreement with the EU
European, as already Mexico.

Security and international aid
The Bloc Québécois believes that building a safer, fairer and more prosperous
spends as much by the security measures and through international cooperation. Quebec
Sovereign will rebalance - compared to what is currently being done in Canada - efforts
Financial spent on defense for international aid.

A Quebec strength of peacekeeping and reconstruction
Apart from the traditional role of the army is to ensure the security of the territory, it will
also serves to maintain peace and order as a result of armed conflict. Sustainable maintenance
Peace also requires significant efforts and infrastructure reconstruction
institutions. The reconstruction phase will take military and civilians to work closely
together.
The sovereign Quebec will create a holding force of peace and integrated reconstruction.
To do this, Québec will be able to have a Quebec institute of reconstruction aid,
composed of government experts and private sector, also drawing on expertise
developed by Quebec soldiers. This institute will integrate the facilities of the former
Military College Saint-Jean.

Investments in defense benefit in Quebec
The sovereign Quebec will invest in the purchase of defense equipment focused on its priorities or
homeland security, reconstruction and peacekeeping. For example, it may acquire
multifunctional vessels (smart ships), and manufacture them in its own shipyards.
These investments will be primarily on its territory, generating activity
Economic and quality jobs.
The Bloc Québécois in Ottawa to defend Quebec values
Quebec's distinctiveness and its presence in the world participate in cultural diversity. The
Quebec unfortunately lacks the capacity conferred sovereign country full international legal personality. Therefore, it can not fully play its role in the world of definition in which it operates. He is not able to sit in organizations
international that define the international trade rules or more generally
relations between states.
Internationally, Quebec is represented mainly by Canada, a country that
does not recognize the Quebec people. It may be that the international presence
Bloc Québécois in Ottawa is the most essential.
Canada's decision to not participate in the war in Iraq nor the US shield project
missile probably would have been different had it not been for the insistence of the Bloc
Quebecers massively defended the position expressed by Quebecers.
Quebec also stands out felt a desire to change the face of globalization
to make a more just and beneficial phenomenon in greater numbers. MPs
Bloc Québécois played a central role in the victory that led civil society to get
texts of the FTAA negotiations in the name of transparency. They were very animators
assets of the People's Summit at the Quebec Summit. The leader of the Bloc Québécois proposed
the creation of a social fund for development in order to ensure a minimum redistribution
wealth at the continental level and support areas affected by free trade.

Whether to fight the worst practices of globalization, as tax havens
or flags of convenience, to advance labor rights or the environment,
to protect the fundamental freedoms and human rights, the Bloc Québécois is still
first line, true to the values ​​of Quebec society. These are the values ​​of freedom,
solidarity and peaceful conflict resolution.
The world is still too often face abuses that plagued the community
International must respond. In some cases, armed intervention is needed, either for
restore or maintain peace or to prevent crimes against humanity or genocide. This
was the case in Kosovo in 1999.
When the United States was brutally attacked, September 11, 2001, in New York and
Washington, Quebecers were then wholeheartedly with our neighbors and
friends, as evidenced by the support given to the war in Afghanistan. This war condoned by
the UN was legal, it was also legitimate because the Taliban government, one of the most detestable in the world, hosted and supported the organizers of the attacks.
This does not mean that the Bloc Québécois is always in agreement with the American administration, nor even with the actions taken following the events of September 11. From
Similarly, laws passed at full speed by the Canadian federal government as a result of these
tragic events and the obsession with security that arose often go against
fundamental values ​​of freedom of our societies.
The response to terrorist attacks promoted by the Bloc Quebecois, if it involves a tightening of security measures here as elsewhere, is based mainly on international law and social justice. This requires a strengthening of multilateral cooperation, strong international institutions, renewed solidarity throughout the world, the fight against corruption and interventions for maintaining or restoring peace. The Bloc Québécois does
certainly not advocating a new and ruinous arms race leading to the militarization
of space, as suggested by the US missile shield.
The Quebecers are willing to participate in the world in which they define
live and where their children will live. To participate fully, Quebec will have access
the status of a sovereign country. It is these countries that largely determine the issues and nature
relations between peoples.
Until then, it is essential to advance the values ​​and interests of the Quebec people. The block
Quebec is the only means by which you can do at the federal level.
Its candidates and its candidates are determined to throw their weight for these values
and interests prevail in Ottawa.

5.1 The World After September 11, 2001
The tragic events of September 11, 2001 shook the world in many ways and
those of 11 March 2004 in Madrid have revived concerns about terrorism. Quebec women
and Quebecers have been particularly affected by the terrorist attacks in our
neighbors and friends, US citizens, in the heart of New York, a neighboring city of Quebec
with which many links have been forged in recent decades.
The wave of solidarity with our southern neighbors was immediate and the Bloc Quebecois did not hesitate to
support a multilateral military intervention in Afghanistan under the auspices of NATO, to flush the planners of these attacks and hunt the Taliban publicly supporting a regime
the perpetrators of the September 11 attacks.
Both the Bloc Québécois had no hesitation in supporting the intervention of Canada and NATO
Afghanistan, as he did not hesitate to oppose Canadian participation in the war in
Iraq, a unilateral intervention, decided against the advice of the UN Security Council.
This illegal and illegitimate war has not served peace and security and is not in any way
an appropriate response to terrorist attacks.

How to respond to terrorism?
There is no doubt that part of the answer to be provided by the international community
Terrorism is based on safety. The NATO intervention in Afghanistan, the UN plan
against terrorism, tightening border controls, international cooperation
intelligence and police agencies are part of the answer.
For cons, the armed interventions based on unilateralism, international illegality and
"preemptive" doctrine of the Bush administration is a response neither legitimate nor effective.
This will result rather intensify the risks to international security and
to peace.
The Bloc Québécois is also very concerned about the security drift from Canada
September 11 attacks. React according to a policy inspired by the obsession with security
which seems to have taken hold of the federal government is playing into the hands of terrorists aimed
just to terrorize the population and destabilize governments. At terrorism requires
respond with force but by the law (international law), freedom and democracy.
The Bloc Québécois considers it important that Canada preserves its alliance and its ties
friendship with the United States. But this does not mean support all the
the current US administration initiatives.
Nothing can justify acts of terrorism that only rely on the will to destroy and terrorize humans. No justification can not excuse such acts. However,
reality forces us to conclude that terrorism thrives in the fertile soil of poverty,
corruption and injustice. Also, part of the response to terrorism is part of the
fight against the three scourges.

Multilateralism, a matter of principle
The Bloc Québécois supports the United Nations. This institution is absolutely irreplaceable.
Created at the end of the Second World War, all recognized countries had to adhere to its Charter
whose principles are still strong foundations of international order and always bearing
changes.
One way to fight poverty and injustice lies in the respect of international law and its founding principle: multilateralism. The Bloc Québécois supports the principles which are
on the basis of the UN Charter:
•
•
•
•

all Member States are equal;
must respect all the obligations under the Charter;
disputes between States should be resolved by peaceful means;
a Member State shall not use force against other Member States or even
threaten to use them unless it is attacked;
• Member States should assist the United Nations in any action under the provisions of the Charter.
The United Nations is the main foundation of international law. But the Bloc Québécois,
like many organizations and countries, believes that they must continue to adapt to
new realities.

Contribute to strengthening the United Nations
On March 21, 2005, the Secretary General of the UN Kofi Annan released a report
which indicates its intention to strengthen the UN. Its three main themes, live free from want,
live free from fear and live in dignity is a program that requires reforms
the organization itself, such as the expansion of the Security Council.
To allow people to live free from want, he reiterated the goals of the Summit
Millennium is to eradicate extreme poverty by improving the lives of people living on less
a dollar a day by 2015, and halve the number of those living on less than
two dollars a day. To do so will require that rich countries substantially increase their
International Assistance Envelope to contribute up to 0.7% of GDP.
To allow people to live free from fear, Kofi Annan proposed a series of measures to
to make the UN more effective in providing security. He recalled that no state can protect themselves
counting only on himself and must establish, within the multilateral framework, a system of
safety fair, rational and effective. He finally noted that threats are interlinked and
that development, security and human rights are interdependent.
Whether conflict prevention, arms trade control, strategy
global war on terrorism (defined as any act intended to kill or seriously injure the
civilians or non-combatants) and go after abuses human rights, only the
multilateralism is likely to succeed. Moreover, multilateralism gives one country,
are not superpowers, a place where they can contribute.

As for the right to wage war, Kofi Annan suggested that members of the Security Council
reaffirm their adherence to the UN Charter and recalls that the Security Council
has the right to resort to armed force, including for preventive purposes, to preserve peace
and security, particularly in cases of genocide, ethnic cleansing and
other crimes against humanity.
To enable people to live in dignity, the Secretary General proposes to adopt as
the responsibility to protect principle as a basis for collective action against genocide,
ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.
Furthermore, the Secretary General proposes changes to the United Nations to make it stronger,
representative and more effective.
Unfortunately, as sometimes happens at the UN, major powers trying to
monopolizing the debate and the risk is real that is sinking. Unworthy facilitator's reputation
internationally that earned him Lester B. Pearson, Canada Paul Martin and Pierre
Pettigrew has stayed out of the discussion. Paul Martin has delivered a speech before
the General Assembly of the UN, in autumn 2005, but he was content to lay down some there
generalities. Worse, the foreign policy statement he made in spring 2005 is so
insignificant it is impossible to know where Canada is in the great debates
shake the planet.
The Bloc Quebecois has already proposed and strongly defended several of these most reforms
important. It will encourage the federal government to agree to all principles
stated in the report.

5.2 International assistance
The Millennium Development Goals
The insistence of the Secretary General of the UN to the donor countries that have no place
yet achieved the goal of 0.7% of GDP in 2015, as agreed by all at the Monterrey
The Millennium Summit, reassures us and encourages us to continue to urge the federal government
so it responds to this request.
The Bloc Québécois noted regularly in the House of Commons that another
valid answer to terrorism is to increase cooperation, including international aid. Poverty is the greatest weapon of mass destruction on the planet, it
is also a breeding ground for terrorists.
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) said that the world is in crisis
serious. Poverty, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, has intensified. Over 1.2 billion people live in extreme poverty, while 800 million people do not eat
not to eat.
In December 2000, in response to the deepening crisis, the United Nations launched the eight
"Millennium Development Goals". These targets, endorsed by Canada and the international community, set a number of minimum targets to reduce, by
2015, poverty, hunger, illiteracy, sexism and environmental degradation.
Like other developed countries, Canada has committed to contribute to the achievement of the "Millennium Development Goals", by substantially raising its State aid budgets
to development, focusing more aid to a number of particularly hard and targeting the best country to a number of priorities for social development (health, nutrition, AIDS, child protection). The Bloc Québécois applauds these initiatives.
But in his recent statement of international policy for the coming years, the government
Canada has shamefully refused to set a deadline for achieving these "development goals
Millennium ".
Already, though, when Lester B. Pearson was foreign minister, he was committed to
devote to official development assistance equivalent to budget
0.7% of gross national product. This envelope has continued to melt, rising from just under
0.5% in 1991-1992 to 0.45% in 1993 and 0.25% in 2000. The decline has been particularly marked since the Liberal Party forms the government of Canada.

Goal

In 2002-2003, Canada ranked 12th among the 22 countries that form the Assistance Committee
OECD Development where he held the 6th place seven years earlier.
Ironically, Paul Martin suggested during his 2003 speech on foreign policy, that
his government shows leadership in the fight against poverty and "dedicated
constructively in the areas where he knows he can do useful work. " However,
that is the time he held the position of Minister of Finance that the cuts in aid
Development proved the most severe in thirty years.
Since the low of 2000-2001, there were few whose principal reinvestments appears
2003 budget: the federal government then announced its decision to increase foreign aid
8% per year for the doubling by 2009.
But this effort will bring the ODA at 0.32% of GDP in 2009. We
are still far from the situation that prevailed in the early 1990s before the Liberal cuts. At this rate, Canada will certainly not meet its commitment
to achieve the target of 0.7% in 2015 and it does not contribute its fair share to the respect of international obligations with regard to the "Millennium Development Goals". And $ 500 million made at the last budget will not suffice.
The Bloc Québécois proposes that the federal government establish a more realistic plan
aimed at achieving the target set by the United Nations - 0.7% of GDP - in international aid
by 2015. To achieve this, it should increase the budgets of development aid at a rate
average 12% to 15% per year.
The Bloc Québécois proposes that the federal government determines any bilateral aid
respect for fundamental human rights. He must also ensure that funds
are not diverted from their original purpose.

NGOs in region
Small nongovernmental organizations of solidarity that are situated in regions
Quebec, including the International Solidarity Center of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean,
are raising awareness and citizen education essential in the current environment of openness to the world.

Internships controlled by these organizations obviously allow programs to communities in developing countries to acquire technical, material and human resources to
take charge of their own development. They also allow young regions
outside major centers to open up to other cultures, to get involved as volunteers in activities aimed at the development of a just and equitable world and participate
internships abroad that are supervised professionally. The current global context
makes it essential regional access to the world like the one offered by organizations not
regional government.
Considering the importance of maintaining these organizations in the regions, we must ensure
that policies and rules for the application of CIDA's aid programs, which have
immediate effects on such cooperation organizations, take account of the regional specificity
these NGOs.
The Bloc Québécois will ensure that CIDA contributes to maintaining cooperation agencies
in their respective regions and the consolidation of their existence.

For a real foreign policy
Canada has no foreign policy. That adopted ten years ago, just after the collapse of the Soviet Union, is completely outdated. Canada had not provided the then
effects of the rise of the American superpower, the weakening of multilateral institutions, the rise of terrorism or the widening gap between rich and
poor. It is time to adopt a new foreign policy.
In spring 2005, the Paul Martin government released a policy statement
foreign. Now, despite the fact that the revision of foreign policy is announced since October
2001, the document is so badly put together that it seems to have been published even before the exercise is completed. The exercise will have been, in the end, a pathetic attempt at diversion intended to distract attention from the public right in the sponsorship scandal.
Nothing in the policy statement makes it possible to know what the Canadian position on what
whatsoever. We were told a foreign policy. It's still looking.
The Bloc Québécois would have liked that foreign policy is based on a number of
principles supposed to guide Canada's actions abroad: rule of law, multilateralism
as the foundation of the international order, fight against poverty, respect for human rights,
international trade as a tool for promotion of fundamental rights, maintaining the priority
Peace for defense, etc. The statement did not contain any unfortunately.
The Bloc Québécois will continue to insist that the government should rapidly adopt a real foreign policy and that it should be preceded by broad consultations with parliamentarians and civil society.

5.3 globalization with a human face
The current course of globalization, a phenomenon bearing great expectations but
also great injustices must be inflected. The disparity of wealth, the non-respect of rights
and freedoms and the free trade of any environmental regulation and
Work create more despair than otherwise. The structural adjustment policies of the Fund
International Monetary (IMF) have resulted destabilize states and impoverish
populations rather than mitigate crises.
Openness to trade and the creation of international regulations to counter protectionism and
protect investment are good things that the Bloc Québécois adheres. This
not mean that trade rules should take precedence over the common good and the ability
of States to redistribute wealth, protect the environment and culture and ensure their citizens
basic public services such as health and education.

A reform of international financial institutions
In recent years, there are countless economic and social shocks that were
amplified by the imposition of structural adjustment policies of the IMF. Rather than allowing
a return to stability and combat poverty, these policies have brutally destroyed, sometimes
in a few weeks, the economic and social progress that had taken years,
even decades of work.
Note that IMF decisions are dictated more by private financial interests by the common good. Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Laureate and former Vice President
the World Bank, said this receiving his honorary doctorate at the University of Leuven,
February 3, 2003: "By becoming increasingly interdependent, we discovered that we
needed rules to govern the process of globalization and to create institutions
helping it to work. Unfortunately, these rules have often been determined by countries
rich to serve their interests and above individual interests within these countries. "
Paul Martin, who is quick to put forward year service as Chairman of
G-20 and had the audacity to invite Bono to his coronation as leader of the Liberal Party
Canada will one day explain why he did absolutely nothing to reform the IMF while
served for nine years on the Board of Governors of the institution.
The Bloc Québécois is committed to participate in the broad international movement to
amend the Bretton Woods Agreements Act and related agreements so that these agreements
include respect for human and social rights as an integral part of the mandate
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to ensure that policy development
these organizations take account of the effects of these on the progress or deterioration in
respect for human rights.

The Martin government: an obstacle to an orderly and humane globalization.
In the 1980s and 1990s, many believed that the liberalization of trade, foreign investment protection and all-out deregulation would lead to
unprecedented wave of economic progress.
We now know that trade liberalization has its share of perverse effects if it is not
not marked by considerations of human, social or environmental. Inequalities
increase, states are losing their regulatory capacities and opportunities to exploit more
low multiply. The neoliberal turn has turned into neoliberal mirage.
Now, as the US government, the Canadian government continues to defend a
completely outdated position. They demand a "wall to wall" protection for investors, excessive reduction of powers of the States and a lack of perspective
development, environmental protection and workers' rights.
Conversely, Southern countries, Brazil in mind, wish to preserve the state's ability
to work for the common good. Result: the negotiations stalled, both in the WTO as
concerning the creation of a free trade area of ​​the Americas (FTAA). Ironically,
advocates of neoliberal globalization have become a brake on globalization, demonstrating
that the world needs another globalization, globalization with a human face.
Rather than pursue its policy of confrontation with the countries of the southern hemisphere,
Martin government must take into account their concerns and adopt a position
negotiation that is more respectful of persons and peoples. The Bloc Québécois advocates
a human face to globalization and trade agreements that take into account
social, cultural, human and environmental.
The Bloc Québécois intends to use the parliamentary tools at its disposal to bring the
Government to review fully its negotiating position in trade forums
International.

Democratize the process of concluding trade agreements
In addition, the Bloc Québécois press democratization of the negotiation process and
ratification of trade agreements by Canada. In 2005, the Bloc Québécois presented a
Bill to democratize the process of negotiation and conclusion of international treaties. The bill would have made mandatory the following practices:
•
•
•
•

systematic tabling of treaties in the House of Commons;
continuous information on the progress of trade negotiations;
approval of important treaties by the House;
consultation of civil society by a parliamentary committee before Parliament
decides on an important treaty;
• Mandatory consultation before provinces to negotiate a treaty within their
skill.

This practice already exists in Quebec since 2002. Unfortunately, in Ottawa, all parties
Federalists rejected it. The NDP would not consult the provinces,
Conservatives do not want to give a greater role in Quebec and the Liberals wanted
continue to not make anyone accountable.
The Bloc Québécois will return to the charge and will reintroduce a bill to
democratize the process of adopting international agreements.

The North American Free Trade Agreement and Chapter 11
Chapter 11 of NAFTA on investments is simply unacceptable. It grants to
foreign multinationals the right to challenge the laws of a country if they think that these laws
prevent them from freely enjoying their investments.
International law, the name suggests, aims to manage the relationships between nations. By giving
to multinational companies about the status of international law, their governments
have conferred the power to act on the margins of political power, out of his control. Considering
of all the problems it has caused in ten years, this chapter must be renegotiated.
Now the federal government is not content to defend all decry this chapter; he
seeks to replicate the. Indeed, in addition to seeking to include a copy of Chapter 11 in the
FTAA, and thus to extend its reach to all three Americas, he concluded twenty bilateral agreements which are true copies.

The Social Fund for Development
Eleven years after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement between Canada, the United States and Mexico (NAFTA), we can see that this treaty, which created the largest area
World free trade has allowed a lot of progress but it also has its share
shortcomings. Mexico is still far from Canada and the United States in economic and social development. Yet we all know that poverty and inequality
constitute barriers to sustainable development and true democracy.
In order to accelerate economic and social catch-up of his country, the President of Mexico, Vincente
Fox, proposed the establishment of a social fund for development, which would accompany by
financial support government efforts to develop, through investments
structuring (in education, vocational training, infrastructure, etc.) regions
disadvantaged in the country. The Bloc Québécois supports the establishment of such a fund and reiterates
is not to be found in Mexico excluded from free trade and the regions too
lacking infrastructure to attend walk-in North American economy.
Various hypotheses have been advanced to fund this fund: a percentage of GDP each
countries, a percentage of resources from imports and exports,
combination of these two elements or of others.
Recall that the European Union has set a precedent by providing development assistance
for structural member countries whose development suffered some delays, or

for some regions that have proved unable to take advantage of the common market. This
initiative is a success.
In spring 2005, a study group composed mainly of Canadian business people,
United States and Mexico made the same observation and demanded the setting-up of such a fund.
When the government is to the right of the business community, it is a sign that it is isolated.
The Bloc Québécois will continue to press the Canadian government to adopt the principle of
establishment of a social development fund within the NAFTA and the future FTAA.
In addition, the Bloc Québécois considers that a fund of this nature should be part
the future agreement on the Free Trade Area of ​​the Americas, so as to provide support
finance for vocational training, infrastructure development and creation
employment in low-income countries and in designated areas within the different
countries.

Free Trade Canada-Israel
During the last session, the Bloc Québécois tabled a bill that provides that
Canada must begin consultations with the Government of the State of Israel in order to
change the Free Trade Agreement Canada-Israel so that products originating in settlements
population under Israeli administration are subject to the full rate of customs duties
instead of benefiting from the preferential tariff treatment established by the Agreement.

5.4 Protecting cultural diversity
A taste of the sovereign Quebec contribution to the international community
On October 20, 2005, the adoption by an overwhelming majority of countries of the Convention on the Protection of the Diversity of Cultural Contents and Artistic Expressions UNESCO gives
foretaste of what will be the contribution of sovereign Quebec to the international community.
Quebec is indeed the origin of this agreement and its action over the years has been
decisive. This demonstrates that the presence of two countries - Canada and Quebec - at
instead of one on the international stage will be beneficial.
Culture is not a commodity like others
Culture is too closely linked to the identity to be considered a commodity
like the others. It is a reflection of the soul of the people and the imagination of its creators. There
Quebec culture is at the heart of Quebec's difference, desire to live in Quebec
according to his own genius. Cultural differences, different concepts of life and
world, found expression in cultural production, this is great
wealth of humanity called "cultural diversity".
The instruments available to the State to support, promote and protect culture, whether
restrictions on foreign ownership of cultural enterprises, broadcasting quotas
local production, aid of all kinds in the creation, production or distribution,
short full range of tools that we are given to support our culture are
contrary to the rule of non-discrimination which governs trade agreements.
It is absolutely vital that the capacity of the state to support and promote cultural expression
Quebec is fully maintained. Nothing in international trade agreements
must decrease. It is absolutely necessary that the WTO rules are applicable to the culture!
Several countries, the United States in mind, do not see eye to eye and want
Culture is covered, like other economic, trade agreements by sectors
that guarantee access to foreign markets. With exports exceeding $ 100 billion
US, cultural industries (film, television, music, literature and games) is the largest exporter
US, far ahead of the aerospace, automotive and computer equipment. They exercise of
strong pressures to liberalize the cultural sector as liberalized trade
copper. We can not accept that.
For a long time, so that culture is subjected to market rules and
international trade, it would just not discuss it in the WTO. It is no longer enough.
As one liberalizes a growing number of sectors, the risk is great that the measures
support to culture contravene either the WTO rules.

The UNESCO Convention
Where the draft UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Diversity of Cultural Contents
and artistic expression that aims to affirm the right of States to support and protect their
culture. It was essential that this agreement be adopted quickly because the

190

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

this round of WTO negotiations we discussed a variety of topics that may affect
Culture. Similar negotiations are underway in the three Americas in order to create a zone
Free Trade.
You never quite salute the leading role in Quebec and Louise Beaudoin in this
folder. Is Quebec who developed the idea of ​​concluding a convention on diversity
cultural expressions, which convinced the France of the need for such a convention and who
has seized the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. These are Quebec artists, the
actor Pierre Curzi in mind, which were the first to be concerned who have raised
Canadian artists and the rest of the world and have led to the creation of a network of
Coalitions for Cultural Diversity, bringing together creators from around the world.
Through this case, we did get a taste of what Quebec can do on stage
International.
But from the time the case was transferred to UNESCO, Quebec had to disappear and give way to Canada because only sovereign countries can participate in the work of
UNESCO. Minister Pierre Pettigrew refused to let Quebec participate in the negotiations.
This is where the Bloc Quebecois took over. It has intensified the pressure on the government
Federal for that active on the issue of cultural diversity, organized a tour
Quebec to raise awareness of the importance of this issue, organized a meeting between
Representatives of the Coalition for Cultural Diversity and foreign ambassadors
located in Ottawa. Within the federal government, the issue was not a priority and Canada
has been slow to take a position on the most important aspects of the Convention.
Despite this, the Convention was adopted by an overwhelming majority of countries. But it will not come into
force once 30 countries have ratified it. To counter US pressure, it will
important that the countries supporting the Convention encourage other UNESCO members to
ratify quickly. Again, Quebec is at the forefront: it was the first state in the world
accede to the Convention.
The Bloc Québécois will maintain the pressure on the federal government to ratify

5.5 Trade and ethics
The trade is a good thing if accompanied by certain ethical principles.
In this regard, several innovations have emerged in recent years, such as
concepts of responsible investment and trade fair. Moreover, certain practices
among the worst of globalization, including the use of tax havens and pavilions
complacent, are responsible for a leveling down of labor standards, justice
fiscal and environmental responsibility.

FOC
Flags of convenience allow a sea carrier to lower all
standards that would normally be required if it was flying the flag of Canada, for example. That it
provides serious benefits. First, it allows the carrier to subtract
all laws and regulations of the country of origin.
For example, the CSL International vessels flying the flag of Liberia, Barbados or
Bahamas do not have to respect the laws of labor, tax and environmental Canada. They
allow CSL International to pay his crews unacceptable wages in Canada.
Finally, they allow a carrier to evade its responsibilities in case of disaster
environmental.
Ships registered in countries offering flags of convenience are older in
worse condition, their staff is underqualified and exhausted. Their accident rate is 2.7 times
higher than registered boats in other countries, representing losses of goods 6.5 times higher and causing the death of 3.6 times more people. Multiplication
we are exposed to environmental disasters and may cause the disappearance of trade
Marine in countries where there are minimum labor standards.
The carelessness of the government has resulted in the number of vessels flying the flag
complacency is rising sharply in Canada. They went from 15% to 28% between 1985 and
1999. Since 2000, they represent the majority of the total tonnage of ocean-going ships
serving the ports of Canada, an increase of 148% in fifteen years.
The Bloc Québécois will continue to combat the use of flags of convenience and
urge the government to ratify the United Nations Convention on Conditions
registration of vessels that seeks to limit the importance of flags of convenience.

Fair Trade
The objective of fair trade is to promote sustainable development through trade relations based on justice and respect for the environment in a
perspective that allows the autonomy of Southern economies. To meet the criteria of
fair trade, production methods must be environmentally and
democratically managed organizations. Purchase must be made as directly
possible to avoid speculation and the intermediaries who too often engulf producers and consumers.

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

Fair trade begins to develop in Quebec and in Canada, particularly
in the field of coffee. For the products of fairer trade really take the place they deserve, will require the commitment of governments and strengthening
certain existing structures. CIDA, for example, could focus on the development of
fair trade by assigning it a part of its resources.
Each year, the federal government invests millions of dollars for the representation
commercial initiatives around the world. For cons, the contracts that our drop
Companies do not always respect the principles of sustainable development. Resource
absolutely must be invested in a trade respecting workers and the environment to take its place in all sectors. The Bloc Québécois has obtained during its
last mandate set by Parliament to serve only fair trade coffee. We must now go further.
The Bloc Québécois proposes that the federal government to require all its agencies
and ministries to serve only fair trade coffee, where he has the opportunity.

Promoting responsible investment: do you know how is your pension fund?
Pension plans with assets of nearly $ 600 billion, are major players
in the financial world. If pension funds took into account ethical criteria in their
investments here and abroad, companies that use their savings would also
to reflect this.
Currently, there is no incentive for pension fund managers to consider other criteria
as financial or even to inform their members of their investment strategy. The block
Quebec introduced bills to force pension fund managers to do
report annually on social considerations, ethical and environmental factors they
reflected in their management, considering that this transparency will encourage them to adopt a more socially responsible behavior. The Bloc Québécois agrees to return to the load
the next term.

Supervise the activities of Canadian companies abroad
Until recently, it was unlikely that the presence of Canada or a Canadian company abroad is significant enough to cause a conflict or disaster. This
past is over. Investment by Canadian companies abroad were multiplied
five between 1990 and 2004, reaching $ 440 billion.
In recent years, an Alberta oil company has been accused of supporting and financing
the government camp in the war in Sudan. Six mining companies in British Columbia
have been singled out by the UN because their activities were financing the war in the Republic
Republic of the Congo. A mining company is part of a consortium with the military junta
Burma and other causes of forced population displacement in the Philippines.

The federal government does not even have legislative tools to regulate the activities of
Canadian companies abroad and refuses to give. In fall 2005, the Subcommittee
Human Rights produced a damning report on corporate behavior
Canadian mining companies abroad. The government has refused to act on it.
The Bloc Québécois has already filed a bill to allow Ottawa to prevent
company to pursue activities that cause conflicts or human rights violations
the person abroad. He agrees to do it again in his next term.

5.6 The Canadian military:
for strengthening peace missions
The Bloc Québécois notes that the defense budget increased considerably since
1997-1998. Moreover, in the last budget, we announced the largest increase of twenty
last years.
For a long time, no clear policy framed these expenses. Recently, the government announced the filing of its new foreign policy and defense. Sadly,
the filing of the new policy was just a public relations exercise to try to
divert attention from the sponsorship scandal. The document is so badly put together that
is probably a draft, published in haste. It offers no guidance, no
choice of what will be the mission of the Army and is still proposes spending all directions
that characterized the actions of the ministry in recent years.

Spending up sharply but none Airplane
In five years, from 1996-1997 to 2003-2004, the budget of the Armed Forces increased from 8.4 to
$ 12.5 billion, an increase of 47.9%.

However, in the absence of clear and focused direction, several of expenditure without debate or
reflection proved to be pure waste. Here are some examples that have drawn attention

• the purchase of submarines for $ 800 million appears to us today as
a madness;
• a system of satellite communications $ 174 million that has never left the

offers, aircraft at a cost estimated at $ 12 billion.

That is why the Bloc Quebecois demands that the federal government introduce to the Standing Committee
defense, to study any proposed purchase of military equipment over
$ 100 million before.
The Bloc Québécois obviously does not dispute certain increases in the military budget, particularly in regard to the living conditions of the military. In a recent report, note that
Forces Ombudsman notes the existence of systemic problems regarding syndrome
post-traumatic stress. Moreover we support fully the report's recommendations
the Standing Committee of the Defense Forces Readiness (May 2002) that affect
improvements to living conditions of soldiers.
The Bloc Québécois asked that the grievance process be modified to meet
adequately to complaints by the military.

Peace missions: the primary role of the army
Canada lack of staff and adequate facilities to carry out peacekeeping missions
But why it has a long tradition and good expertise.
The Bloc Québécois, in line with the aspirations of Quebecers, proposed
the priority mission of the Armed Forces is participation in international missions
peace. Canada, with a tradition dating back to the fifties, has expertise
in the field. It could contribute much more to peacekeeping missions and
conflict mitigation, in the spirit of the UN Charter. Investments
military should mainly be carried out to fulfill this priority mission.
Obviously submarine legacy of the Cold War did not belong.
But it is just the opposite happened. The first priority of the Ministry of Defence when
he purchases is to ensure that its equipment can be compatible
with those of the US for the Canadian military can work more closely with the
country in their own way and according to their worldview. We are far from peace!
The government had already given a mandate to the Armed Forces they struggled to fill:
they were to remain combat capable in the defense of the territory and maintain their ability
to contribute to peace and international security. Over the years, steering clear of fault,
Canada has become a marginal player in its involvement in efforts to maintain peace
UN. The new defense policy, always giving no guidance, let to believe
that marginalization will continue and that during this time the Ministry of Defence
continue to spend fortunes for technological wonders whose necessity is far
to be demonstrated.
This view is reinforced by the fact that consultations at the Defence Committee are
superficial and fall over the diversionary tactic than a genuine desire to absorb the
democratic deficit in Parliament.

ELECTION PLATFORM | CAMPAIGN 2005-2006

The Bloc Québécois is asking the government to hold hearings on its real
foreign and defense policy and intends to propose to the peacekeeping mission
are clearly identified as the priority of the army.

Post-traumatic stress syndrome
The syndrome of post-traumatic stress is a form of psychological distress affecting
People who have witnessed unsustainable or events that have been placed in situations
extended voltage. Among the possible consequences include the development of
angry behavior, isolation and less commonly, suicide.
Up to 50% of the soldiers participating in challenging missions can suffer sequelae
Psychological upon return while one in five will suffer post-traumatic stress disorder. However, the situation is less likely to degenerate if adequate care is
provided quickly.
Yet the military, instead of providing psychological help to the military, minimize
or deny the problem. So Forces Ombudsman is concerned that many military
do not get the care they need. The Bloc Québécois finds it unacceptable that the federal government refuses to take humane measures to help people
risk their lives to defend fundamental values.
This is unacceptable and the Bloc Québécois intends to lobby so that we
do not abandon the military return of difficult missions.

Agent Orange
The application of defoliants in Gagetown military base caused a variety of diseases
especially in the military than among civilians. Long ago, the Ministry of Defence tried to
minimize the situation before acknowledging his responsibility.
Following pressure, the federal government has set up an investigative process.
However, the Bloc Québécois will ensure that the military and civilian victims are promptly
and fairly compensated.

A lump sum for reservists
Since 1 April 1997, the government provides reservists who leave the Armed Forces
a lump sum departure, based on the number of years of service. In so doing,
government forgets all those who left the service between that date and April 1
1992 when this measure was first submitted to the Treasury Board. By
In fairness, the Bloc Quebecois asked the government to recognize the effort made by the
Reservists who left the military between the two dates by paying them an allowance
equivalent departure.

CHAPTER VI - FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK
The financial framework of the Bloc Québécois expects balanced budgets and focuses on the three
next financial years (2006-2007 to 2008-2009).
During this period, the financial leeway the federal government will rise
cumulatively to $ 64.8 billion, the $ 41.6 billion surplus reported in the Last
day of November and $ 23.2 billion from proposed tax and budget changes
the Bloc Quebecois.
The Bloc Québécois proposes a set of tax and spending initiatives totaling
$ 55.8 billion.
A reserve of $ 3 billion per year has been set aside for contingencies.
The financial framework does not take account of the initiatives announced in the Economic Update
financial and presented November 14, 2005, except with regard to tax cuts
we have incorporated into our proposals.

Ventilation proposals of the Bloc Québécois
In total, the Bloc Québécois proposes that 26.8% of new initiatives are devoted to
transfers to Quebec and the provinces for postsecondary education and for others
social programs, and equalization; 21.3% tax credit for family,
social housing and employment insurance. Tax cuts that were announced in

Investments of $ 2.3 billion over three years in the restoration of a program
municipal and strategic infrastructures are considered assets
imputed debt, which involves spending $ 234 million per year. This approach
is in accordance with the new accounting rules of the federal government. Moreover, beyond what is allowed under the financial framework, the amounts necessary to repay the Supplement
Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) could be drawn from the contingency reserve.

The financial leeway of Ottawa
For many years, the federal government suggested that it had
no margin for maneuver and continued to deny the existence of the fiscal imbalance. However, in
recent update, he finally admitted that he had substantial surplus, that surplus
estimated at $ 41.6 billion for the next three years. The various measures proposed
the Bloc Québécois will expand this scope to a total of
$ 64.8 billion over three years.
Budgetary surplus of $ 41.6 billion
The 2005-2006 fiscal year is not yet closed but the federal government has revised
forecasts increase its surplus in the Economic and Fiscal Update 2005.
Thus, it will benefit surplus of $ 11.2 billion for 2005-2006. For three years
following the forecasts indicate total budget surplus of $ 41.6 billion.

Canada which were published in the Economic and Fiscal Update 2005. These financial projections were made by averaging the economic forecasts four

2007-2008 and 3.2% in 2008-2009. Note that these revenue projections are conservative.

Expenses
The expenses of this year were based on the 2005 budget and all budgetary initiatives adopted by the House of Commons, until 14 November 2005.
The 2005 update states that spending growth for 2006-2007 will be 4.9%
while for the years 2007-2008 and 2008-2009, it will be 4.5% and 4.6% respectively.

The debt service
To forecast expenditures to be incurred by the debt service, the Bloc Québécois
was based on the estimates of the Ministry of Finance in its most recent update, and
although the federal government has overestimated the cost of debt.
The changes proposed by the Bloc Québécois
The Bloc Québécois proposes several changes to reduce government spending and increase revenues. These measures, combined with budget surpluses would allow the federal government to have total leeway of $ 64.8 billion
over the next three years.

that the committee has shown that spending federal operation have

Gradually, over the fiscal years 2006-2007 and 2007-2008. As for the figure
$ 6 billion, it is based on a report of the Auditor General published in September 2004
indicating that at March 31, 2004, the balance of the foundations was $ 7.7 billion. Since then, it is
likely that some foundations have experienced a decline in their assets (certain commitments
having been honored). We estimate that $ 6 billion could be repatriated coffers
government within three years.
Fiscal and budgetary measures
The Bloc Québécois proposes three tax changes and budget which will have the effect of
generate more than $ billion annually:
• new surtax applicable only to big oil companies would increase from
4% to 12%. Thus, the tax rate on the profits of major oil pass
29.12% to 31.36%. This is to bring in about $ 500 million more
year under current tax rules;
• the elimination of budget support measures to Atomic Energy Canada evaluated
$ 163 million by année73;
• Finally, changing the rules and the revision of tax treaties in order
end the use of tax havens allow minimum tax receipts
$ 1.85 billion in three years. According to Statistics Canada, Canadian investment
Barbados grew on average by 21.3% per year between 2000 and 2004. It is
therefore no exaggeration to think that the federal government could recover this amount.
Recall that in his December 2002 report, the Auditor General wrote:
"According to information we have obtained from the Canada Customs and Revenue
Canada, Canadian companies received in 2000, their affiliates to
Barbados, $ 1.5 billion in dividends virtually tax exempt (compared to $ 400 million in 1990). "

73 For 2004-2005, the funding for Atomic Energy of Canada was $ 162.8 million. This amount comes from the Main Estimates
expenses as well as Supplementary Estimates A and B for 2004-2005.
