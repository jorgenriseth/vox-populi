III.X. MACRO-ECONOMIC POLICY
In the field of macroeconomics, we will adopt compliance
unequivocal commitments of the macro tripod: the inflation target, ie,
in the center of the target, primary surplus obtained without accounting gimmicks and
floating exchange rate. The ultimate goal is to create an environment in Brazil
less uncertainty and increased security, compatible with real interest rates and
rated significantly lower than current and consistent with
the historical average of the most advanced countries. This is a condition
We needed to either embark on an accelerated path
convergence to better living standards in the world.
GUIDELINES:
1.

Operational autonomy to the Central Bank, which will lead to the inflation rate
target of 4.5% per year. Once reached, the target will be reduced
Gradually, as the fluctuation band, currently more or
least 2%. The central bank should also smooth fluctuations
economic cycle and ensure the financial stability.

2.

Generating a primary surplus sufficient to gradually reduce
the net and gross debt compared to GDP. This surplus can
be adjusted to reflect the cyclical movement of the economy.

It is an absolute necessity for construction of a system
robust macroeconomic. More than that, it is also a condition
basic to the functioning of a democracy, which does not allow spaces

4.

Creating legal security environment, with respect to contracts, and

5.

Painstaking effort of monitoring and evaluation of public spending, which

III.XI. SOCIAL SECURITY
Demographic changes are at the root of the imbalances of our
pension system, which is structured on the principle
breakdown. In this system, the economically active generation finances
benefits of the generation that has withdrawn from the market. The focus is on improving
actuarial balance of the accounts of the general social security scheme.

GUIDELINES:
1.

The first confrontation of the social security deficit will occur by increasing
Sustained economic activity. The return of growth based on
private sector activity will be important factor to lessen the spread of
deficit of social security, this will result in revenue growth more
that proportional to spending.

Brazil is a country of high tax burden to its current level
development. We have a tax burden of 36% of GDP in a country
with GDP per capita of US $ 24,000. In general, countries with tax burden
similar to ours have a GDP per capita almost three times higher.
45

Thus increasing the tax burden is no longer a viable option for the
financing of public policies, but there is room for improvement
substantial in our tax system, which is extremely complex and
distorted. An example is the large number of taxes and contributions,
that greatly increase red tape and the cost of companies. According
to World Bank data, companies in Brazil take on average
about 2,600 hours to comply with their tax obligations, compared
an average of only 366 hours for all the countries of Latin America and
Caribbean. So you can move quickly in the strong reduction
number of taxes and contributions.

social inclusion in Brazil's history.
When Federal Manager, the PSDB has enabled the NHS through various
important actions, such as the decentralization of management and financing
of federal funds to states and municipalities, starting the

The health sector in the last 12 years was the one that received less
attention on the social security budget, from R $ 20.3 billion
in 2000 to R $ 78.6 billion in 2012 (209% increase). For
comply with the provisions of the 1988 Constitution relating to health, it would be
required much more than the federal government has devoted to
sector.
If the financing of SUS by the Federal Government did not increase
significantly, it is increasing the participation of states and municipalities,
which now represent over 50% of public health expenditures. But
even with this participation, public resources are not enough
to honor all these challenges. According to the World Health Organization
Health -OMs, countries in 2010 allocated on average 5.4% of GDP
public spending on health, and OECD countries, 7.6%. The Brazil allocated
only 4.1%. If you were to spend the same percentage of GDP than the average
