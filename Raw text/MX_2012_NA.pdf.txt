The competitiveness and productivity of Mexico are essential to achieve and ensure the development and welfare of

These days, at the major strategy and public policy decision globally, it is recognized that
education and training are essential for growth and economic development (OECD, 2010). It's about a
new paradigm, intellectual and political, coupled with the age
of globalization, for the period of the late
twentieth century and the beginning of the current (1990-2010). From this
approach, education has been incorporated as a strategic indicator variable and the capitalist processes

Actually, it is a complex web of factors that works
interdependently what best explains the high performance and stories of success or failure of any education system. According to what was observed in several countries

on the structure of relations among members of

To own capital, a person must relate to others. At the family level, different elements, mainly those related to the care of their parents

In schools, social capital may be associated with the quality of relationships, formal and informal, between teachers

in emerging countries like Mexico, where resources are
