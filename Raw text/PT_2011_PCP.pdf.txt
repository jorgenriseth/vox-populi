Introduction
In the electoral program presented by the CFP the 2009 legislative elections, were recorded,
the consequences of four and half years of PS government and the implementation of a policy
right that benefited, in its fundamental issues even in a majority situation
absolute, and the complicity of the PSD and the CDS support.
The extremely serious situation that the country now lives is the result of the worsening in the context of the crisis
of capitalism and capitalist integration process of the EU, the policy of the consequences
right, fueled by the growing alienation of national sovereignty and submission to
large capital guidelines. In the last year and a half, with the combined support of PS,
PSD and CDS have been taken and new restrictive measures, particularly in PEC and
Budgets for 2010 and 2011.
The June 5 election, called following the resignation of the Government and the
dissolution of Parliament, artificially justified the rejection of PEC IV -
PSD and CDS whose content actually support - but actually translating a deep
political and social wear the Government and its policy are thus a political battle that
arises, decisively, the issue of disruption and change to a policy
patriotic and left.
In 2009, the PCP pointed out the indispensability of a patriotic rupture and left as
indispensable way to solving the country's problems. Less than two years later,
the need remains and is accentuated. Had the set of measures proposed by the
PCP been applied and the country would not be plunged into deep crisis in which
found.
The PCP reaffirms the timeliness of the electoral program of 2009 and the measures contained therein,
presenting simultaneously this "Commitment to a patriotic policy and
left ", which points Reasons and Solutions to six key issues -
financing and debt, national production, labor and social rights, distribution of wealth,
national sovereignty, democracy and rights - and the proposal of an alternative, a political and
a Patriotic Government and Left.

1. Questions of funding and
debt
http://www.cdu.pt/2011/compromisso-eleitoral-do-pcp-por-uma-pol%C3%ADtica-
Patriotic% C3% B3tica-and-of-left

1.1 External debt and the financing of the Portuguese State
The country's foreign debt is one of the most visible consequences of the policy
national disaster PS, PSD and CDS / PP imposed over the last 35 years, with the
deepening of external dependence and subordination to the interests and strategies of
big business and financial monopolists. It is inseparable, in size
structural, a national production abandonment process of privatization,
submission to the dictates of the EU and accession to the Euro, with the consequent loss
competitiveness and conditioning state funding, leaving power issue
currency exchange rate to fix and determine interest rates and shall exclusively on hand
the "market".
Net debt, public (state) and private (Companies and Individuals), which now takes the
colossal size of more than 107% of the GDP in the private component was always
superior, and that does not result from an excess of public expenditure (subject to the necessary
rationalization of superfluous expenses), but before an unfair tax and contribution policy,
We charge a lot for workers and pensioners and little to economic groups and
financial. It's not the people who live "beyond their means", but the financial oligarchy
which appropriates high profits and dividends.
After 2008 and the deepening structural crisis of capitalism, worsened the debt,
result of the recession due to the lack of measures to support the real economy,
speculation on interest rates on government securities - which adds to all
EUR million months (more than 1 900 million euros from 2010 to 2011) - ensuring
any significance profits to the banks of Germany, England, Spain, the Netherlands, France and
Also in Portugal, which are financed from the ECB at 1% rate, and then purchase
public debt charging 8%, 9% and up over 10% on an illegitimate usurpation of resources
nationals.
Worsened further and in particular the assumption of costs by the State of "toxic waste" and
holes of the financial sector and the measures to support the banking assumed from 2008
that committed many billions of euros and that in cases of BPN and BPP
already reach 2250 million insured euros so far, transforming private debt
in public, with the transfer of costs to workers and the people.

1.2. The blackmail and interference of so-called 'foreign aid'
The workers, the people and the country are subject to an unacceptable ultimatum and political
blackmail to accept a brutal economic and social regression!
The European Union, taking the views and policies of the IMF and revealing its nature
political and economic dominance in the service of big capital, seeks to protect the interests

http://www.cdu.pt/2011/compromisso-eleitoral-do-pcp-por-uma-pol%C3%ADtica-
Patriotic% C3% B3tica-and-of-left

the financial capital of the great powers and their banks, refusing to intervene to halt
speculation, with devastating consequences already visible in Greece and in Ireland
(recession, rising interest rates, unemployment and injustice).
The measures imposed by PS and PSD and CDS, in successive PEC and State Budgets
far from containing speculation or "calm down the markets" are, conversely, its
recessionary effect, an increase factor of interest rates charged, in a spiral
speculative ever stop while blackmailed give in to blackmail.
Contrary to what we repeatedly said, the government eventually request the intervention of the IMF,
bowing to pressure - internal and external - and the requirement of national banks, receiving
any significance support and public benefits - while heavily penalized
productive sectors and small businesses - seeks to continue to profit from speculation
financial.
Facilitating the government and the IMF task, it can be said that PS, PSD and CDS subscribe one
common electoral program: the PEC IV enlarged and aggravated by accepting the external imposition of
an economic and social program that had been rejected in parliament.
They are already envisage, for external intervention program, new support to the financial sector
and large domestic and foreign capital, with the direct delivery of a thick slice of
loan contract, and the prospect of seizing, through an extensive program
privatization of what remains of strategic sectors and the resources of the country.
The PCP does not abdicate the national independence and sovereignty, refusing a policy of
austerity for the workers and the people, and enrichment of the capitalists. The country
needs an alternative policy towards the development and growth
economic, refusing to recession, massive unemployment, rising inequality and
impoverishment of the Portuguese.

1.3 An urgent and different answer: a debt renegotiation
Given the unsustainable situation that is created, and its possible developments in
near future, the PCP considers that the Portuguese State should take, breaking with the
current policy, the following positions:
The immediate renegotiation of the Portuguese public debt - with the revaluation of deadlines, the
interest rates and the amounts to be paid - to relieve the state of weight and effort
debt service, channeling resources to the promotion of productive investment, creation
employment and other needs of the country. This decision, conditioning right from the
payment of the short-term commitments of public debt and taking other
measures - for example, the transformation of external loans of public entities,
expressed in bonds and long-term debt securities in Portuguese bonds - would

http://www.cdu.pt/2011/compromisso-eleitoral-do-pcp-por-uma-pol%C3%ADtica-
Patriotic% C3% B3tica-and-of-left

responding to concerns about financing difficulties / immediate liquidity
State!
The intervention from other countries that face similar debt problems
public - Greece, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Belgium, etc. - In order for convergent action
stop the current speculative spiral, together with measures to release the countries
target of unacceptable constraints and policies of the Economic and Monetary Union and the Bank
European Central Bank, Economic Governance and the Euro Plus Pact, and aim at
economic growth, job creation and improvement of wages.
The diversification of funding sources, resuming an active policy of emission
Savings Certificates and Treasury and other appropriate instruments to capture
national savings, as well as the development of bilateral relations, finding ways
more advantageous financing. A diversification policy also relations
commercial, mutually beneficial, with other countries, particularly in Africa, Asia and
Latin America.

2.
Portugal
The
to produce,
more
economic growth, more jobs
Breaking with a policy linked to the interests of economic and financial groups,
PCP considers that economic policy should affirm the strategic value of national production
and harness the potential of the country, to ensure sustainable economic growth,
job creation, combating addiction and external debt reduction and
elimination of structural deficits in food, energy, industrial and technological plan, and
assertion of a sovereign path of development. The focus on domestic production and
Economic growth is also the fastest and lasting way to increase revenues
State, and halt and reduce the foreign debt.
Within this framework, together with the reconsideration of Community economic framework
Portuguese, a budget management frees the SGP, the sustainability of public finances
in the medium and long term and urgent restructuring of our debt, it is necessary
recover the main instruments of economic sovereignty.
The PCP proposes a defense policy and promotion of national production, with a program
industrialization of the country, promoting all national resources, that has as axes
Essential:
- Strengthening public investment, focused on industry, agriculture and fisheries,
for the creation and recovery infrastructure necessary for production as well as for

http://www.cdu.pt/2011/compromisso-eleitoral-do-pcp-por-uma-pol%C3%ADtica-
Patriotic% C3% B3tica-and-of-left

transport network and logistics; a policy that targets the import substitution by
domestic production, together with the development of exports, an expansion frame and
diversification of external relations; that in the field of trade rules at Community level
take action, even if transient, in support of the exported goods and penalty
of imports.
- Integrated Use of all national resources, policies that: (i)
realizing measures to combat unemployment, precarious work, the devaluation of
wages, the deregulation of working hours, to promote the use of more
important national potential - the creativity and productivity of millions of workers;
(ii) promote the important natural resources of the subsoil and energy, agriculture and forestry,
the resources of the sea as well as the entire productive capacity already installed in our country -
particularly in the industrial plan.
- Defense and reconstitution of a strong and dynamic State Business Sector,
recovering for the public sector basic and strategic sectors of our economy,
namely in banking, energy, telecommunications and transport, stimulating
other important sectors that are today or deeply vulnerable or subject to logical
short-term financial, or even abandoned, and the affirmation of Planning
Economic, as the Constitution provides, necessary to restructure the
productive fabric.
- A strong focus on micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) and the dynamism and
defense of the internal market by improving the workers' purchasing power and
pensioners, through an appropriate policy to support investment, with full employment of
NSRF, PRODER and PROMAR and the urgent amendment of the rules of national contributions
for projects financed with EU funds (ensuring a significant reduction
of these payments), with freed markets of choking and predation sector
monopolists of non-tradable goods and services (credit, insurance, energy,
telecommunications, retail outlets, tolls, etc.), ensuring input prices
production to ensure the competitiveness of domestic production.

3. Social and Labour Rights
3.1 Workers' rights

http://www.cdu.pt/2011/compromisso-eleitoral-do-pcp-por-uma-pol%C3%ADtica-
Patriotic% C3% B3tica-and-of-left

Unemployment is today one of the most serious national problems, reaching more than 800 000
workers, a situation that will worsen if the measures provided for PEC IV are applied
and recommended by the IMF, with the support of PS, PSD and CDS.
The offensive frame to make it even more unfair ownership by big capital
wealth produced, the right policy seeks to transform the price of the workforce - the
wages - the only adjustment variable of the Portuguese economy.
Unemployment is thus the most powerful pressure factor for the low wages and
liquidation rights, boosted further by restricting access to unemployment benefits and
Social unemployment, applied by the government with the explicit or implicit support of the PSD and
CDS, leaving hundreds of thousands of unemployed workers without support and
conditioned on acceptance of ever lower wages.
In the same vein of lower wages and increased exploitation, continues the attack on
labor law, as practiced with the Labour Code PSD / CDS, and its revision for the worse
by PS, which now moves to new stage, from the PEC IV, directed to facilitating
dismissals - the process and the drastic reduction of damages due to
workers - to the attack on collective bargaining and action of trade unions in negotiating
and the degradation of rights to schedules and mobility.
At the same time, it increases the precariousness of labor relations, in particular to young people
workers (including qualified young people, also, incidentally, hit hard by
unemployment) and new generations, with the use of fixed-term contracts, work
temporary, internships and false green receipts as a way to fill jobs
without permanent matches them with appropriate contract and likewise opens
way to lower returns.
The country needs a policy that values ​​the right to constitutionally guaranteed work
and ensure development for workers:
- Through a job creation policy inseparable from economic growth;
- The respect of working hours (daily and weekly) and the progressive reduction of its
duration;
- On the fight against precariousness and employment with rights;
- Revoking the most onerous provisions of the Labour Code and rejecting the new offensive
provided for in PEC IV and proposed by the IMF / EU, agreed by the government with organizations
employers and the UGT, with the support of PSD and CDS;
- Widening the access criteria to unemployment benefit and social allowance
unemployment.

3.2. Social rights
http://www.cdu.pt/2011/compromisso-eleitoral-do-pcp-por-uma-pol%C3%ADtica-
Patriotic% C3% B3tica-and-of-left

The right policy PS government has resulted also in most cases with
PSD and CDS support, on penalty of access to social benefits, imposing criteria
socially unjust, which resulted in the exclusion of hundreds of thousands of
supports such as child benefit, solidarity supplement for the elderly, social income
insertion, scholarships and school support, among others.
Simultaneously are severely diminished other social restraints if the reimbursement
of drugs or transportation of patients, being increasingly difficult access to
health care, education and social action.
The PCP called for a policy to extend access to social support to children, young people
and the most needy sectors of the population by repealing the unjust and artificial criteria
excluding taxes in recent years. A policy that guarantees all the Portuguese
provision of quality public services.

4. A fairer distribution of
wealth
The right-wing policies of the last decades has highlighted the injustice in the distribution of wealth
national, together with its increasing transfer abroad through
profits and interest, evident in the increase of the difference between GDP and Income
Gross National.
This increase has the essential matrix decreased wealth of the portion attributed to
wages, with the corresponding weight of greater profits, in addition to penalizing
annuities and pensions and a substantial decrease in social support, with a decrease
clear the redistributive function of social security.
At the same time, the income of small businesses decreased (farmers, fishermen,
traders), subject to predation in the retail industry, the cost of inputs
(credit, energy, communications) imposed by the monopoly groups that dominate them, and
a tax code that discriminates.
There was a very strong attack on wages in public administration and Corporate Sector
the State, through its real and nominal cut decrease in 2011, as well as in sector
private, using the pressure of unemployment, the reduction of rights and the precarious. To
same time, there is a strong penalty of pensions and retirement, with its successive
actual decline and its freezing in 2011.
However, it increased the tax burden on workers and pensioners, either through
IRS either by increasing the VAT, while kept large benefits

http://www.cdu.pt/2011/compromisso-eleitoral-do-pcp-por-uma-pol%C3%ADtica-
Patriotic% C3% B3tica-and-of-left

for big business and the financial sector. Remember that in 2010 the bank
maintained the 2009 profit level and prepares to pay half of the taxes, which several
companies - namely PT - anticipated dividend distribution to escape
paying taxes. Remember though that remain free in corporate income tax, capital gains
Furniture of SGPS or investment funds, which all operations in the market
Fellow continue without any taxation, the almost non-existent taxation of
transfers to tax havens or any business in the free zone
Wood, continue to be the rule. As well as other economic and social damage,
privatizations have been translated in a loss of revenue for the state, not only in terms of
dividends, as particularly the taxes paid by these companies.
State resources continue however to be increasingly drained for groups
private economic, through various means, as are the public-private partnerships -
whose contracts must be renegotiated or terminated - as well as concessions and other
Delivery forms of public service installments, and its finance sector
private.
The country needs a fairer distribution of wealth based on three issues
fundamental:
- The increase in wages and pensions and reforms, including the minimum wage to 600
euros in 2013, and the actual increase in pensions not less than EUR 25 in the lower, as
indispensable tool for fairer distribution of wealth, but also the
boosting domestic consumption and thus for economic growth.
- A tax reform to ease taxation, direct and indirect workers,
pensioners and micro and small businesses and, simultaneously, promote fair taxation
of big profits, especially with the elimination of tax benefits, taxation
plus companies and economic groups with profits in excess of 50 million euros,
IRC effective taxation in the banking and financial sector with the value of the nominal rate and the
capital gains of SGPS and investment funds, increased taxation of large fortunes,
heritage and luxury goods, taxing stock trades and transfers
to tax havens and the taxation of capital gains resulting from the processing of
use of the soil.
- A social policy that gives priority to combating poverty and exclusion, widening access
social benefits and increasing its value also contributing in this way for a
fairer distribution of wealth, to enter benefits awarded in programs
social inclusion and the labor market, combating stigmatization of people
benefiting from them, as well as the perpetuation of deprivation, which provides on
simultaneously effective supervision of authorized services.

5. Defence of national sovereignty
The crisis in Portugal, included in the framework of deepening structural crisis of capitalism the
Worldwide, the sharpening of the class struggle that characterizes it entails a strong offensive
against national sovereignty in order to condemn our country to dependence and subordination
against the big business and the European Union.
Recent developments of the capitalist integration process of the European Union
They revealed more clearly to their class nature, confirming it as an instrument
central domain and the joint of the big European capital - especially the great
financial capital - as well as the institutions and political forces at your service, used to,
a process of concentration of economic and political power, direct to classes
most disadvantaged and the most vulnerable and least developed countries the effects of
crisis at the expense of national resources and the destruction of productive tissues.
As the PCP warned, Euro, Economic and Monetary Union and the European Union is a
problem and an obstacle to the sovereign development of Portugal and living conditions of
Portuguese. Twenty five years of integration of Portugal in the EEC and the EU extended the
problems and weaknesses of the national economy, stressing their dependence and deficits
structural.
The complete submission of the Portuguese Government to NATO (visible at the recent summit in Lisbon) and
the increasing involvement of Portugal in the projects of European imperialist militarism and North American, confirm the direction of a waiver of sovereign foreign policy intervention and
according to the Constitution, towards peace and cooperation among peoples.
Portugal is not doomed to submission and dependence! The patriotic policy and left
part of the central idea that national sovereignty does not negotiate, sell or cede, lies in
people and it is to him that belongs to the decision of its present and future collective.
Portugal has competitive advantages, historical and cultural ties and a situation
geostrategic, which enable the development of a foreign policy that defends
legitimate interests of Portugal and the Portuguese, and contribute to its prestige
International.
A policy based on the use of national resources and to recover the instruments
political and economic that are prerequisites to the development of Portugal,
economic and monetary terms, trade relations and industry development
productive.
A policy that, in the EU plan, reject the imposition of Community policies
harmful to the national interest, guaranteeing the Portuguese people the right to decide on the
European integration process, and promote the building in Europe of a real
process of cooperation between sovereign states with equal rights and duties.

http://www.cdu.pt/2011/compromisso-eleitoral-do-pcp-por-uma-pol%C3%ADtica-
Patriotic% C3% B3tica-and-of-left

A foreign policy that rejects unilateralism that respects the Constitution and defend the
right of peoples to sovereignty, self-determination and territorial integrity, rejecting the
UN exploitation. A foreign policy and defense, while respecting the rights and
dignity of the Portuguese military, whose fundamental mission at the service of
Portugal and sovereignty, opposing any act of interference and external aggression, and
to decide on the return of all military personnel in military missions abroad.
A policy based on diversification of economic and financial relations with the most
number of world countries, who reject the liberalization of world trade, defend relations
cooperation and mutually beneficial economic support, fight for effective regulation of
financial markets, the taxation of all financial transactions by the end of havens
tax, the penalty relocation of companies and the right of all peoples to
their economic and social development.
A policy which, while respecting the United Nations Charter, defend the dissolution of the blocks
politico-military and decide the untying of Portugal's military structure of NATO, which
opposed to militarism a project of international cooperation for peace and disarmament.

6. Defend the Constitution and the regime
democratic
This year and a half period that elapses between the 2009 elections and the upcoming parliamentary
of 5 June, the citizens, the Portuguese people saw worsen all aspects of the situation
economic and social development of the country, with profoundly negative consequences on developments
policy. By default and in most cases, against the Constitution, have widened
lines and lines of action that, coming from behind, correspond to new heights on the offensive
against the democratic regime, subject to new and increased dangers and threats.
In view of the gravity of the situation of the country and the life of the Portuguese, are accentuated lines
discredit the institutions of democracy, in particular the Assembly
Republic, trying to hide the real reasons, managers and beneficiaries of the crisis -
right policy and its executors, at the service of monopoly capital - further a
equalization line of "political" and parties, which aims to hide the distinction between those who
implement and support the negative measures and the challenge by offering alternatives such as
does the PCP.
Thus, the current situation can be characterized in the following aspects most relevant:
Degradation of political democracy, with the spread of corruption and trafficking in
influences, unfulfilled promises, lack of transparency, blackmail, lies and

http://www.cdu.pt/2011/compromisso-eleitoral-do-pcp-por-uma-pol%C3%ADtica-
Patriotic% C3% B3tica-and-of-left

anything goes in political life, reaching unprecedented levels, unacceptable and incompatible with the
democratic regime.
Total subordination of the leaders of right-wing politics to high finance interests and
economic power, evident in the activities, shameless and unacceptable, the principals of
Banking regarding the state budget and the intervention of the IMF / EU in our country.
Growing offensive against the rights and freedoms of citizens, settlement
workers' rights, limitations and undemocratic violations of pluralism and freedom
of political expression, with emphasis policies, methods and security-oriented performances and
repressive.
Insistence on legislative measures, along with continued pressure and interference in power
judicial, which call into question not only the independence of courts and judges and
principle of separation of powers, as compromise the realization of justice, especially in
cases of more serious crime.
Continuing high levels of crime and growing sense of insecurity
populations, caused by the decrease of public policies to prevent delinquency and
crime.
Economists measures dictated by the obsession deficit, reaching core areas of
State, such as justice and public safety, and that, along with the breakdown of the status and
just demands of the workers, undermine the normal functioning of
courts and security forces and services, and reach the right of access to justice,
security and public tranquility.
Constant failure and disregard for the Constitution, accompanied by new offensive,
with the opening of a review process, which aims at the destruction of historic achievements
April such as public schools, the national health service and dismissals without just
question.
For the CFP, the defense of democracy and freedoms, based on the principles of the regime
democratic won with April, they are an integral part of building a political
Alternatively, patriotic and left.
A defense policy and strengthening of April democracy depends on respect for and enforcement of
Constitution of the Republic, the deepening of the rights, freedoms and guarantees
fundamental and strengthening the involvement of citizens in political life; respect for
separation of powers and organizational autonomy and functioning of political parties;
the democratic and proportionality of electoral systems; an independent judiciary,
democratic and accessible to all; combat and punishment of corruption, economic crime and trafficking
influences; security policy one that defends the rights of citizens and the
public peace; a national defense policy and military service of the country.

http://www.cdu.pt/2011/compromisso-eleitoral-do-pcp-por-uma-pol%C3%ADtica-
Patriotic% C3% B3tica-and-of-left

Crucial issue for the defense of the democratic system is the effective subordination of power
economic to political power.

A patriotic government and leftist
The completion of the necessary political resolution of national problems requires training
a patriotic and left government, able to secure a new phase of life of the country,
marked by the development, justice and social progress.
A government to save the country, guided by a patriotic and left policy that,
corresponding to the content and the Constitution of the eigenvalues ​​of the Republic and the ideals of
April, allows responding to national problems, as opposed to a so-called government
"National salvation", adding precisely those who have buried and want to continue
bury the country.
A government whose viability is in the hands of the Portuguese people, constituted on the basis of
forces and political sectors, Democrats and independent personalities, who identify
with the patriotic and left policy, supported by organizations and mass movements
the anti-monopoly social sectors.
A government that constitutes a necessary and urgent political solution, which has to be entered
as a key objective for the future of the country, and whose implementation is only possible with
the significant strengthening of the influence of PCP and its allies in the CDU in elections of 5
June.
