INTRODUCTION

CiU's priority Catalunya. Right now we have the challenge of
deal with the crisis and job losses by initiating a
new stage. Catalunya has a future, but needs more capacity for action
and self-government to influence the recovery in job creation and
the consolidation of the welfare state.
The last term has represented the turning point in the lace
Catalonia in the state. The Constitutional Court ruling against
Statute of Autonomy, the actions of the government, the opposition and the
courts in relation to the Catalan educational model and especially the hasty and
exclusive constitutional reform this summer, reaffirm the need for
begin a new stage in Catalan politics in Madrid.
In Catalunya this new stage and started last year with victory
CiU electoral, and the arrival of Artur Mas as President of the Generalitat.
Our country is again governed by a force unequivocally
nationalist. Now the political Catalan, which has always been engine
Instead, progress and modernity, is facing the great challenge of fighting
the deep economic crisis affecting our society. How is it going
condition also puts in relief the discredit of politics and
institutions, it is also necessary to take decisive action to recover
the confidence of citizens. And also the Catalan has to
engage fully in building the future of the Catalans, assuming the
challenges of the new millennium and proposing solutions.
CiU has played the last 33 years a very prominent role in the
State institutions. Our involvement in the formulation and approval of
the Constitution and consolidating the young democracy was a first
example. Since that first stage until now we have made a
more generous support which has been both during relay
absolute majorities of either Spanish party, like, especially when
We guarantee governance by stability agreements. Is
involvement in Spanish politics has given us an undoubted prestige, that,
However, too often it has been neither valued nor reciprocated
when we made the only legitimate demands for self-government
for Catalunya.
CiU political action in state institutions aims
Catalunya priority, especially in the demand for a fiscal pact
ensure the necessary resources to revive the Catalan economy, create
employment and maintaining social cohesion in times of extreme hardship.
Our sectoral commitments the formulated grouped into four
major objectives to:

?

?

-

Reactivate the productive economy and create jobs
Formulate welfare policies to strengthen social cohesion and equality
opportunities.
Respond to future challenges.
Ask democratic quality measures.

The CiU will have an active role in the world it is evident
through proposals to design policy in the Catalan presence
international institutions, with a special emphasis on European policy,
the Mediterranean environment and international cooperation.
All the program responds to higher capacity approaches
self-government and national emancipation, but obviously devote a
special attention to those issues that will preside over the action of CiU in
Madrid in this new phase now begins the fiscal pact, the defense
Catalan language and the educational model and capacity development
self-government of Catalonia.
In difficult times we must strengthen the convictions, act more
boldness and respond effectively to the challenges of Catalan society. In
complex times, Catalunya can not give up their legitimate aspirations.
It is in this spirit that the Catalan CiU policy held in Madrid
begins a new stage.

2. REVIVE THE PRODUCTIVE ECONOMY AND JOBS

Open a new economic future for Catalunya
It is time to open a new economic future for Catalonia. To do this, the
political initiative can not be continuity but change. It's necessary
renew the social contract that we maintain society and governments.

Five great changes that we demand from Catalunya:
a) The Fiscal Pact
You need to change the financial relations between Catalonia and Spain
through the Fiscal Pact to provide better funding for Catalonia. Ago
lack a more important part of the taxes paid by Catalans
continue in Catalunya as a matter of justice and improving the rule of
being (see section on Fiscal Pact).
b) Austerity and efficiency in central government
We have to change the dynamics of spending and indebtedness
central administration. Will generate deficit against future generations, the
goal should be to minimize the deficit. In four years, between 2008 and 2011, the
payment of interest on the state debt has grown by 65%, from
16,600 million euros to 27,400 million euros. For the 2012 payment
Interest will exceed 33,000 million euros, exceeding everyone who
paid in unemployment benefits or all of the non-financial budget
Generalitat. It is necessary to root out this evil criticizes evolution
future generations of our welfare bill. The Central Administration
It must be smaller and more efficient, more austere. We must rationalize,
removing lead agencies and the entire administration Generalitat
peripheral.
Amend the Constitution to balance public accounts in 2020, not us
It serves the short term. Paying more than 30,000 million per year in
desestructura interests all economic and social policies
Been. So you have to move quickly to minimize the deficit,
with only two caveats: do not spoil the welfare state and leave room
to stimulate economic growth.
-

Over the next four years it will be necessary to thin the administration
PBX via: merger and abolition of agencies, transfer to
CCAA your peripheral administration and through the application of
policies of austerity and efficiency.

-

It is necessary to reduce the number of ministries in the administration
Central. We propose the integration of the Ministry of Science and Innovation
at the Ministry of Industry and the suppression of the ministries of Culture,
Health and Social Affairs, which in all three cases managed

?

?

skills corresponding to the CCAA. In the case of healthcare,
regulatory skills can be developed from a secretariat
General under the Ministry of Economy.
-

Deficit reduction must also come for a thorough review of
the purposes that meets the state owned companies. will be
necessary to privatize those shares, entities or companies
public not considered strategic for the public sector.

c) More growth: Liquidity and job creation
We have to change the economic policy stimuli to strengthen
growth and job creation. To trim the deficit is not enough
austerity in public spending are needed more income. The key is to
help the productive economy to grow, provide liquidity and create jobs,
this is the path that will bring more resources to public finances to
reduce the deficit and debt. SME financing, incentives for
reinvestment and innovation, internationalization support, a plan of
shock to job creation and labor reform to strengthen the
flexicurity, as the European Union is proposing. These are the axes
boost growth.
-

For CIU, will be economic growth which returns us
labor, economic, social and budgetary normality our
society. Therefore we must encourage all potential and
capacity of civil society, together with the public sector and
create an environment conducive to productivity and competitiveness
promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and long-
duration.

-

More growth through fiscal policy: The review of taxation
You must commit itself to fiscal restraint and reduce taxes
investment, reinvestment and job creation.

-

More growth through financial policy: The crisis has collapsed
the regular functioning of the financial system:

?

•

It is necessary to restructure the operation of ICO
closer and responding to SMEs, both working as
by investment.

•

It is necessary to restructure the functioning of organisms
public financing for more efficient service
growth and competitiveness.

•

It is necessary to use public resources to FROB
that the recipient funds instrumentalize public funding
to SMEs.

•

It is necessary to implement alternative ways of financing
financial institutions, such as proximity or investors
?

business angels, mediators of credit, venture capital,
alternative stock markets, preferential loans or
instruments endorsement of the Mutual Guarantee
for SMEs.
-

More growth through labor policy: bonuses of up to
100% in social security contributions on the recruitment of new
occupations and giving a subsidy of 5,000? for each new
stable contract.

-

More growth through administrative policy: It is important
to create a company in 24 hours, but still is more secure
a permanent administrative simplification in the operation of the
Companies with the Inland Revenue, with simplified accounting for the
SMEs, or the presentation of the accounts to the register. Demand that
legislating for SMEs and for every new regulation repeal another
As minimum.

-

More growth through support to entrepreneurs: Support
financial, specific for this purpose and tax and labor support lines.
Until the new entrepreneur does not invoice over 30,000?, With
maximum of two years, shall be exempt from taxation on income tax and Societies,
while you enjoy a 100% bonus on contributions
social and autonomous. This will also be an important way of
outcrop economy.

-

More growth through innovation and internationalization.
Both are engines of economic recovery and change
Catalunya experienced production model.

d) Innovation and industrial policy
We have to change the sectoral vision of promoting activity
productive. The engine of the new economic future is in Catalunya
innovation, both in traditional sectors such as new sectors.
And innovation will take the form of new products and services or new
processes and is in the hands of the training, experience or
investigation and development. Only innovation we can enter new
markets, we internationalize, and we will keep markets
Catalan traditional. Innovation is the basis of industrial policy
XXI century.
e) More public-private
We have to change the relationship between the public sector and the private sector,
both they have to work more closely in the activities of interest
general. Public institutions and the administration must be guarantors
the general interest, but the provision of services is sometimes more efficient
managed by the private sector and civil society. It's time to update the
social contract between citizens and administration. We need to preserve and
enhance the welfare state in the most efficient manner and this requires
?

???

more involvement of civil society and the third sector, more collaboration
Public-private.

2.1.1. Review of fiscal policy to win in equity and stimulate
growth
The crisis has misplaced the state tax system, revenue collected

economic, now taxed little, pass taxed according to their
possibilities; also means that the taxation of families with children and

We reclaim the transfer of land and promote the revision of

Combating tax fraud
Against tax fraud and large against the small. It can not be that now that
He has dropped fraud resulting from the real estate sale, by falling
transactions, dramatically increase the underground economy on the other.
We must fight the large and the small fraud, also on the
perception of social benefits.
-

It's important to fight undeclared income and hidden
to thoroughly review the correct formal declaration of
yields actually declared. If you really want to fight
tax fraud must be put in the Tax Inspection
way of discovering the facts undeclared limit fraud and putting
the underground economy of dangerous proportions.

-

We have to reduce conflict between the tax authorities and
taxpayers. A tax system based on self-assessments generated
many conflicts that just before the administrative courts
first and contentious administrative later. Get a resolution
It represents two or three years of waiting. A heavy workload for
courts and disproportionate costs for the taxpayer, if
It considers that much of the lawsuits end up giving reason at all
or in part, to claimants.

-

To reduce this conflict is proposed that the económicoadministrativa via voluntary, can contact the taxpayer
directly to the competent court (contentious-administrative).
In addition, taxpayers must be entitled to reimbursement
Management of all expenses incurred in the
claims and lawsuits, including those of lawyers and solicitors when
they are estimated or all of their requests.

Tax and to concentrate the bulk of human resources fighting
fraud to the discovery of undeclared income.

European tax harmonization
-

CIU is manifested in favor of a process of fiscal harmonization and
European Economic and as a way to consolidate against the euro area
it currently suffers imbalances. However, this process is
conditioned and must be accompanied by the implementation of the

?

???

Eurobonds in the context of the European financial system. Consolidation
fiscal and financing through Eurobonds are two legs of the same
building of the European economy that will help us overcome the crisis.
2.1.2. Financial policy
The crisis has highlighted the structural deficiencies and weaknesses
Finance system. From a European and international perspective are detected
critical imbalances that result in higher financing costs and
uncertainties for several economies such as Spanish. From the perspective

Financial: it has cleared the fabric of savings and the whole system

It has been particularly difficult in Catalonia. To restore lending to the
CIU productive activity poses:
-

In Europe, CIU will reiterate its commitment to the euro and the
financial stability of the monetary union, while we will demand
more quickly to the Community institutions to fill gaps
regulation and supervision of financial markets.

-

Also in Europe, we will require issuance of new Eurobonds with
support of all eurozone economies.

-

CiU ensure the transparency of the financial system and the rigor of
the performance of regulatory bodies to ensure the solvency of
financial institutions and the efficient functioning of the system itself.
Avoid that can never be repeated confusion, lack of
transparency and slow response of the regulatory body which has
produced in the last term and has led to a serious
weakening of the financial system.

-

In the domestic market, we will require maximum transparency in the
balances of credit institutions and promote their capitalization.

-

We will ensure to preserve in Catalunya centers of decision
financial institutions that provide continuity to the Catalan savings banks, post
they are a relevant instruments to finance productive activity

-

The granting of state aid to financial institutions will

-

The duration of the period of restructuring of financial institutions,
Needless to tracks from government are implemented
financing alternatives.

?

???

-

The ICO should be restructured to have a structure that
enable effective response to the fabric of small and medium enterprises.

-

The diversity of the State funding agencies also have to
be restructured to meet the needs of companies and
the growth of the economy.

-

The dispersed ICO loan deal must be rationalized, must
strengthen working capital lines and maintain a continuous assessment,
transparent, on the effectiveness of use of each of the lines
the credit available to it.

-

Financial institutions participated by the FROB instrumentalizarán
public credit guarantee to SMEs, by establishing
agreements with the ICO and other public credit institutions, which
will revert to more efficiently by the ICO and financing for SMEs.

-

We will implement a system of tax credit conversion debts
tax that the tax administration has the company,
eg VAT, being able to deduct or endorse third.

-

Urgent we will open new alternative ways of financing
to SMEs and independent with growth projects. Will regulate
tax incentives similar to those given to venture capital
risk for investors or business angels proximity.

-

In the field of venture capital, we will remove the current cap of 58% of the
endowments that companies can invest in venture capital
equity loans to SMEs.

-

Tax will stimulate the SME financing through
secondary markets such as the Alternative Investment Market.

-

The reinvestment of profits is another way of self-financing, so
We propose an increase in tax deductions for reinvestment
from the current 12% to 18%.

-

We will promote tax incentives to facilitate the capitalization
companies by their shareholders, either through
contributions or reinvestment.

-

We will strengthen the mutual guarantee companies (SGR) to facilitate
Acknowledgement to SMEs with viable projects, but
sufficient guarantees for lending by the
financial institutions and also to support the issue of obligations
companies do in the capital market.

DEMOCRATIC QUALITY

5.1.

Democratic regeneration

We revalidamos our commitment to the welfare state, Democratic
law and pluralist, with each and every one of its elements such as the
economic system of social market economy; the welfare state
as guarantor of social cohesion model; and pluralist democracy,
parliamentary and representative as a political model.
There is no doubt that the economic crisis and its social effects are putting
test the political system. But this in no way justifies or permits
claim to replace parliamentary democracy, contrasted along
over a hundred years, a so-called "real democracy".
Certainly parliamentary democracy is capable of deepening and
gets better. Through the deepening and improvement of its constituent elements:
the division of powers, the rule of law as an expression of the will
popular, recognition and respect of rights and duties
fundamental. Through reform of the electoral system and its
accompanied where appropriate with instruments of democracy
directly.
We want to deepen and improve our democracy and make more effective
principle of popular sovereignty. What we are not willing to replace it
by systems that have left the story, before disappearing a trail
tyranny, violations of fundamental rights and economic ruin.
We want a comprehensive rethinking of the way we do politics,
Fashion govern the way of opposition. We bet on
dialogue, tolerance and respect between adversaries and to bring politics
the citizenship. So we want to express and propose:
-

We want the State and its institutions recognize the right
to decide for ourselves what we want for Catalonia.

-

They must give clear and accurate messages to the public. The lie
and deceit can never override the truth and
defending the common good.

Any pact with CiU has to be
based on the progress of Catalonia and its citizens, which is
our priority and our reason for being. CiU shun any
agreement which does not meet this priority.

A NEW STAGE
Catalan politics IN MADRID

A NEW STAGE OF POLITICAL CATALAN IN MADRID

On November 20, Convergence and Union for a new stage begins
Catalan politics in Madrid. The set of events and
attitudes that have occurred within the recent Spanish politics
years and the events while our own country put us in
inflection point.
In this sense, the upcoming Spanish elections represent not only the
beginning of a new legislature within a framework of continuity. We are facing a
and some point after 33 years of political action in the courts. And open
the opportunity to consolidate the change started almost 12 months ago
Catalunya.
The November 28, 2010, our country opted for a change of course.
A large majority of the people chose a Catalan nationalist government
lead by Artur Mas. A change that meant the beginning of a new stage
politics: a commitment to the right to decide. With no other tool
that democracy and no other limit than the mark at all times
the people of Catalonia; a nation that has never renounced its
inherent rights as a people.
To guarantee the right to decide to remain a nation
cohesive, to guarantee coexistence and economic progress,
social and cultural life of the whole of the Catalan people. And with a first milestone very
Important: the fiscal pact.
The beginning of new stage of Catalan politics in Madrid do not have to
understood in any case as a flight forward, but is the result of a
mature analysis that shares a large majority of the people of Catalonia and
It combines two premises.
First. Catalunya can not not want to sacrifice your self, your
identity and nation building, for more stones to put him
the road. Second. After everything that has happened, relationships
between Catalonia and the Spanish State will undoubtedly have to change.
The Constitutional Court ruling against the statute was a fact very
grave, acquiring a historical dimension. A court with a majority of its
members with the mandate expired, and therefore-and delegitimized
absolute harmony with the two Spaniards parties obviated the majority will
the Catalan town of greater self-government expressed in a referendum. The
Constitutional Court showed that there was no will
?

????

to deepen the constitutional pact and evolve the State
Spanish towards a multinational state. Spain wants to remain a
a single nation state.
Against this wall of misunderstanding, Catalonia has two options. Accept and
therefore diluted into an administrative region,
homogenized, almost folkloric or not falter and continue to defend its
self-government and freedom as a nation. And as I made clear the village
Catalunya on July 10, 2010, can not give up: we are a nation,
we decided.
This summer, it has again demonstrated the clear desire to have
the PSOE and the PP by laminar our self-government. The two parties
Spaniards agreed to and approved in haste to reform the
Constitution that blatantly excludes the first game of Catalunya,
party of the Government of Catalonia, one of the actors of the covenant
Constitution of 1978. The objective of austerity and stability
budget in line with Europe is shared by CiU. But
content which undermines the financial autonomy of the Generalitat, attitude and
forms on an issue as sensitive as constitutional reform is a
all-out attack, and therefore, involves a turning point in the
constitutional consensus.
The reform of the Constitution is not, unfortunately, a single event, but the
confirmation of a clear trend. The two Spanish majority parties
fully share the same vision and determination to end
granting greater self-government and freedom for Catalonia and carry
out a strong and constant recentralization of powers to the state.
It shows, finally, a willingness to backtrack respect
these past 30 years. An attitude increasingly evident and which had
first sign the judgment of the Statute positively valued by the PP
and the PSOE.
If there is a central element of our collective identity this is the
language. It is a symbol, is heritage, it's past, present and future, integration
and is cohesion. In this respect, it is regrettable attempts both newspapers
Internal by groups of tiny representation, and external, to
question and attack the role of Catalan, the language of
Catalunya. The attempt to load the hit-and endorsed
internationally-language immersion model is an example. A
attitude certainly is not new in recent months. The third time
Castilian imposed by the Spanish socialist Government in 2007 was an attack
fledged linguistic model of Catalan schools.

?

????

Moreover, the current economic crisis is revealing of
more dramatically than ever that the structural fiscal deficit suffered
Catalunya is unsustainable. It represents a drain that we can not
allow it represents a loss of quality of life for the Catalans
as resources to be and never come back. A current model
that under the skin of solidarity with the poorest territories hides
actually a huge fiscal plundering.
At present, it is no longer about getting a little better, to one, two
or three steps forward respect to the funding we have. Now
it comes to getting our part, the result of our effort.
It is able to collect and manage all the resources we generate. In
Here, it must be remembered that a funding model
singled out, proper and in accordance with our fiscal capacity adjustments
It is making the Catalan government would be extremely minor,
almost imperceptible.
Before a decision that frustrated the legitimate aspirations of the Catalan people.
Faced with a constitutional reform that breaks the spirit of the pact made
possible. Given the continuing attempts of re and the refusal to
meet demands for greater self-government. Given the constant attack
one of the most central, most loved and most valuable elements of our
identity. Faced with a fiscal deficit that strangles us. In short, before a
feeling of incomprehension towards claims, feelings and
will be of the Catalans, for CiU no place for resignation or
conformism. Given all these elements, which generate strong
growing emotional distance with the state about everything there is a
clear will of the vast majority of the people of Catalunya
remain what we are proudly and project into the future.
CiU's commitment is to convey in the Spanish Parliament this will.
The commitment to the right to decide to achieve self-government quotas
the people of Catalonia demands and needs, and specifically, the bet
for the fiscal pact is not only a challenge of CiU. It is a challenge for the country. It is the
legitimate aspiration of the people of Catalonia. Correspondingly, 20
November also starts a new stage of Catalan politics in Madrid
to make this possible. It is a new stage of Catalan politics in Madrid.
New stage of new and distinct challenges: and above all, you, the covenant
prosecutor. Greater national ambition: we want more self-government, more
sovereignty and freedom for our country. New forms: more
firmly than ever. And with a new relationship with Madrid: bilateral, face to face,
between Catalonia and the Spanish State. A new stage Convergence only
Union is able to lead.

?

????

1. Fiscal Pact
Catalunya has been the motor of all regional financing arrangements.
And it has always committed to fiscal responsibility and the
inter-regional solidarity. But unfortunately, the agreements reached have not been
advanced the line of responsibility - the case of the latter
2009 deal, where for example the basket that the State taxes
It assigned to the Generalitat has been undermined by a mechanism
redistribution of resources between regions, and where there has been
complied with the duty of creating a tax consortium. Nor it has
progress in the field of inter-regional solidarity in line with the
compounds or states: it is clear to see that the fiscal deficit
suffering Catalunya is a clear demonstration.
It is for this reason that CiU promote a fiscal pact, understood as a
unique financing model for system-outside Catalunya
common system and the multilateral negotiation of similar characteristics to
concert or convention regime.
It is starting a process that, on the one hand allow a majority of
the resources generated and produced in our stay in Catalunya
country and other, which enables the Catalan institutions that are the
responsible for managing all of the taxes generated or
paid in Catalunya.
A funding model based on the fiscal pact means higher
chances of being, prosperity, economic progress and
social, more opportunities to modernize our society and
and more political power to Catalunya.
Claiming a self-financing model for Catalonia drags
a great social consensus that need to be moved on a broad consensus
political, both in Catalonia and in the state political arena by
Catalan parties beyond ideological affinities or political ties.
The feasibility of a self-funding model is in terms Catalunya
clearly constitutional and statutory law. The Constitution, in terms of
funding commitment and an open model simply states only
some principles: financial autonomy of the Autonomous Communities
meet and exercise its powers in accordance with the principles of
coordination with the State Treasury and solidarity among all
citizens of the state.

?

????

Furthermore, the Act which develops the model, LOFCA, has been fairly
flexible to support different models, such as Basque, Navarre or
canary.
The Statute of Catalonia is also flexible enough to allow
Catalan Fiscal Pact to ensure the full development and implementation of
Fiscal Pact, we must strengthen the bilateral established in the same statute.
In this regard, consider CiU Basic introducing a clause
except for Catalonia in LOFCA that gives own uniqueness, just
as already he proposed in its 2008 election manifesto.
This model of financing own unique Catalunya will have to
based on the following characteristics:
to)
A bilateral relationship between the Catalan and state,
through the Joint Commission on Economic and Fiscal Affairs State -
Government under the statute.
b)
The adoption of a Law on Transfer of Taxes for Catalunya
includes the transfer of 100% of the income of all taxes that are
generate or paid in Catalunya.
c)
The full regulatory powers over the taxes generated
Catalonia in the context of the powers of the State and the European Union.
d)
The full tax management (levy, collection, settlement and
inspection) of all taxes generated in Catalonia, through the
Tax Agency of Catalunya.
e)
The establishment of an annual quota of Catalan contribution
concept on the one hand, participation of Catalonia in the proportion
loads the relevant State to the provision of services or
exercise of powers not assumed by the Government and, on the other hand, the
amount corresponding to comply with principles of solidarity

f)
The Fiscal Pact has to have mechanisms Revision

revenue, making it compulsory for updating every five years.

3. Basic elements of the language model school in Catalunya
The linguistic model of education in Catalonia coincides large
features, in that once the Law 7/1983, of April 18, was fixed
linguistic normalization of Catalonia, passed by a very wide majority
?

????

133 parliamentary votes of the 135 possible votes, and that was
analyzed in detail by the Constitutional Court in the Judgment
337/1994 of 23 December.
It was a clear commitment to one educational model, which had to do
possible that the whole population of Catalunya had a chance to
knowledge of both official languages ​​and, in the case of Catalan, this premise
it was really only possible if Catalan was the first language in the
school, since the situation of the Catalan language, at all levels, was
clearly and indisputably inferior, precarious using the term that appears to
preamble of Law 7/1983 of 18 April on language standardization in
Catalunya.
In this judgment, the Constitutional Court declared their conformity with the
Spanish Constitution. That ruling recognized the full constitutionality
model has been applied, pursuant to which, in response to the objective of
linguistic normalization of Catalan, correcting and reach over
imbalances between the two official languages, and to serve the
integration and social cohesion in this region, not students
are separated into centers or different kind groups because of their
habitual vehicular language and language of education for all is the
Catalonia itself, so that Catalan can be the "center
gravity "model, although this entails the exclusion of Castilian, for
they can reach sufficient knowledge of both languages ​​at the end of
compulsory education and where the right to education does not lead to
performance based educational administration activity may be
conditioned by the free choice of the stakeholders of the teaching language.
The constitutionality of that model declared by the Constitutional Court
in its judgment 337/1994 and its successful offering
application, determined that the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia itself of
2006 pick its defining elements.
Well, after almost thirty years of application of this same line
language policy initiated in the 80s, it is clear that in many areas, has
improved the presence of the language and, thanks to this policy, all
new generations of citizens of Catalonia, when just the
compulsory education, are able to express themselves, both orally
and in writing, in both official languages, as evidenced by all
objective studies made both Catalunya and from the State, such
So it can be said that the education system meets the legal mandate
established by Article 10 of the Education Act, under which
curricula must ensure full control of the official languages
Catalan and Castilian upon completing compulsory education, according to
Common European Framework of Reference for learning, teaching and
evaluation of languages.
However, it is noted, but this knowledge of the two languages
officers, at the same level, it has only been possible by the fact that Catalan

?

????

It is the language normally used in the education system, which has been a
compensating element in language use in our society.
This growing trend of foreign students, which also has
very different linguistic origins, decreases obviously the
percentage of students who joins the educational system whose
Catalan tongue.
Therefore, the only school framework that happens, reality view
sociolinguistics of the country, ensures the right of all citizens
to know both official languages, which guarantees equal
opportunities for everyone. Therefore, despite these data, our
students when they finish compulsory education, have a very knowledge
like the Catalan and Spanish.
For all that has been exposed, and particularly the important deficit
everyday knowledge and use of Catalan among students
that compulsory schooling starts, we understand that in order to ensure
the legal requirement of full ownership of the two official languages, Catalan
Castilian upon completing compulsory education, continue with the
current Catalan education model, according to current legislation
which considers the Catalan language as the language normally used
vehicular and learning in the education system and that does not exclude the
Spanish, as prescribed by the judgment of the Supreme Court
December 16, 2010.
Thus, using the same expression and the constant reference Judgment,
the state of linguistic normalization of Catalan society, not allow
changing the current educational model, if you want to ensure the same
results today.

4. Claiming the powers to be exercised by the Government.
Five years after its adoption, the Statute of Catalonia not being
deploying from state institutions to the level of loyalty
necessary to comply with its provisions. In addition, the judgment of the
Constitutional Court has breached the statutory pact endorsed by the people of
Catalunya, showing that there is a willingness to regressive
display levels of self-government that the statute gives us.
