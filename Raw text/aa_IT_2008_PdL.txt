This program extends over the whole
the next legislature and will be fully realized
by its end.
Five years is a period of time sufficient
long to graduate the progressive advance of
interventions that we are committed to achieve.
In any case there is well clear that the realization
our program has undergone three external constraints
Essential:

a) the constraint imposed by the current economic crisis in the world and in Italy.
This crisis may worsen and that over the past two years has been
irresponsibly ignored or underestimated by the Prodi government;

b) the constraint imposed by the European treaty commitments, commitments that Italy
It took over and that our next government intends to respect.
As it has already been done in the period of our government characterized
from an economic downturn that has led Germany
and France - but not Italy - on the threshold of the "sanctions" of Europe;
c) the constraint imposed by the current unstable balance of public accounts
Italian.

In these terms, the implementation activities of this program
We will however gradually and responsibly made
light of economic developments and in accordance with criteria of rigor
in the management of the public budget.
We do not promise miracles.

In any case we never put your hands in the pockets of citizens.

The reform of Title V of the Constitution place
the conditions to start a broad process
transfer of powers from the center to the periphery.

For recognition of genuine autonomy of Regions
and local authorities need to be conducted on fiscal federalism,
which involves the transfer of financial resources from the center

overall.

A special plan
Not therefore we will increase the tax burden.
Indeed we will strive to reduce it.
Stationary the goal of contrast and recovery
tax evasion.

Our focus now is on the opposite side of public spending,
rather we reduce overspending, not warranty
social, and therefore compressible.
Since the cost of politics and bureaucracy
(Eg provinces unnecessary).
In parallel to these actions of ordinary character, we think
However it is possible and necessary to the restructuring plan
extraordinary of our public finances.
A plan articulated as follows.
Within the structure of our public finances, as it has gradually
formed over the past thirty years, we see emerging 5 points
essential characteristic:
a) the asset exceeds its liabilities.
Public property (about 1,800 billion Euros)
species is greater than public debt (about 1.500 billion euro);
b) all liabilities as public debt is placed on the market,
while the part of active ingredient that may be set and enhanced
on the market, made by shares, companies, real estate, receivables,
concession rights, etc. (Up to 40% of the total,
up to about 700 billion Euros) it is still in public;

Program 15x21

14-03-2008

Page 21

c) symmetrically, the bulk of private savings is directly
and indirectly invested in liabilities (and especially in debt securities
public) and not in place;
d) while almost all public debt of the central government (the State),
the bulk of the public trust that can be placed and valued
on the market - about two-thirds of the total - is of local governments (regions,
Provinces, municipalities). Finally, while the central government (the State) tents
to privatize, many local governments follow the opposite process tends
to advertise;
e) while almost all the tax levy is the central (state),
the growing part of the discretionary public spending is local
(Regions, Provinces, Municipalities).
Our proposal is a great and free agreement between the state, regions,
Provinces, municipalities, savers and investors.
A condition that:
achieve fiscal federalism solidarity, of which all'art.119 of the Constitution;
reduce the debt of the state, entering the market share
corresponding to public property, offering savers
and economic operators more and better investment opportunities.
The final effects are expected: the reduction of the public debt;
a lower cost of debt remaining; greater transparency,
greater accountability and efficiency of public spending;
the reorganization and the digitization of public administration,
economic recovery.
Only on this basis, not by raising taxes on income, house,
Savings, on VAT numbers, but breaking down the dead hand of the debt
public, Italy can start.

the special plan and the results of our action against tax evasion
Tax Investigation with the reform of the tax collection through the effective
participation of Commons investigation, strengthening
financial administration, the project of reform from the bottom
