STATE AND CITIZENS

Page 3 of 15

The current organization of the state is bureaucratic, over-sized, expensive, inefficient.
The Parliament does not represent the citizens who can not choose
the candidate, but the party's symbol. The Constitution is not applied. The parties have
replaced the will of the people and stolen his control and judgment.

If it were strictly enforced the law 10/91, to heat buildings
they consume 14 liters of diesel, or cubic meters of natural gas per square meter
walkable year. In fact if they consume more. Since 2002 German law, and more than
Recent legislation in force in the Province of Bolzano, set to 7 liters of diesel, or meters
cubes of natural gas per square meter per year walkable consumption maximum allowed
heating environments. Less than half the average Italian consumer. Using
labeling in force in home appliances, in the Province of Bolzano this level
It corresponds to the class C, while the class B corresponds to a consumption of not more than 5
liters of gas oil, or cubic meters of methane, and to the class A a consumption of not more than 3 liters of
gas oil, or cubic meters of methane, per square meter per year. In the space heating,
an energy policy aimed at reducing CO2 emissions, also to avoid
economic sanctions envisaged by the Kyoto treaty against defaulting countries, should
articulated in the following points:
• Immediate implementation of the legislation, which was established by Law 10/91 and required by
European Directive 76/93 on the energy certification of buildings
• Defining the class C of the province of Bolzano as the maximum level of consumption for the
granting of building permits relating to both new buildings and restructuring of
existing buildings
• Reduction of at least 10 percent over five years in energy consumption of assets
construction of public bodies, with financial penalties for defaulting
• Benefits on bank advances and regulatory relief for contracts
energy refurbishments by the method I go out (energy service company), or carried in
expense of the realized and repaid by the savings made from it

• Development of legislation on payment to consumption of thermal energy in apartment blocks,
as required by EU Directive 76/93, already applied by other European countries.
The average efficiency of thermal power plants Enel is around 38%. The
standard used to construct the new generation plants, combined cycle, is the
55/60%.
The co-generation of electricity and widespread heat, using heat in the place of
production and transport of electricity at a distance, allowing you to use the potential
the energy of the fuel up to 97%. Inefficiencies and waste in the current production
thermoelectric are not acceptable neither technologically nor economically nor morally,
both for the devastating effects on the environment, and because they accelerate the depletion of resources
fossils, and because they involve a hoarding on the part of rich countries to the detriment of
Poor countries. It is not acceptable by itself remove the need for those who need it, but if then
wastes, is inconceivable. To increase the supply of electricity is not necessary to build
new power plants of any kind. The first thing to do is to increase efficiency and reduce
wastage of existing plants, while increasing the efficiency with which the energy produced
It is used by utilities (lights, appliances, air conditioners and industrial machinery).
Only later, when the energy supply is still lacking, you may decide to build new
electricity generation plants. In the production of electrical and thermal energy, a policy
Energy aimed at reducing CO2 emissions by increasing the offer, should
articulated in the following points:
• Upgrading and reducing the environmental impact of existing thermal power plants
• Promotion of distributed generation of electricity with technologies that use sources
fossil in more efficient ways, such as co-diffused generation of electricity and heat, low
from buildings more energy-intensive: hospitals, com-mercial, industrial processes that use heat
technological, sports centers etc.

Information is one of the foundations of democracy and individual survival. If the
Control of information is concentrated in a few actors, inevitably occur drifts
undemocratic. If the information has references as economic entities and not the citizen, the
corporate interests and economic power groups prevail over the interests of the
single. The information then is the basis of any other area of ​​social interest. The Citizen
uninformed or misinformed can not decide, can not choose. It serves as a
consumer and voter passive, excluded from decisions affecting it.

Italy is one of the few countries with a public health system with universal access. Two facts
But are undermining the foundations of the universality and homogeneity of the National Health Service: the
Devolution, which entrusts to the regions the health care and its financing and accentuates
regional differences, and the private health sector that diverts resources and talents to the public. It also tends to
organize the WHO as a company and give precedence to the economic objectives than those of
health and quality of services.
IS FREE OF CARE AND EQUITABLE ACCESS

free
• Ticket proportional to income for non-essential services
• Monitor and correct the effects of devolution on equity of access to health
DRUGS

drugs "brand" (which often cost more in Italy and abroad) and safer than
newly approved products

takes place for example in the UK)
