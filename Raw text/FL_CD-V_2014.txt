This is the socio-economic plan of the CD & V. It expresses what is essential for us: the economic and social issues, two communicating vessels. The
specificity of our ideas has to do with how we communicate. With us at the helm: prosperity, yes, in full, but not without being,
not without social solidarity. The socio-economic plan is a 3D plan:
the characteristics that are paramount and underpin the entire plan are clear,
sustainability and targeting. We have in recent months, with
Minister-President Kris Peeters in front, much listened: to managers, employees, school children, dependents, caregivers, artists, chefs, fathers and mothers, people looking for work ... We were
On tour. We know what our plan is received.

Now we need to skillfully perform the constitutional reform and that means taking major decisions and reforms. Since experience has been and
vision is needed, there is a party with a plan for necessary so that people know
Flanders in which they wake up tomorrow.
Globally, the good life in Flanders. But the crisis is not going away, our industry needs a transformation, employment remains an important
concern. This is not the time for adventures, for the bickering
confidence in our economy can cripple. We have over the past years of crisis measures and the results are visible: the
consumer confidence returns, business confidence rising
and the financial markets have recovered confidence in our country. What we have
seeded, begins to germinate. We must take care of the fragile plant so good
it can grow. It is not the time to put it in stormy weather. This
So the momentum for confidence. That trust is there and we must
retained. CD & V is ideally ensures that trust. Why and how,
refer to this plan.
11 ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH SOCIAL PROGRESS
for, inter alia, people with
disability, child care, elderly,
families and young people may counter
2019 increase by 750 million.
With this we make a difference. That
is a warm and solidary Flanders.
You read also, already, in which Flanders you, with CD & V will live. We
say those who work anymore, should net about love. We increase
the share of income that you
not pay tax on. That gives you about 700 euros a year more
on. With these encouraging reform
we're working on and we appreciate
the more the difference between working and not working increases. Who
works often makes extra charges
childcare, mobility ... The
more revenue from work becomes so
affected, so that the balance is currently sometimes pass in the wrong direction. CD & V wants to work
pays, it pays to take that
Day pays bijsteken.
The cost of that tax cuts are paid for through savings in the federal budget, in
social security and in the Flemish budget. With one basic
side note: we do not choose
a global nominal zero growth, which
means that we do not loans
freeze at the level of 2014.
That would mean that the growth
the number of retirees would automatically lead to a drop
of the pension amount. Or that
increase in the number of trainees and
the dependents should not be transformed into more teachers and
in more carers.
We invest 6 billion in wage tax cuts, of which 3 billion
to get more people into work
and get three billion people
reward that work. We shift the burden from labor to indirect taxes and green tax systems,
simplify tax deductions
and intensify the fight against fraud. We are not alone with this view: the IMF, the OECD, the European
Commission and the High Council
Finance advocating these shifts.
When the savings on the federal budget, we'll go for a
budget freeze but we spared
civil servants' pensions and
social assistance. In the Social Security we assume a real
growth of 0.9%. This means yet
still 4.5 billion more on top
inflation. Less growth than in the
past, but sufficient to produce a
quality protection too
to keep possible in the future
provided that we implement a number of structural reforms. We also inhibit early retirement from

Flanders continues with CD & V the hot Flanders that is our trademark. The investment plan
the economy and innovation, education,
mobility, the environment and care is
2.7 billion on top of constant
policy. That means that we have a
creating growth path that by 2019 recurring amounts to 866 million euros.
In addition, we provide, in addition to the
Flemish long-term budget, too
an envelope New Social Policy
of 2.3 billion euros. The expenses

PREFACE
Within the Flemish budget, we start from the increase
the cost drivers of the constant
policy as they are included in
Flemish multiannual budget.
In 2019, means that in conjunction with the
index up 3 billion euro
compared to 2014 for the existing powers. The biggest
we see constant increases in policy
in education (1.3 billion), Administrative Affairs (0.48 billion) and welfare (0.45
billion). In Teaching rise
credits in the first place by
the expected increase in the number
students, which translates directly
in the increase in the number of teachers. Expenditure on wages
In compulsory and part-time
art thus know
an increase of 374 million euros,
exclusive index, over the next
five years. The operation also benefits
for universities and colleges
take increased substantially. Together with the
additional appropriations for integration
colleges and universities
the multi-annual budget comes to 175
extra million by 2019. In
Welfare take loans up by
an annual increase of 2.5% in
the hours quota family care. The
Care Fund follows the same increase
of 2.5% to the increase in the number of
files mantle and to cope home care and residential care.
Administrative Affairs at the increase in
the constant policy almost entirely
due to the annual decree
increases of 3.5% of the Municipalities, the Urban and
the Provinces. For the new
powers the increase
in constant policy 1.6 billion.
It also contains natural cost drivers such as the number of children
between 0-18 years old and people aged 80 years. These parameters
determine the level of appropriations
For the child, or the elderly. On the global
Flemish budget we put a
savings plan on cruising
amounts to two billion. That is one effort that is similar to the
we saving this term
have done during the first two
years. Since the Flemish budget mass through the 6th state reform
rising from 28 billion euro to 38
billion should this effort
are again feasible.
Business is about taking risks and
takes courage. Entrepreneurship
thrives best in an environment of
appreciation. This requires an efficient and service and government
just and stimulating taxation.
To sustainable economic
growth to preserve the welfare state,
We will also strengthen innovation and entrepreneurship as an economic ground current in Flanders and Belgium so we can excel
as an innovative and economical
growth region. Innovation and entrepreneurship supply dynamics
of growth in an international
competitive environment. The economic fabric, and, in particular,
the manufacturing industry, have a
transformation. The paradigm of
most efficient mass production no longer applies. The industry
must competencies of various companies, knowledge institutes and government policy
put together and develop smart solutions where worldwide
need for it. So take the aging population, the scarcity of resources, climate change and
the increasing need for new mobility solutions. On base

and entrepreneurship are levers
Sustainable solutions
major societal challenges
in the fields of environment, energy,
care and inclusion. Innovation and entrepreneurship assume
availability of financing and
risk capital and an environment where government, education and
business hands reaching out.
The Copernican revolution
is a fact
Thanks to CD & V is the end of 2013 achieved a new important phase in the state reform. 19
in December 2013 the federal parliament approved the legislation last
well. Going over 20 billion euros
to the communities and
regions. The Flemish budget
is thus greater than that of the federal government. The Copernican
rotation is a fact.
We have our socio-economic
plan "3D plan" baptized. 3D because
Assuming three dimensions: economic, social and a third
dimension which we call the social substructure. A socio-economic model can indeed
but work on a solid foundation of social rights
and duties. A basis of legal and justice. And above on a foundation of social
tissue, a network of volunteers. A warm and prosperous society is much more than
the sum of the market and government.
From mid 2014 the Flemish government can decide on the future of the family, about
the policy for the elderly, the
target group policy on the labor market, etc. The 6th state reform, the Flemish government
a policy that more tailored
the has Fleming, from the cradle to
his old age.
Another striking part
This is the state reform
much greater degree of tax autonomy for the regions. In
the future of every four euros
to personal one euro
go directly to the Flemish government. Moreover, the government will also be able to decide
tax benefits for housing and
construction, energy, monuments, etc.
For each of these three dimensions are
we face major challenges. But the
new levers of the 6th state reform also offer us more
chances than ever to find new ways
to succeed, to bold choices
to make. The choices of CD & V will be 3D: Clear, Durable and
Targeted.

Simple and transparent: a simpler tax system ensures that taxpayers understand the system and that the administration can work more efficiently.

A tax reform should lead to a reduction in the burden on labor.
Such reform requires significant financial resources. The IMF,

environmental permit and the decree complex investment projects come into force,
a lot of investment projects will be effectively achieved faster.
Nevertheless, there remains still work on the shelf. CD & V hopes that all investment projects are implemented within a reasonable timeframe. The party advocates:
• An evaluation of the measures taken in the previous legislature, such as the unique
environmental permit, and adjustments where necessary;
• drafting and remediate an inventory of administrative and procedural
obstacles to the rapid realization of smaller investment projects;
• clear priority of the public interest over individual interest. This principle we incorporate into the legislation. With respect to proactive participation

therefore increase, so that the transport system would not stop.

In order to maintain access to economic gateways in Flanders smoothly through road
water greater effort is needed. The
current Flemish Government has therefore
decided six sustainable road and waterway projects for 750 million euros
launch through public-private partnerships. Projects that are not only important
for the economy, but equally
for road safety and the environment. The
previous legislature were all important infrastructure works realized on the road. In Lummen

places were constructed lanes,
as the E34 Antwerp Ranst and
E40 between Sterrebeek and Leuven. The
Kempen North-South axis, the R4
in the south of Ghent and the North
access to the airport in Zaventem were realized.

We want to remain accessible, improve road safety and further develop our region as an innovative,
logistics growth area. It is a lasting development of an efficient, safe
and a sustainable mobility network
of the main keys. A good
opening up our ports, our airports, our capital and the city center is vital to our prosperity and
quality of life. It is also important that the user of the mobility system pays a fair price

Together with the Flemish municipalities and other providers let's develop part-time artistic creativity and artistic skills in children and (young) adults. We guarantee the proximity and accessibility and encourage close collaboration with compulsory education and leisure operators.
The evaluation of adult education should lead to at least that many more
people access to lifelong and life-wide. We choose a scale and regulatory harmonization contributing to a higher participation and the quality of adult education and adult basic education.

they organize and provide education. They are responsible for the effective use of
available resources and the best use of staff and lay there for at

Let subsidiarity full play and give the school back to the students,
teachers and management. We want deregulation, strong, not stifling
quality and a reduction in the administrative burden for teachers and
managing board. We reaffirm our confidence in governments to take responsibility
for our education and set forth constructive dialogue, particularly with partners
which have a large representation.
The evaluation of the operational resources in elementary and secondary education leads
that all schools have adequate resources to reality every student involved and to ensure that state education. Again, we work out the difference between
nursery and primary school.
We encourage elementary and secondary education an administrative scale that
allows school boards to meet the challenges of the future. Also in new

BUILDING BLOCK 6
A JOBS PACT THROUGH A MODERN
SOCIAL DIALOGUE

JOBS PACT
AND MODERN
SOCIAL
CONCERT

Social dialogue has since the Second World War laid the foundation for a long
period of economic prosperity. Chords left always a trade-off between the
increasing productivity, wage increases, working conditions and an expansion of social security. Sufficient growth was therefore an essential component in this
model. That explains why the discussions in recent years is difficult. The
average growth rate is dropped from over more than 3% per year to less than 1% at present. The
lubricant for the consultation is exhausted.
The first lesson is that growth remains important. Without growth, social redistribution is much
harder: what does one more, the other takes less. But realism is due:
where we have many decades of great productivity leaps have been able to make thanks to the integration of improved technologies and production processes, we now own the
pushing technological boundaries through innovation. The social dialogue must make the change to the new realities of innovation and knowledge economy. Moreover
causes the aging of the population for additional pressure on our growth opportunities. We
can not blindly trust that we will grow our problems.
For some, the lack of results at the inter-professional level is an argument to identify the essence of social dialogue in question and put more power
in politics. So does the number of agreements reached or even great dishonor.
Also interprofessional there are still partners who take responsibility
and reach agreements, as recently shown in the file collar workers. The
question is not at all whether we like social consultation is important. We are convinced
but that action could lead to sustainable results if they are widely accepted.
Such behavior of can only be achieved through ongoing consultations with the social
partners. They bring expertise into the decision. Problems do not disappear
by not talking about it. It is therefore especially important to order a new impetus to
indicate the consultations.
The second lesson is why we also have to put the social dialogue under a magnifying glass. How can we change this agreement so that it is proven
value reserves? That is of course not a question of politics alone. We have
need for a new Social Pact. A pact between the government and the social partners.
A Social Pact provides a strong response to the challenges of our social model and
leading to a more efficient and effective use of budgets.

• Local CD & V wants strong partnerships for the activation of young school leavers, especially the young people who leave school without qualifications.
The local council or the group of local authorities must make arrangements with
VDAB, with schools, welfare workers and companies.
With the local authorities we want to investigate how the Gesco system can contribute to a

agreements on the regularization of Gesco's local government.
Flemish social dialogue
CD & V would like Flemish collective agreements are widespread input. Collective agreements that are the result
consultations between representatives of workers and employers in the Flemish region, should be declared generally binding by the Federal Minister of
Work. For example, this can come in Flanders a tradeoff between

It is clear that a number of developments including with respect to the care and welfare

Meanwhile, these sectors account for a substantial part of the economy;

State reform done by the regions and communities. Such a demand for (co-) management also assumes - as at the federal level
in Social Security is the case through the financing of social security -
an empowerment of the actors involved.
• However, the Flemish government's vision of CD & V Flemish social protection in Flanders - that enhance people - and from the need for a highly dynamic regional economic policies; - Unabridged

which they change is higher than ever and continues to accelerate. Make a number of phenomena, in Flanders and elsewhere, which increases the need for care and support and
for years will continue to do. People get older. Gradually, there are proportionally
more elderly. Therefore there are more chronic diseases. Two observations intervene at each other. People tend to be more concerned about themselves than to others.
Society 'personalize'. Its social fabric thin, brittle and no longer
self-evident. The second observation is that we shift from acute care to more
chronic care and residential care to outpatient care, home care, care by
healthcare professionals and so-called carers, people in the social network of the person who needs care. The society is moving towards a new
balance. In this movement we are building in Flanders avoid social guarantees in which insecurity and alleviate emergency care.
After the 6th state reform Flanders will decide itself about rehabilitation, mental
healthcare, aged care, prevention and primary care, about compensations in
assistance to the elderly, mobility aids and allowances. This makes a coherent, transparent welfare policies and social protection tailored to the Fleming possible. Then there is a good cooperation with the federal level of major importance for

The VSB is financed by general taxation and a premium of all

Shift from acute to chronic care
The shift from acute to chronic care means that the priorities right
funding shift and requires a different organization of care. That would mean:
• that we are moving from acute reactive to proactive and planned care and a
disease-oriented medical model to a demand-oriented multidisciplinary model,
• home care and care that we are expanding beyond the walls of the hospital or nursing home. Together with the patient and the caregiver, we propose a
personalized care plan. Caregivers and healthcare providers share information about
emergency care and there is an appropriate funding to support the collaboration of various health care stakeholders. The latter assumes that we adjust the financing instruments.

-lived career. Longer average career enhance the financial sustainability
of the system and the individual prosperity
of the pensioner.
We explicitly opt for a retirement career, more than a retirement. Thus we stress
a pension based primarily on contributions that happened
during the active career. What counts is
the number of years a person is working and contributing. We want to seek full
careers of 45 years of career. We reserve the statutory retirement
65 years as the time when desired rights can be opened,
but this should not be a barrier to whom
wants to stay longer in the workforce.

We achieve more transparency.
Everyone should be directing its
own careers and informed choices
can make. With a career planning system (CPS) it should be possible
to have in order to view at all times
the impact of part-time work, time credits, etc. on the pension.
Career Choices often have profound implications for retirement. People
they must therefore be able to make, on the basis
of very clear, accessible and clear information and with the help of professional helpdesks.

A pension reform is only one way to achieve longer working lives.
The labor market, we need to reform, for example by having lower labor costs are for older workers and the availability of education.
Statements made in equal pension
also help to achieve longer effective working lives. We do want the periods

Beyond that increased selectivity is required.

For the accrual of pension rights
we must be sensitive to new forms of society. The accumulated
statutory and supplementary pension rights in case of divorce or dissolution of the legal cohabitation alike
be distributed among the partners.

Enabling of longer working lives we require that the differences between
evaluate the systems for calculating pensions. These are often a constraint on labor mobility and therefore longer working lives. The (objectification) differences
between systems (employee, self-employed, civil servants) are therefore made gradually smaller and the negative
consequences of a mixed career
pension we eliminate.

We want to reduce the risk of poverty. This means that each pensioner has a standard of living above the
European poverty threshold. Even those who already
a while retired, should not in
end poverty.

INVESTING IN HIGH-QUALITY
LIVING ENVIRONMENT
When we want to encourage people to build a prosperous society, we must ensure that they too can live, work and relax in a quality environment. We invest in a healthy environment under
the motto 'sensible green. The air quality plan, the climate policy plan and materials are examples of how ecology and economy are communicating vessels.
The results are there: air and water quality have improved over the past decade and fierce
we meet the Kyoto standard. There were never so many in forest and nature recreation.
We must reconcile numerous functions in one: living, working, culture, relax,
agriculture and nature. Flanders is too small to divide it into separate area where we already
those functions can experience. Where possible, so we combine functions. We do so both in urban and rural areas. Both have their specific strengths and challenges. Both deserve a tailored policy. CD & V in rural areas is not a rest area!
The communication back and forth with the 4th module - investing in Smart Grids
energy, mobility and information - is a prerequisite for successful progress.
Investments in renewable energy, in smooth and safe mobility and the free access to public information are the foundations of a quality living environment.
In this socio-economic plan we highlight four investment environment:
• affordable housing and quality;
• thriving trade;
• tourism and catering;
• infrastructure for sports, culture and youth.

That the hospitality industry should continue 'verwitten' is beyond dispute. The introduction of the registered
cash register with fiscal control module ('black') therefore remains useful. But not at the
the expense of the diversity of supply in the hospitality industry. We foresee a period of application of the registered cash register until January 1st, 2016 so that pub owners can

central distribution sites. Its delivery is done with quieter vehicles and with low noise loading and unloading equipment.

8.3. Attractive catering and tourism
The tourism industry is in Europe a growth economy which even in difficult times
performs. We continue to work on a full-fledged tourist product for the
Coast, the Flemish Art Cities and Regions. We do this in partnership with the private sector, with specific focus on strategic planning, product development,
marketing, communication and distribution.
For the tourist and catering establishments, these are the priorities of CD & V:
• tourism in their region through high quality walking and cycling networks;
• promotion of Flemish tourist attractions and convention tourism in inland and
abroad. The economic value of tourism can surely be enhanced by the involvement of local businesses in the tourism and city marketing story;
• Fire safe accommodation;
• Social tourism and family tourism, by upgrading kwalitateitsvolle family hotels and campsites;
• farm tourism.
The hospitality industry is in the DNA of the Fleming and is woven into our social life. The catering industry
is a source of employment and at the same time of relaxation and social networking.
CD & V will remain fully support the Flemish café and food culture, both popular café
as the star restaurant.

purposeful choices we make in socio-economic terms. We want to continue the budget
placing order but at the same time reduce the labor costs, achieve social progress and
invest in the future. We also proved immediately that those priorities and achievable
are affordable.
Central to our program is the welfare triangle. Of the nine blocks in which

part of our election a number of building blocks to be further explored.
This concerns eg. To mobility, education or culture. These are areas that indeed many
More spacious than the socio-economic aspects that have already been treated. The ninth
building block - social security - was even uncharted territory. A
strong economy and a good social protection also requires that social
substructure on point. The third dimension in our 3D plan is just as important
as the other two. Businesses and families will only develop when activities
sufficient legal certainty. Initiative from the community can only fully flourish if the government sets the right framework.
The foreign policy is in this second part discussed. We therefore also refer
even to the CD & V program for the European elections. A warm Flanders
is an open Flanders. As a small country in the heart of Europe, we must look to the
holding world. Solidarity should not stop at our borders.
Before starting the various policy areas, we stand here briefly at three
more cross-cutting themes, themes that are acquired throughout the text: the interpretation that
we provide a caring society, the enduring partnership between CD & V and
families and our interpretation of the positive confederalism.

Respectful and caring society
Cohabitation will talk about freedom and taking responsibility, about being free
as a person and also a commitment to develop the other, its own talents
the service of the other. As Christian Democrats, we absolutise neither the individual nor
the community. We go again and again to find the right balance between
both. Respect for each unique human being, who is in the situation where, regardless of the
qualities that a person prevails that. Every human being deserves respect and the
most of all vulnerable, defenseless man. Just when people are most vulnerable,
they deserve special care.

5.1. Foreign policy
Our proposals regarding the European policy can be found in our European election.
Our country is increasingly dependent on foreign countries. About employment, prosperity
and welfare in Flanders and Belgium is increasingly beyond national borders
decides. Export is crucial to our economy. Our businesses operate in a competitive international environment. The supply of raw materials and energy supply
are to a large extent determined by stability and instability elsewhere. Flanders and
Belgium are not spared from the effects of global migration, terrorist networks, human trafficking and climate change. There is rightly annoyed about
the poverty gap and there is need for a more equitable distribution of wealth.
More than enough reasons to pay attention to what happens outside our borders.
It is important that our foreign policy is based on an understanding of our
interests and values ​​in Europe and the world. This is about our political, economic, social, cultural and security interests, and the interests of Belgians and
Flemings abroad. But if we work for peace, security, prosperity and progress, then we do not only selfish but also because of values
we cherish and want to carry into the world, solidarity and respect for human
dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Our foreign policy must be supported by a diplomacy aimed at excellence
on results and progress on international cooperation and commitment on viable compromise and consensus, rather than on profiling and confrontation. In diplomacy
the process is as important as position.
It is essential that our foreign policy is a good reflection of the cohesion
between the layered levels of government in Belgium. Both the states and the federal
Government should see defended their interests in our diplomacy.
CD & V would like to ...
• An own Flemish foreign policy, with a strong focus on the European Union and
our neighboring countries, focusing on the promotion of our exports and attracting
foreign investment, with a focus on our strengths abroad
which also made appropriate use of academic and cultural diplomacy, and with continued attention to development in southern Africa;
