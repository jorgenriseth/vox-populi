The 2013-2017 government program calls for the company to give continuity to the government of the Citizen Revolution. In the political moment which opens with the 2013 elections require all public support for innovation, radicalize and deepen compliance and resolving social demands. It is to continue to govern and govern innovate; to govern for further change.

Program conceived as a set of principles, objectives and policy proposals to the broader social and political coordination with all those wills of Ecuador aspire to an active and sovereign homeland. This text provides an extensive range of proposals and lines of action for the next four years, a real agenda of the Citizen Revolution to be implemented by the Government and the National Assembly.

The document built by everyone, Ecuador and Ecuador, members of the Alianza País movement of all and each of the territories, leaders and members of many social organizations, organic intellectuals and prominent dignitaries of our government, public servants and specialists all branches of knowledge and technology, seeks to consolidate and project the project that brings us together.

This program presents ten revolutions that make our current proposal. We have enriched the government program in 2006. At that time are five revolutions, the constitutional and democratic revolution; Ethics Revolution: front to combat corruption; economic and productive revolution: education and health revolution; and revolution for dignity, sovereignty and Latin American integration. In a second stage, in the framework of the First National Convention of the PAIS Alliance Movement, held in November 2010, we expanded our horizons with two additional revolutions: the green revolution and the revolution of justice.

Our experience of government, the current political and social context, along with the reflections and debates that have taken place during the last two years, led us to formulate new challenges and objectives. Government Programme 2013-2017 includes three new revolutions: the knowledge revolution, the urban revolution and cultural revolution.

Our revolutions are brought together to form the 35 program proposals PAIS Alliance presented here, and now you have in your hands. It is a program that you all should know Ecuadorians to join our political decision in the next elections. Read it, I discuss it and difúndanlo family, with friends in the neighborhood.

Economic, productive and labor Revolution
Posted on November 19, 2012 by pgpais
"We will dominate the markets, to create the National System of Food marketing and product marketing chains in different parts of the country without intermediaries. INCOP must prioritize and regulate public procurement producers and family farming Solidarity Economy ... " . Nelson Coello, Building Workshop Program Government, Santo Domingo de los Tsáchilas.

Ecuador has left behind the books of Orthodox texts and raises a new economic thinking and praxis. International bodies such as the IMF and World Bank remained floating about good and evil, but the Ecuador found out to drive them into place. The office of the IMF, who spent many years staying at the Central Bank is no longer there, finally he disappeared from Ecuador, where the national bank recovered its sovereignty. Our foreign loans are now going to meet the country's needs and target our ambitious plans for productive investment.

We no longer govern fiscal macro absurd rules that previously prevented investment in education and health, and our economy undergoing respond to timely payment of external debt by creditors. Today we have stability to consolidate the regime of good living.

We had a successful renegotiation of the foreign debt that allowed the country to save more than seven billion dollars. We generate a renewed vision of the economy, as our Constitution allows us now to open a stage for other economies: private, mixed, public grassroots solidarity. We build an economy whose central axis is the productive human being as dignified worker.

We seek an economy that is seated in the productive capacities of Ecuadorians. Our people are industrious and hardworking, as it has always been. Work is the essence and the vehicle of change which allows us greater production. Production raised the challenge of productivity that allows us to also raise the consumption necessary for reproduction of life. We do not believe in consumerism (the "iron cage" of consumerism), the anxiety that dominates modern society that has led us capitalism worn. A fair and balanced intake is what allows us a real quality of life, without bind us dependencies of any kind. We believe in a sustainable economy and efficiency in the use of natural and energy resources, a balance is maintained with proper use and recycling; an economy that finds support in justice and tax fairness. We start from the premise that those who have more pay. We want a decentralized and desmonopolizada economy.

We recognize the value of women's work at home, in the care economy, which enables reproduction of everyday people. We value the work not underestimate. Our economy stands on the economically active population, and not the work of children and adolescents, who must take his time in the studio quality. We guarantee full employment and social security coverage, without exploiting domestic workers. We have finally eliminated outsourcing.

We consider it essential distribution and redistribution, but at the same time generating significant productivity, since we find no contradiction between them. This is the new economy we build in practice and deepen today. It is an economy that is recognized in the global world and that does not keep us tied or subordinated to the disastrous rule of capital, now submitted to the European countries and major economies in the world.

Unlike the neoliberal era in our economy stumbles not weaker. When we want to redistribute the strongest we affect. There is for example the law of "Redistribution of social spending", which was sent on an urgent basis in economic matters by the Executive to the National Assembly on October 25, 2012.

There is no better way to move that EI revenues to new sectors that will allow us to leave our historical dependence on natural resources: power generation, telecommunication quality, increased internet, adequate refining our natural resources.

Therefore, we propose a quite clear that part of the need to strengthen the change in the way we produce, ie the consolidation of a productive matrix different horizon.

Change the production structure to diversify the economy, boost productivity, ensure national sovereignty and leave the primary-export dependence.

The nineteenth century defined the place of Ecuador, like most Latin American countries, in the international division of labor. Since its inception, it began his role as a provider of primary goods from agriculture and the -intensiva recolección- and mining. These resources gave you the ability to finance the import of industrial manufactures that had a higher technological component.

The productive and social base, which has supported this specialized form of integration into the world economy, has been prone to the concentration of a few products, markets and ownership of the means of production. If we look back, it turned out that global demand was what, ultimately determined that kind of route condemning the country, to place it in an extreme circumstance of vulnerability to frequent crises of central capitalism.

This potted history reminds us of the urgency and importance of the change of productive matrix of Ecuador, to face a different process of accumulation and internal expertise. In other words, we need the contribution of intelligence and creativity in the production of Ecuadorians to exchange and cooperate with new places in the world.

We can not forget that the structure of international trade is characterized by unequal exchange. Is more likely to modify their productive matrix Ecuador, it is a decision of internal public policy. And it is less likely that an unequal world-from false freedom of trade-transparency is willing to trade patterns to counter the unequal exchange on the planet. This moment is unique. We can not lose sight.

The most serious structural problem that threatens the sustainability of the Ecuadorian Macroeconomics is the deficit of the non-oil trade balance. Imports are growing much faster than our non-oil exports, which is a threat to our economy. The macroeconomic implications of this phenomenon are felt in the daily life, as local companies can not compete with other products that come from the outside; our consumer trends are oriented towards imported goods; our daily spending benefits increasingly generating work abroad. Tariffs, import restrictions, among others: to achieve reverse this trend and to have no exchange rate policy following the dollarization, measures related to the balance of payments are required. These measures are necessary but not sufficient, what we need is the productive transformation with selective import substitution, diversification of exports and the establishment of priority industries.

Import substitution involves creating and producing within the country what we are importing from abroad. There are billions of dollars in assets that we can produce in the country and require little effort to accomplish them. To this we must establish regulations and incentives. In the area of ​​goods and services produced by the state, and have good results as in the case of electricity. In the area of ​​goods produced by private, we will encourage domestic production. Much has to do with the support to producers through credit, appropriate prices, provision of inputs and raw materials, the supply of trained human talent for these production processes, among others. Another part has to do with the demand: the state buys more than US $ 10 billion annually in goods and services, which can be directed to promote import substitution through long-term contracts and preferences for domestic producers. However, the main demand for imported goods come from the private sector, consumers. Society must assume responsibility for consumer rights, preferring national to imported. For this, we will implement a series of regulatory measures (price, technical standards, tariffs, prohibitions) and advocacy (information and publicity campaigns preference ours, awareness of consumption practices).

But the deficit must also be reduced with increased exports. Decompose the problem is key in increasing amounts over the same, more products and product value. The essential thing is the diversification of exports with higher added value. The State must be accompanied with the right incentives and regulations for the private sector and the popular and solidarity sector to boost its exports to most destinations. Export promotion is one of the fundamental tools that can open opportunities in the world for Ecuadorian enterprises.

As a catalyst for productive transformation process, the establishment of basic industries, large scale, to enable the country provided the goods necessary to drive the industrialization process is required. The transformation of minerals, the formation of a petrochemical industry and steel and metalworking industries are prime targets for moving towards structural transformation. Policies should be settled down in the territory, according to their needs and potential.

There is already a huge effort by the State, through public investment in infrastructure provision for systemic productivity. Roads, transport infrastructure, reducing the cost of energy, logistics facilitation and telecommunications are examples of investment for systemic productivity. These investments contribute significantly to reducing the costs of undertaking. The State must also allocate resources to enable citizens to be pillars of changing production patterns through the formation of a strong human, healthy and educated for incorporating knowledge in production processes talent.

Foreign investment should be complementary to public investment and domestic investment. The state should regulate and control that capital meets business ethics but also performance requirements. Technology transfer and the generation of added value should be the fruits that we leave foreign investment.

"One of our concerns is who will be immersed in this necessary change of production model of the country and how the state will include new actors, so strengthening the social organization as a necessary productivity" . Estuto José Lino (farmer) Building Workshop Government Program, Santa Elena.

LINES OF ACTION

• Transforming knowledge into wealth: joint scientific and technological research and higher education, with the productive economy. Universities, polytechnics and technical and technological institutes must be in constant dialogue with the productive sectors and meet their needs within the framework of national planning. This strategic alliance are mutual benefits will translate into production, education and the generation of new knowledge improvements.

• Increase and guide investment in science, technology and innovation, in order to have solid cores of research and technological development in the country. This will allow the generation of knowledge necesariospara produce goods and services that meet the needs of the country and allow us to insert ourselves strategically in the world.

• Develop the five key strategic industries for changing the productive matrix: refinery, shipyard, petrochemical, metallurgy of copper and steel.

• Consolidate the productive transformation of products of the fourteen priority sectors: tourism; fresh and processed foods; renewable energy; pharmaceuticals and chemicals; Biotechnology: Biochemical and biomedicine; environmental services; metalworking; technology: hardware and software; plastics and synthetic rubber; apparel, clothing and footwear; vehicles, motor vehicles, bodies and parts; transport and logistics; construction; and sustainable forest chain and processed wood products.

• Implement innovation and technology transfer for producers of the priority sectors in order to increase their competitiveness and adding value.

• Encourage the efficient use of energy and resources, energy conservation and renewal of industrial equipment to increase productive capacities. Competitive and environmental challenges force produce better and achieve higher levels of efficiency in the use of all our resources.

• Continue to invest in logistics and infrastructure. We will continue to drive the multimodal transport: roads, highways, ports and air transport and railways. These actions allow transport the goods and services markets safer and less costly and more efficient in energy use manner. It is also important to maintain constant updating and quality of telecommunications services.

• To encourage the diversification of production, promoting production linkages and internal multipliers. The state has a number of mechanisms that should be articulated with the structural transformation of the country. Through public and private investment can promote initiatives that enhance domestic production, job generation and allow ensure that the whole cycle of production is articulated (from raw materials to finished products with added value). To this must be optimally manage resources. Public procurement and tariff and para-tariff policy are important elements to encourage domestic production.

• Find mechanisms to promote domestic production in the domestic market, to encourage consumption Ecuadorian products. Thus boosts the national economy. First ours!

• Promote the productive decentralization as part of changing the productive matrix and achieve a polycentric development.

• Implement direct import of certain inputs for production, in order to remove the chains of intermediation and prevent prices of these inputs in the country are higher than in their home countries.

• Strengthen the National Institute of Standardization, to have national standards for quality and supply of goods and services, known by all productive and service sectors of the country.

• Consolidate domestic markets and open new foreign markets to ensure the success of new ventures. Domestically, reduce intermediation to reduce the price gap between producer and consumer.

Markets govern, control and regulate monopolies capital to make it serve the common good and work

Work is the main source for human life. Our sense of public policy focuses on the job. A stable, well-paid work and quality. So our continued intransigence to highlight the work on capital. To achieve these principles we need to clearly define the scope of the State; need to rule the market, understood as changing social institutions over time. A solid state governed society and active markets are a substantial part of our proposal.

The state is the representation of the general interest of the common good, we know. There is a theory that tells us the "optimal" size of government, as it depends on political, cultural, institutional and economic factors.

The "economic" state intervention in the economy is consistent, on any view, to fill gaps in the markets. And the famous Hungarian social scientist and philosopher Karl Polanyi, over half a century ago, we said that "the market is a good servant but a bad master."

We will continue with the regulation and control of financial capital, so that never again is threatening our tanks, so you never have another financial crisis. By the Constitution, the Citizens' Revolution banned the freezing of deposits and bank bailouts; conducted an audit of the banking crisis, it implemented a financial safety net to prevent future crises. We continue to pay the debts to depositors cheated in the late 1990s continue fixing the interest rates and service fees and will pay more attention to banks allocate more loans to productive activities.

We have made great strides in reducing the power of the major economic groups. The State seized the properties of corrupt bankers who caused the crisis of 1998 and 1999, as no other government dared to take. We also prohibit banks linking with other companies in the real sector, including the perverse and threatening combination with certain media.

The Constitution establishes as a priority duty of the state to avoid monopolistic and oligopolistic practices, particularly in the private sector, and others that affect the functioning of markets, promoting equitable access to the means of production, avoiding the concentration or hoarding of factors and productive resources, redistribution and removal of privileges or inequalities in access to them. We have reduced the income of economically powerful groups who looted us in the past: transnational oil speculators and foreign debt.

Similarly, it is for the State to promote the reduction of distortions of intermediation, ensuring transparency and market efficiency by promoting competition and equal opportunities. To achieve govern the markets, the Citizen Revolution promoted and approved the Organic Law for the Regulation and Control of Market Power, to curb the abuses of big business at the expense of entrepreneurial initiative of the Ecuadorian people.

To regulate the return on capital not settle in labor exploitation by regulating living wage. Shareholders can not distribute all the profits while workers do not have a fee to cover the basic food basket. Recall also that, apart from all control measures in the workplace, during the crisis of central capitalism, the measures taken by Ecuador did not affect the workers.

"It is necessary to adapt the different institutions, policies, management and financing to expanding the Solidarity Economy. Access to productive infrastructure companies with mixed or solidarity for the industrialization and commercialization of products, regulation of credit for private and public banks to orient production ... " . Carmen Dolores jumps, Building Workshop Government Program Solidarity Economy actors.

LINES OF ACTION

Maintain economic stability with a maximum level of employment and production, ensuring fiscal, external and financial sustainability.
Channel credit to the productive and work-generating activities.
Apply mechanisms to ensure control in the exit and entry of capital and currencies. This will, on the one hand, improve the inherent stability of the economy and act as a protective mechanism against shocks in the external sector; and, moreover, it facilitates the management of domestic liquidity for channeling domestic savings into productive sectors. The overall objective of this initiative is to repatriate the greatest national savings to be channeled into productive activities to better face any external crisis and promote structural changes in the productive matrix and generating jobs. We continue to implement the new domestic financial architecture.
Enhance the "mobile money". This mode will allow citizens making and receiving payments from anywhere in the country, safely and without loss of time or need to be transported increasing transactional speed of the economy. We continue with the regulation and control of means of payment such as credit cards, checks and other instruments to avoid monopolies and excessive charges for its use.
Continue with the regulation and control of the banking, insurance and other financial institutions, in line with macro lenses and microeconómicos- limiting its economic power and its relationship with political power. We will not allow another financial crisis in the country; We continue transformed the system to the private financial capital at the service of the productive system and the generation of employment.
Consolidate, promote and strengthen the popular and supportive financial sector as an alternative to the bench, so that it is a great ally of public policy to finance productive investment.
Boosting public development banks for changing the productive matrix, financial inclusion, territorial development and social housing.
Strengthen consumer protection citizen of the financial system and financial education.
Encourage the participation of productive units in the stock market and the venture capital fund for businesses.
Abusive attack intermediation margins faced by our producers, particularly peasant producers. This will be done by implementing an active policy of pricing incentives association and true market competition to bring producers and consumers.
Facilitate entrepreneurship of micro, small and medium production units simplifying procedures, so that the burden of regulation and control is not controlled but in the controller. This is not achieved by unnecessary bureaucracy to ask for copies of documents, but through the interoperation of systems of the same State, and technological modernization. We will make huge efforts to train people in the use of information and communication technologies.
Punish abuses of market power of any kind.

Proposal 3. To the people what is the people!
Posted on November 21, 2012 by pgpais
Democratize the means of production (capital, land, credit, technology, knowledge, water) and markets to build an inclusive and plural economy

Inequality is a defining characteristic of the countries of Latin America. This inequality can be seen on our continent symbolized by the presence of the world's richest man and the poorest man in terms of deprivation. Inequality condemning generations.

You attack inequality becomes an economic, political, social and ethical imperative. We have managed to reverse income inequality dropped neoliberalism with active public policies. However, we can not lose heart but continue in our mission. It is necessary to facilitate access to the means of production, market and credit, as one of the exits to continue carrying on with the government of the Citizen Revolution.Redistribution can resolve the immediate problems faced by much of the Ecuadorian population, and contributes to modify the structural basis for a new pattern of fairer accumulation. The challenge is twofold: to redistribute wealth so that no one suffers from poverty and exclusion, nor any basic need. This order must be accompanied by long-term policies to change the basis for an economic partnership that distributes increasingly to divide their means of production and products. Redistribution is intended to reconcile short-term emergency and structural transformations for Ecuador of all for all.

The Citizen Revolution will continue to drive the democratization of access to the means of production to enable management of production processes that allow producers to join the commercial circuits of economic and productive play. The bet democratization of the means of production has to be done considering the plurality of economic and social reality of the country. We should advance distributive justice of the land and water; we also have an impact on the financial capital, fixing their attention on access and distribution of credit. It is necessary to prioritize the activities of small and medium-sized production units, enabling increased levels of quality employment and income, promoting flexibility of capital and not labor. Education and knowledge are the other pillar, and not just qualifications of the workforce, but as a common good that must be distributed equitably among the population.

The initial distribution of the means of production implies a condition sine qua non for the equitable utilization in terms of improved productivity. Transition to democracy of the economy calls for promoting improved productivity of producers strata of goods aimed at satisfying the demand of the majority of the population, where most of the workforce is concentrated. That is why we advocate the democratization of the economy implies changes in domestic productive apparatus, which not only achieve product diversification, but also to producers. This requires structural changes in the agricultural, technological and financial sector, which contribute to the creation of new small and medium producers, to invert the pyramid of productive concentration that Ecuador has inherited for centuries.

"State investment is needed to industrialize primary products in the same territory, by creating supportive agricultural companies or mixed economy, state - Organizations. Promoting conditions that enable stakeholder access to family farming to production factors throughout the value chain and its linkage to markets " . Fausto Tandapilco, Building Workshop Government Program, Bolivar.

LINES OF ACTION

• Implement the national information management system and rural land. The land redistribution will take place not only in terms of its size but also its quality and encourage private land ownership and community, in accordance with the population of each territory.

• Optimize state roads and irrigation infrastructure to improve production on land with limited access to water and more isolated. Implement major projects for territorial equity distribute water sources. The distribution and redistribution of water are a priority.

• include technology transfer, training, supervision, access to production inputs, credit and markets, that these lands become active to contribute to improving the living conditions of people.

• To promote a revolution in productivity. It is to turn around the current levels of productivity. In the case of agro walk towards universal use of seeds with the promotion of research as well as the multiplication and distribution of seeds from associative or private nurseries.

• Promote full use of public and private infrastructure for production and commercial activities.

• To democratize access to knowledge, by providing the infrastructure that society make free use of Internet possible, enjoy the network of public libraries and educational offer adapted to all levels of education, age groups, learning preconditions and territorial dispersion. Promote the use of free software in the state and society.

• Implement production information systems and open, universal and truly democratic prices for better functioning of markets, facilitating contact between producers and consumers. Infrastructure and democratize the radio spectrum for economic information asymmetry and reduce leverage.

• Foster the supply of scientific and technological resources for communities, individuals and local authorities, in order to stimulate the process of aggregation among the weakest productive and economic subjects. It seeks to launch economic initiatives that enhance the territories, communities and proposals for economic improvement of the workers themselves.

• Designing specific auctions workers and communities of real and personal property received in lieu of payment in public banks. Implement specific lines for the purchase of such goods credit.

• Provide company shares seized from the workers themselves, including the media seized. Put seized enterprises serving the community through its conversion to public companies or by forming joint ventures with producers.

• Promote and require opening up the capital of private companies in the stock market, to democratize. Regular participation of workers in bodies of governance of private enterprises, and Germany.

• Continue to ensure the right to organize, within the framework of the Constitution and the policy of elimination of labor exploitation. Condition mergers and acquisitions between companies to the democratization of capital to workers and the community.

• Ensure redistribution of surplus on land and urban property, especially given the important public works and the recovery of public spaces. Strengthening the capacity of tax collection of GADs.

• Channel credit for productive and job-generating activities. Increase the term of loans and develop funding mechanisms for innovation and production and technology investment. Restructuring the public banks continue to serve as an effective instrument of democratization of capital. Remove the evil system of credit bureau pro-capital and revolutionize the system of credit guarantees to facilitate access to credit. Regular savings to reinvest territory evenly inside to avoid the centralization of capital.

• Continue to improve tax collection gradually, and closing tax avoidance mechanisms. Continue controlling behaviors related to illicit as money laundering and implement the popular mandate to criminalize not justified enrichment activities.

• continue democratizing the social acquis. Trawling will be removed in favor of the productivity of artisanal fishermen. The mines will be worked in partnership between the state enterprise and small miners and will not be subject to illegal operators. We will promote associative productive forest policies and eliminate illegal logging.

Consolidate the transformation of strategic sectors and the sovereign and efficient use of natural resources to enhance the quality of life of citizens 

The Constitution of Montecristi strategic sectors defined as those whose importance and magnitude have decisive economic, social, political or environmental influence in the country, and are oriented to the full development of the rights of citizens and the public interest. They have been classified as strategic sectors that compromise the use of non-renewable natural resources such as oil and mining, and renewable natural resources such as water. They have also been classified as strategic the electricity and telecommunications sectors.

The new concept of strategic sectors forced the state to assume its stewardship role in each of these areas. It was essential to design and implement an institutional framework that would ensure his new role, considering that most of these activities were in private hands or a State completely dismantled by neglect calculated from the long night of neoliberalism and lack of public policies and regulations ensure the overall economic interest of this work.

We set out to make the management of strategic sectors in the real tool to achieve social and economic development. This involved setting three basic areas: achieving systemic competitiveness, exercise sovereignty in the energy field and improve equity and the distribution of income and opportunities for underserved segments of society. In the Agenda for Strategic Sectors, these axes were designated as productive Ecuador, sovereign and inclusive Ecuador Ecuador.

One of the priority actions aimed at the achievement of the objectives was to transform the energy matrix. From the point of view of telecommunications posed the biggest challenge was the increasing levels of access and expansion of the telephone network and the Internet.

Globally cumulative investment in projects of strategic sectors in the period 2007 - 2012 exceeds US $ 16,000 million.

In the hydrocarbon area contracts with private operators were renegotiated, which has allowed the State to have the appropriate involvement of the exploitation of natural resources, as under the new mode of service delivery contracts for exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons is signed . Thanks to the renegotiation of oil contracts, 100% of the increase in the international price of oil is for all Ecuadorians. Revenues for the state have increased by US $ 2.187 million from January 2011 to May 2012, with respect to revenue would have received without the renegotiation of oil contracts. We are the fifth largest country in the world to receive oil revenues.

The sovereignty over the management of our natural resources has marked important milestones as well as more private investment committed to the new oil contracts in the order of US $ 3,195 million. In the period 2007 - 2012 the total investment in the hydrocarbon sector reached US $ 11.539 million, of which US $ 9,457 correspond to public investments.

In the oil subsector we hope that domestic demand for petroleum is satisfied with the domestic refining.

In the field of oil refining, the country has been working to recover the initial Esmeraldas refinery capacity (110 thousand barrels per day). The Pacific Refinery (RDP) is the largest, ambitious and attractive project in the South Pacific in oil in recent decades. The refinery will process 300,000 barrels per day. The units installed RDP processes used deep conversion technology, required for production of gasoline, distillates, LPG and petrochemical bases. 40% of its production will supply domestic demand and 60% will be exported, which will affect revenues for the Ecuadorian State. This project represents not only for Ecuador crude oil refining earnings, but will become the mainstay of the development of the petrochemical industry. By increasing the supply of electricity generation and oil refining, Ecuador reach its energy sovereignty and become an exporter of products, petroleum products and electricity, with high added value.

One of the greatest achievements that seeks to strengthen the Citizen Revolution is precisely the transformation of the energy matrix, which is oriented to achieve energy sovereignty. The energy in its various forms has become one of the mainstays in the development and growth of peoples. In this line, the Citizen Revolution decided to invest in large quantities in hydroelectric projects remained neglected for decades. It also promotes research, development and implementation of more environmentally friendly energy.

To meet the growing demand for electricity and overcome the anomalies of the past, such as blackouts and energy imports ─consecuencias aplicadas─ inadequate policies, better technologies have been introduced in thermoelectric generation, which has enabled replace the use of diesel imported fuel oil and natural gas that are produced domestically, reducing it from 10% to just 2% in the matrix. All this has been achieved while large hydropower projects are constructed and gradually incorporated into the national system.

For the period 2012-2020 are developing a set of solar, wind, geothermal and hydroelectric projects to increase by approximately 3,000 MW installed capacity and effective reach a total of 7,600 MW in 2016. The hydroelectric plant Coca-Codo-Sinclair 1,500 MW is the flagship project that will change the energy situation in the country. Its electric power accounts for 41% of effective capacity installed in 2011.

The new energy matrix allow the country to generate its own power, to diversify its sources and reduce domestic demand for fossil fuels for electricity generation. This is an opportunity to save financial resources, promoting technological development and implement renewable and sustainable energy that are environmentally friendly: water, wind, solar and geothermal.

Another criterion to consider is the demand and energy consumption. We can not waste non-renewable resources will be critical for future generations. Energy consumption should be consistent with the Good Life. We must eliminate wasteful and unnecessary waste of energy resulting inefficient consumption, encouraging savings and energy efficiency, particularly in the most demanding and less efficient in energy use sectors, such as transport, industry and construction. Will prioritize the development of freight transport systems, based on renewable energy and public transportation for people, it's safe, quality and environmentally friendly, the use of clean technologies in industrial processes and also incentivize construction environmentally friendly, to maximize energy savings.

Mining and mining were reactivated with great responsibility and principles of sustainability and efficiency, with a medium-term direct creation of over 7000 jobs places, with estimated investments of over US $ 5 billion and generating royalties the mining community, mining will become a very short term in Ecuador engine development. The first contract of large scale mining which means an investment of US $ 1,773 million and, most importantly, that 52% of income remains in favor of the Ecuadorian state, the world's largest mining income was signed. These royalties are agreed an advance of US $ 100 million to be invested in Zamora Chinchipe province in which the project is based.

It has been the policy of the Government of the Citizen Revolution equitably redistribute wealth in the country; not only invest 60% of royalties in areas where these projects to exploit natural resources have influence, but 100%. That's why more than US $ 300 million is being invested in several locations for the development of integrated projects in the areas of the Coca Codo Sinclair, Pañacocha Esmeraldas Refinery, Bajo Alto, Zamora, Pacific Refinery, etc. Investment for enabling hospitals, educational units of the millennium, health centers, roads, electricity networks, sanitation and schools equipped with Internet access.

Connectivity Plan has enabled Internet use from 2006 to 2012 quadruple. Only between 2011 and 2012 doubled, now 45% of the Ecuadorian population has access. 1 million 700 thousand students in more than 5,000 public educational establishments have joined the information society. To make this possible it was necessary to build a true backbone fiber optic network nationally, from 1,413 km in 2006 to 8,415 kilometers of fiber, serving 3,400 destinations in 149 counties and in 23 mainland provinces. Because of the policies adopted, the mobile phone service has been stimulated to develop, with the result that there is now a greater penetration to 100%. They have laid the foundation of the path that will lead us to the knowledge society.

"In renewable energy, the government has developed laws and programs that are ready to be applied, but greater awareness of citizenship is required, it is necessary to encourage the population to accompany the process, encourage the installation of hybrid solar and gas systems in the houses, similar to the program of energy saving light bulbs ... " . Jorge Burbano, Building Workshop Program Government Ecologists.

LINES OF ACTION

• Expanding the horizon of oil reserves to meet growing domestic and global energy demand; and above all to finance and support the change in production, essential and urgent structural change to be undertaken in the shortest possible time matrix.

• Continue the transformation of the energy matrix based on a scenario of substitution and efficiency. We must maximize the use of hydro-energy potential in relation to non-renewable energy sources. With projects that are under construction, by 2016 90% of hydropower in the energy matrix will be exceeded. New studies and projects (hydro, geothermal, wind and biomass) to be after the current projects come into operation implemented should be undertaken, given that demand is growing.

• Promote energy sovereignty. Moving from importers to exporters of electricity, thanks to the large hydroelectric projects under construction; including the work of the largest hydroelectric engineering history of the country: the Coca-Codo-Sinclair (1,500 MW) project; Blower (487 MW); Delsitanisagua (115 MW); Mazar-Dudas (21 MW); Quijos (50 MW); Minas-San Francisco (275 MW); Toachi - Pilatón (253 MW); Manduriacu (62 MW), and Villonaco (16.5 MW) wind project.

• Deepen the incorporation of clean and efficient technologies in the field of freight and people, introducing innovations that have occurred in the automotive sector in the world, related to the development of hybrid and electric engines. Programs to promote public transport over private transport of people and logistics systems to optimize the use of cargo transport, will be implemented.

• Boosting energy efficiency programs in the industrial and residential sectors. We propose to strengthen programs for conversion to technologies that allow significant energy savings in industrial processes and use of household appliances. Incentives for energy savings, by fixing prices differentiated by consumption and the implementation of public awareness programs on energy saving deepen.

• Change the concept of energy sovereignty and natural resources in a mere tax conception to exercise our rights on material flows, in order to generate added value. For example, using our oil to produce gasoline or plastics (with the petrochemical), use our mines to produce cables or chips (with copper, metals and rare earths).

• Harnessing mineral resources with socio-environmental responsibility, encouraging the exploitation and development of large-scale mining projects, to ensure state participation in the profits of mining and generate reasonable returns for investment in geological, technical and risk commercial.

• Further actions to finally eradicate illegal mining in order to protect natural resources that are the property of all Ecuadorians, and guarantee the rights of people and nature. Advance royalties invest in areas where mining projects are executed to achieve sustainable development.

Proposal 5. The solidarity economy is the wealth of the people!
Posted on November 23, 2012 by pgpais


Deepening the social economy, promote various forms of Community production, associative and cooperative

We advanced our economic transformation process with structural policies distribution and redistribution of the means of production, knowledge, culture and wealth. Let's democratize the social acquis to ensure favorable results in the short term, and contribute to change in the long term. It is a deliberate and planned process, which is aimed at reorganizing production based on commonality of interests between the state, social and economic sectors, co-operatives, associations, communities, public company, private company, enterprise economy popular and solidarity, (large, medium and small) joint venture - as part of a long-term project, generating broad based national productive sectors and entrepreneurs committed to the country's development.

The social economy seeks to build relations of production, exchange, cooperation and reciprocity that promote equity, efficiency and quality, and are supported by solidarity. In this sense, systemic productivity and competitiveness should be measured as the progress of the community and not as the sum-many times arbitrarily of individuals.

"To achieve yields economies of scale joint between Solidarity Economy organizations both in the production and distribution is necessary. For this we must encourage and facilitate the associative and community projects, strengthening and networking in the production chain ... " . Flavio Sisalima Hermida, Building Workshop Government Program, Morona Santiago.

Advancing security and food sovereignty, land redistribution and sustainable agricultural productivity, especially in small and medium-sized agricultural units

For the revolutionaries of the XXI century is so important redistribution of the means of production-land, water, credit, technology and information-such as a profound change in terms of productivity and the participation of small producers in the value chain.

The use and optimal use of the means of production, technical assistance, seed improvement, technological innovation, applied research and social practices which directly favors the producers-way will allow us to achieve an improvement in yields production.

a renewal is required in the design of change in agriculture where a different logic of previous reforms, which gave farmers more land pobressin affect water control and productivity we address the distribucióncon. "We only gave ground and sky", as would Amadeo Alba in the 60s, to qualify an agrarian reform that did not alter the conditions of production. We require a transformation that affects all factors asfixianla peasant family economy and prevent its incorporation with lead levels of efficiency and competitiveness in production markets.

The enactment of a set of laws that affect land, water and other means of production is substantial for our proposal.

Food security ─como a search for self-sufficiency at national level, involving also fair terms of trade between rural and urban ─ achieve favor producers, but also consumers who will have access to a diet more adecuadapagando prices not reward speculation. The agricultural economy requires transformation and dynamism. Funding and mechanisms should primarily benefit small and medium farmers. All this vision is part of what we mean by agrarian revolution that means building at national and regional food sovereignty policies that break the laws of a globalized market and especulativoque subjected to Southern countries to a production model adjusted to the requirements Northern countries.

Strengthen the partnership is needed to transform production and achieve Good Living rural condition. We want to generate productive capacities to benefit from the partnership for the purposes of increasing production levels, access to capital and intervention in the market value chain. We will promote agricultural marketing system to reduce the volatility of commodity prices and profit margins of intermediaries. So we achieve increase producer incomes and reduce food prices for citizens.

Let's change the correlation of forces in favor of small producers. The policy should be aimed at improving distribution channels and absorption of commodities for food industry. This change in the correlation of forces is part of the process we drive to reverse mode hub accumulation of wealth.

"Lack support small producers, monopolies have stopped the productivity of small farmers by the concentration of land and water, access to resources and markets is limited. State investment is needed to industrialize primary products in the same territory by creating supportive agricultural enterprises and create national food marketing system, eliminating the chain of intermediaries. " Basantes Zoila Hernandez, Association of Women-Chimborazo Colta.

LINES OF ACTION

• To promote the dynamism of agricultural, livestock and marine for further progress in strengthening food security sector. Established incentives and funding priorities are oriented towards achieving an economy of agriculture with higher productivity, higher levels of protection of ecosystem integrity in the long term, diversification of products, and equity in the distribution benefits.

• Promote access to markets for small and medium agricultural and livestock producers, incorporating value added production, shortening the chain of intermediaries, facilitating access to capital to participate in the market, and promoting state intervention as reguladordel system agricultural marketing. The system will allow the strengthening of producers in quality standards, health records, mechanisms of traceability and designation of origin, among others.

• Strengthen innovation in production processes that foster technology transfer and capacity to smallholders. Transform concepts and practices paraconvertirlos technical assistance in daily contact between the producer and the technician technological field and adjust to the realities and conditions of peasant production responses.

• Continue to work in the agricultural insurance to guarantee it universal coverage to small and medium producers as a protection mechanism against losses caused by the impact of adverse weather conditions.

• policies to promote clean farming, involving the gradual transition from traditional forms of production, with fertilizers that affect the land and waters of irrigation-Apply to organic production. Encourage the development of agro-ecology and agriculture based on ecological, social, cultural and production principles; and promote the recognition of knowledge and skills of farmers. These considerations lead to higher crop resistance to harsh conditions such as drought and soil impoverishment. As a fringe benefit agroecology creates jobs.

• Encourage networking baskets solidarity between groups of producers and local consumers, and generate direct mechanisms enabling farmers productive projects meet the requirements of the programs and institutions of the public sector.

• Create associative marketing infrastructure and state levels to prevent speculation with seasonal farm production.

• Develop actions to achieve self-sufficiency in products that are currently imported and also in generating new products for the domestic and foreign markets as afforestation and mariculture.

Proposal 7. The economy at the service of the people!
Posted on November 27, 2012 by pgpais


Orient trade policy to economic and social development of Ecuador

The Ecuador promotes new modes of production, consumption, trade, organizing life and live, putting the economy at the service of man.

The design and implementation of policies seeking new markets, trading tools and trading arrangements should seek to develop national industries, so as to generate positive externalities and promote productive chains to increase productivity and prevent systemic threat to our sensitive areas .

We will support with priority to those industries that will diversify the exportable supply and result in a basket of products with higher added value. Through a strategy of diversifying our export products, concatenated to the transformation of the productive matrix and the correction of situations of market concentration, we contribute to strengthening industry in our country and create opportunities for the commercial integration of producers and exporters, no only for micro, small and medium enterprises and actors of popular and solidarity economy, but also for large companies.

Under this vision, Ecuador rejects reductionist models such as free trade agreements (FTAs) that promote the interests of transnational and domestic power groups. We encourage trade agreements for Development (ACD). This new instrument is set up as a necessary alternative, as it protects us from the harmful effects based on power asymmetries exchange, by introducing clauses and the preservation of productive sensitivities, cooperation in trade and safeguard development .

Consistent with the efforts made for the sake of a robust regional integration, Latin American neighbors are now our priority productive partners, resulting in strengthening the economic fabric, communications and trade in the region. We require a regional integration based on our strengths and the complementary exchange with our neighboring countries.

"Lack support small producers, monopolies have stopped the productivity of small farmers by the concentration of land and water, access to resources and markets is limited, the state investment is needed to industrialize in the same commodity territory by creating solidarity and create national food marketing system, eliminating the chain of intermediaries) "agricultural enterprises .

LINES OF ACTION

• Advance in the design of a sovereign and coordinated economic, social and cultural national trade policy process, and to the aim of changing the internal production model, to consolidate existing foreign markets and redirect foreign trade to countries in which Ecuadorian products can be inserted strategically.

• Strengthen regional integration as a tool to find markets that are consistent with the technological level of our production system and inserting domestic production into regional production chains. Business intelligence capabilities and market should be strengthened to meet international trends, in order to feed the productive and technological policies to exploit opportunities in various markets worldwide.

• To promote South-South trade prioritizing the region. The geographical and cultural proximity reduce transaction costs, which facilitates and optimizes the trade. Strengthening regional markets reduces the risks of systemic crisis.

• Promote a strategy to attract foreign productive investment to knowledge transfer, disaggregation and technological innovation, in line with national objectives and internal legislation, under the logic of a fair return, taxes, and non-outsourcing environmental cost.

• Forming joint ventures grannacionales public and supranational coordinating public demand. Carry out productive projects and initiatives in strategic sectors at regional level.

• Continue to promote the establishment of dispute settlement mechanisms in South multilateral agencies, which the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) of the World Bank (WB) Differences.

Promoting research, dialogue of knowledge and innovation to achieve the knowledge society and productive change

Ecuador, like many Southern countries, is experiencing a new form of dependency tied to knowledge. Every day that Microsoft decides to launch a new version of Microsoft Office, the global South has no choice but to buy their licenses or "piratearlas". The world has moved from industrial capitalism to cognitive capitalism.

The main recipe to enter the new capitalism was privatized formula bet on Research & Development & Innovation (R + D + I) and the commercialization of higher education, science and technology. Within this strategy successful industrial countries imposed rules early development of private game with the other countries of the globe, where the management of intellectual property and the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) have been his main instrument of domination.

A country with a late capitalism and an open economy with the world since the nineteenth century, can never base a strategy of knowledge management in a type of science, technology and innovation closed or privatized. This would lead to total failure. This is why management of "common knowledge and open" to the public space in which to move freely is proposed. The management model includes generating creative ideas, their use, the potential production of goods and services and the distribution of its benefits. The management of knowledge as a public-seen, and open- common good, not only expresses a principle or ethical activity according to the Constitution, but from the economic point of view is more efficient than closed models.

Given this specific situation it is necessary to take a position on the direction of research. A country with low productivity and still have unmet basic needs, you can not afford to investigate investigated. The research must have an ethical and social background: applied research should be based on the needs of the country.

The decision that is applied research has economic backdrop: seeks to build social and solidarity economy. The Citizen Revolution proposes locate in the center of the social and solidarity, to generate, access, production and distribution of information and knowledge, as a new strategy of accumulation and redistribution economy. Building a supportive social and economic system will be feasible only if it has processes of social transfer of research results to macro and meso scale.

It is a system of knowledge management that produces social solidarity economy, to the extent that it is an investigation where social gain is greater than the private, because distributes the benefits of that knowledge in an open, free or subsidized . Also it encourages the construction of projects or effective and efficient social and collective innovations to tackle problems that under other circumstances would not be affected by private economic circuits.

The task of investigating in a social economy seeks to produce social innovation. Knowledge management in Ecuador should be oriented to building new practices and forms of organization, in ways that help to produce goods and services to solve problems of the country or region. Social innovation has to address those social aspirations and enhance comparative advantages that we have in advance to radicalize building a quality democracy.

From systems of cognitive capitalism, based on the formula I + D + I, the system proposed by the Ecuador lies in a cooperative and open learning where research builds social economy and allow innovation to emancipate social order to achieve living and living well.

Finally, in the field of culture, education and knowledge we find that multiculturalism plays a key role in this challenge for equality. The "scientific" knowledge and the various knowledge (a category that includes different knowledge and skills) are valid to the extent that they are part of the collective experience, patterns made from the communities and give answers to social, economic, environmental, consumption, etc. of societies. Thus, the various knowledge related to knowledge management peoples, nations and communities, as well as knowledge resulting from the positivist method, have limitations that can be corrected from an open dialogue on equal conditions under complementary mechanisms aimed at avoid any form of subordination of knowledge or know about another.

"It is essential to develop a knowledge-intensive industry scientist doing research and development of the core of our production. To do this we must strengthen the link between universities and communities to develop projects to turn generate employment and improve incomes . " Carmen Mancheno, Building Workshop Government Program, Azuay.

 LINES OF ACTION

• Moving forward with the revolution of the educational and scientific system. The social emancipation involves the revolution of ideas. The main investment to produce a qualitative leap in Ecuadorian society is in the skills and talents of its citizens. Joint cooperation of millions of brains (collective intelligence) and produce resources and democratic collective use available to all citizens, knowledge-based scanning, in the democratization of information and open technologies and material access all over the country. To this end, we encourage the development of local industry information and communications technology (ICT) by use of free software, which can become a major driver of innovation in the country. We believe that public content created or financed by the state, gradually have to go to the public domain and be published in Creative Commons licenses.

• Reducing the knowledge divide as a mechanism using digital literacy. Digital road (fiber optics, broadband, wireless, etc.) are the new ways to produce a radical cognitive transformation. To do this, we will extend the fiber optic infrastructure throughout the country, increase the number of broadband users, the household access to Internet at low cost be promoted, it will continue installing community information centers; DTT is a reality and continue to strengthen e-government.

• To promote a dialogue of knowledge that involves rethinking institutions to reinvent the relationship between different skills, knowledge and cultural expressions. The epistemological, political and administrative dimensions are the starting point for the dialogue of knowledge a strategic resource for sustainable human development. It is above all a political proposal that leads to democratize the processes of interaction of knowledge, promoting the creation of a culture of civic diversity, and a quantum leap to the recognition, promotion and protection of alternative knowledge to knowledge scientific.

9. Proposed University of excellence to expand opportunities!
Posted on November 29, 2012 by pgpais


Further democratization and quality of the university system to the full development of social skills and job opportunities

In the first period of the Citizen Revolution the broad outlines of a system of excellence in higher education were outlined. In them the principle that the construction of a "mass" criticism within society will be guaranteed only if they have a quality university is present. It is possible to increase access and coverage to college, but if it is of poor quality, their impact on democracy and society as a whole will be very limited or scarce.

The public policy of the government will seek to build a quality education system by providing incentives for institutions of higher education that seek excellence. The main mechanisms that the government will apply to consolidate a system that places universities in Ecuador in the group of the best universities in the world are: attract teachers of the highest academic level to teach classes in the country; invest in laboratories and scientific research projects; Accreditation reward excellence and provide scholarships to the teaching staff.

The Citizen Revolution insists that you can not generate different circuits in offering quality higher education. Equal quality for all. The process of evaluation and accreditation system of higher education should be at the center of this second period of the Citizen Revolution.

The government of the Citizen Revolution also proposes to move from an individual research, privatized, competitive and unconnected with the country's needs, a system of social innovation open, cooperative and articulate the requirements and potential of Ecuador and the region. The political project is fully aware that one of the main economic and democratic resources to which we put the greatest effort of collective action is the construction of an innovative and creative learning based on the "cooperation of brains." The implementation of the new university academic system is a priority in the construction of social innovation system.

Yachay or the City of Knowledge is one of the most important projects promoted by the government of the Citizen Revolution. It is a hub of knowledge-unifying and redistribuidor- seeking to establish collaborative and associative networks between international and national university system. This city univeritaria integrate the research of universities and non-university with public and private enterprises technical and technological institutes, by building scientific, technological and industrial parks. Yachay will comprise the State through public research institutes.

But we have to keep working only for quality. Higher education in Ecuador has been a reproductive system of social stratification. He only had access to a particular socio-economic elite. Education, understood as a social mobilizer and construction of a harmonious democracy be achieved if the country's most excluded are integrated as leading players in the circuit of knowledge, and not as mere recipients, consumers or workers. Undoubtedly, the quality of democracy, social cohesion and productive transformation is associated with the construction of a critical people in society.

Gratuity in higher education has been a first step of the Citizen Revolution. Democratize access to higher education should be part of the strategic agenda that brings us to fulfill the constitutional mandate. Increased access of individuals and social groups to college allows a radical change in the social structure.

Networks will promote learning, knowledge and innovation as part of the process of Latin American integration. We are convinced that social emancipation can not occur if there is no emancipation of thought. Therein lies the true individual freedom and national sovereignty.

Social revolution
Posted on December 3, 2012 by pgpais
Social policy paid the piper of neoliberalism. At this time of remembrance thankless they were shelved citizenship and concepts such as universality, efficient public service, responsibility, rights and guarantees. For those who ruled at that time, the citizen became a subject and manipulable prey to demagoguery clienteles. Remember the terrible event of a former senior official of the Ministry of Social Welfare, during the government of Lucio Gutierrez, shooting at defenseless citizens from a building where they were to build public social policies of the country. It was the misery of the theory and the reign of the "povertology" with which international credit organizations profited.

The separation of social policy of economic and production was one of the privileged strategies. Austerity and suffocating foreign debt commitments reduced social spending to its lowest levels. The neoliberal social policy is developed and implemented from a para-institutions: project execution units by the big banks funded cooperation.

Social policy was defined and adjusted in the formats of the "letters of intent" to the credit of macroeconomic stabilization and structural adjustment. State attention focused on privatization, liberalization and deregulation, never in a social policy focused on rights.

In the government of the Citizen Revolution to break with that vision it is clear and radical. We opt for a universal social policy perspective, but to recognize all diversities and has rights approach. Our Constitution gave up on vulnerable subjects and conceived the men and women of the country, as citizens with equal rights.

We broke with the concept of development and progress and economic growth and build the regime of Good Living. Our government has not established a new social policy, has made a social revolution and its results are obvious.

Proposal 11. The rights are not favors!
Posted on December 3, 2012 by pgpais
PHOTOS-PLAN-11

Radicalise the regime of Good Living with universal health, education, social inclusion and safety

The rights are not favors, as expressed in the Constitution. The bases of the regime of Good Living are based on four pillars: the commodification of welfare; the universality of social rights; the recovery of the link between the social and economic; and social, family and personal responsibility on welfare.

Placing at the center the commodification and globalization, we believe the welfare and rights guaranteed multiple dimensions as the provision of public goods and services, access to which is not dependent on a specific employment status or a "label" of poverty. Health, education, social inclusion and safety have to aim to be universal and quality for all.

The responsibility for the welfare represents a fundamental change in the way the population is linked to the implementation of the policy, in the exercise of their rights and their own abilities. Stewardship also means fairness in the distribution of work being generated, between men and women, between the money economy and the care economy.

Social inclusion policies include: the contributory and non-contributory universal insurance; and ensuring access to a basic set of rights to meet needs and build capacity. These two elements, together with access to health and education are at the heart of social inclusion, which is the basic level guaranteed by the State.

While thus ensure basic coverage of fundamental rights, the main change in the political capacity, social inclusion and security lies in empowerment and social mobility as part of a process that allows a qualitative change. So that social mobility involves the maturation process out of poverty, the empowerment of people, training and promotion, and linking mechanisms and spaces in which the effective participation in economic, social areas is exercised, political and cultural.

"They must be centers for priority sectors to be integral in its construction, functionality, monitoring and inclusion in the community" . Marita Ramon, construction workshop Prgrm Government, Zamora.

 LINES OF ACTION

• To consolidate the National System of normative social inclusion and equity enshrined in the Constitution, to guarantee the rights and objectives of Good Living regime. A new social security law and a code of comprehensive protection in the whole life cycle will be key.

• Ensure access to and quality of education, retention, mobility and graduation without discrimination on the initial, basic and high school level.

• Consolidate the system of compensatory education for youth and adult literacy programs with sustained, accelerated primary, secondary blended training methods adapted to the needs of participants and to enable their access to vocational training.

• Achieve universal coverage of the population from the articulation between politics and security programs contributory and non-contributory. It is essential to articulate the traditional system of social security, non-contributory benefits are recognized for members of households receiving the Human Development Bond, as well as for seniors without coverage and for persons with disabilities who are not protected by any mechanism.

• Designing the CCT, as the Human Development Bond, as part of a package of social inclusion that protects households in poverty and unmet basic needs. In this transfer they have already been joined by a host of other features that allow this instrument away from its initial conception and classical welfare.

• Reorient conditionality BDH to the current situation of Ecuador. Given the almost universal conditions of access to primary education is a priority for the state to seek a family responsibility oriented adequate nutrition, comprehensive child development, terminal efficiency in secondary education and health care of the adult population higher.

• Structuring a National Care Subsystem to protect priority groups throughout their life cycle, particularly to ensure child development and is responsible for making a decent living for the elderly.

• Increase the coverage of social security, whether by way of formal labor relations or the responsibility of their spouse as guarantors of the welfare of family members.

The integrated child development is a key element of any social project, cultural, economic or productive you want to build.

The irresponsibility of the previous government allowed the attention to this population group entered deteriorating. Under the logic of "auction" demand subsidy and facile and social exploitation, care programs for children less than 5 years collapsed, their quality was deplorable and null or negative impacts. 

Serve, nurture and strengthen this stage of life should be a state policy. This was proposed by the Citizen Revolution.

A quality health and warmth to enable an integral development of each and every Ecuadorian

The health and disease processes have tended to prioritize the curative actions over preventive, and have focused more on the individual than on its surroundings. The Citizen Revolution works to intervene, with a wide and decisive manner on all the factors that are determining their health, to ensure the constitutional rights of Good Living. The human being can not be understood in isolation from their environment, their history, their time, their feelings and their knowledge; therefore we propose that the concept and practice of health policies strengthened.

"Health is a right guaranteed by the State, whose realization is linked to the exercise of other rights, including the right to water, food, education, physical culture, work, social security, healthy environments and others that they support the Good Life. The State guarantees this right through economic, social, cultural, educational and environmental policies; and the permanent, timely and without exclusion programs, actions and promotion services and comprehensive health, sexual health and reproductive health services. The provision of health services shall be governed by the principles of equity, universality, solidarity, multiculturalism, quality, efficiency, effectiveness, precaution and bioethics, with a gender and generational.

Thus, the provision of services will be more accessible and equitable. Strengthen the referral system between public network institutions (Ministry of Health, the Ecuadorian Institute of Social Security, Armed Forces, Police) and the private network, ensuring access and optimizing the use of all available resources in the country. We delve into the provision of pre-hospital care, linking all public and private ambulances to 911 Integrated Security System (SIS-ECU 911).

• Strengthening decentralized processes in the territory and intersectoral coordination. A mandatory condition for a model based on primary care work is the commitment of all stakeholders.

Proposal 14. Towards the end of poverty!
Posted on December 7, 2012 by pgpais
PHOTOS-PLAN-14

Achieving social equality through capacity building for which social investment, the tax liability and work are fundamental

Eradicating poverty remains the ethical imperative of countries like ours. The government of the Citizen Revolution is not proposed "combat" poverty in neoliberal key, as proposed in the past. Main Elobjetivo is to banish extreme poverty, reduce existing poverty levels, as we have been doing, and to increase and enhance the capabilities and levels of welfare of the whole society.

Our conceptual and operational leaders in this field are not based on targeting, welfarism, clientelism or paternalism; on the contrary, we face the problem from the inclusion, equity, closing gaps, social mobility and equality.

In the neoliberal era they were not lacking countries and experiences where "fighting" poverty meant to deny, hide or delete. In our case, we seek social mobility of the population and in this context equality becomes our fundamental normative reference.

The Human Development Bond operated over the years as a mechanism that contributes to the generation of social capacities as a possibility of financial and economic (Human Development Credit) inclusion; ie under a different concept of who had the neoliberal governments: a bonus of poverty that serve for the removal of the gas subsidy.

The eradication of poverty is not possible without a sound fiscal pact that allows the distribution and redistribution of wealth. A fiscal pact to make effective the constitutional principles of generality, progressivity, efficiency, non-retroactivity, equity, transparency and revenue adequacy. The sustainability of this effort will only be possible as long as the new non-poor are economically integrated into a society of owners and producers.

LINES OF ACTION

• Run a National Strategy for Equality and Social Mobility, seeking to close social gaps in the traditionally excluded populations and causing social mobility of poor households in the country and its members. Give priority territories and households in poverty, we will articulate the universal policy packages specific actions and public policies that recognize the different socio-economic and cultural realities. We optimize public interventions aimed at poor households and generate intersectoral in the territories. We need to create innovative ways to own and measurement, which not only realize how out of poverty but how we are achieving Good Living.

• Increase the amount of Human Development Bond (US $ 50) by a mechanism that for the first time in history, not socialize the losses of elites but their profits. Revolutionary and unprecedented way, this will increase the profits of the haves (the bank). The redistributive effects of this measure clearly reveal the political priorities of the Citizen Revolution.

• Consolidate a solid fiscal pact, a tax culture and tax citizenship. The aspiration of fiscal policy will get citizenship tribute conceived as a desirable contribution necessary for building a just and cohesive country. To do so, we will advance in tax citizenship training and specialization of civil servants.

• Fight against tax evasion and fraud. Combat evasion constitute the backbone of fiscal policy. The prioritization of direct taxation and convergence towards levels of tax burden of the wealthiest nations will be essential. Under the slogan "serve serving monitoring and control" advance tax administration in controlling full compliance with tax obligations and develop strategies to prosecute and punish fraud, tax evasion and money laundering.

Proposal 15. Work and living wage!

PHOTOS-PLAN-15

Ensure proper working conditions and income to the welfare of workers and the full enjoyment of life

Public policies to promote decent work should be an engine of Good Living arrangements should enable to get a greater number of jobs and the best possible conditions. In Ecuador the work is recognized as a right and a social duty, and as such, requires state protection to ensure that this is worthy, decent and fair wages, to meet the needs of the individual and his family.

Despite the legal requirement, the right to work in the country does not translate into a universal ability to access it, or decent employment directly or with fair wages. The government of the Citizen Revolution has made significant progress in this direction, but there is an important path to walk. While the formal sector of the labor market in the country enjoys the most rights under the Constitution a sector in expansion since 2007, another sector still important, which is characterized by precarious job offer: low productivity, lack of wages fair, lack of legal and tax regulations, and affiliation to social security.

It is necessary to continue working in a harmonious policy that allows view and deal with temporal and structural imbalances in the economy and integrate the different elements that affect the condition of work and quality. The basics of the work should be linked with the person, their rights and duties; and also with the duties and rights of the employer. The State must ensure the existence of decent and fair employment and work, to enable a sustainable horizon of the relationship for both parties and that translates into greater prosperity for the population as a whole.

The Citizen Revolution involves state action to achieve equal rights, responsibilities and opportunities, proposing affirmative action for rights holders who are in unequal situation.

Thereby we seek to replace the racist, white-mestizo, male and adult country, a country of all and all, where differences and diversity are the foundation of what intercultural and plurinational.

Revolution of justice, security and coexistence
Posted on December 12, 2012 by pgpais
Ecuador is a country of peace and coexistence. We did not have the social violence that has plagued other Latin American brothers. Peace is our most precious asset. The Constitution of Montecristi set as primary duty of the state to guarantee its citizens the right to a culture of peace, integral security and to live in a democratic society free of corruption (Article 3, paragraph 8). We must ensure safety and coexistence in our cities and rural areas.

The various violence that threaten the physical and psychological integrity of any person must be active and hard-fought. We referimosa crime and organized crime still suffer, though less so than in the recent past. But we also refer to domestic and gender violence even cause fear in the private sector of some women and children, and the elderly; equally to traffic accidents and industrial accidents, among others.

A community with a rich, active and supportive social fabric, build meeting places, coexistence, respect and mutual recognition is not only habitable but also safer community. So we focus on strengthening civil society, popular self-organization and the construction of public space as a place for meeting and socializing. But there are sources of violence and insecurity that must be fought with the force of law. The various instances of the criminal justice system-the police, the judiciary and the Penitentiary system are the tools with which we citizenship in a democratic state to face criminal phenomena, and criminal acts that are committed in our country. We will continue working to consolidate professional bodies of efficient and effective service to the public safety. We want a staff committed to human rights, the Constitution and democracy.

These are tough times for crime. We have significantly increased investment in the national police in their equipment and infrastructure; we have created an integrated security ECU 911 service, we have articulated all public institutions related to security. We have hardened our action on crime and organized crime, and we have given greater consistency the penal system.

It is our will to work to achieve a system of politicized decommodified and justice, to realize the cherished right to justice, so we can safely say that all citizens, women and men are equal before the law. We continue to strengthen the rule of rights and democracy, as well as an efficient and modern system, following the popular mandate of the Consultation, 2011.

Proposal 17. Justice for All! No more impunity!
Posted on December 12, 2012 by pgpais
PHOTOS-PLAN-17Deepening the transformation of justice, serving the popular mandate to strengthen the rule of rights and equality before the law

The structure of the administration of justice in the country was historically weak. This caused the interference of political parties, economic actors and other branches of government, while limiting its institutional development. This structural weakness had an impact on various aspects of the administration of justice: 1) lack of material resources: technology and infrastructure; 2) lack of organization, operational management and non-standardized internal procedures; 3) poor legal framework, which favored the writing system and difficult change management model.

The reality of the justice system violated the guarantee of due process. The legal framework used for decision-making was insufficient; the analysis of the evidence in the trials was not met in all cases, the interpretation of the rules was limited or literal without proper analysis. Existing weaknesses were reflected in the quality of justice services and the right of the affected population effective access to justice: cumbersome, slow and transparent procedures caused a large backlog of cases and the general distrust in the system.

Faced with these weaknesses, the 2008 Constitution marks a paradigmatic rupture to be the protection of rights as the basis for justice: a constitutional State of rights and justice is set. Members of the judiciary who are public service of citizenship and human rights as fundamental to the administration of justice servers. In accordance with the Constitution, ships the Organic Code of the Judiciary, which reflects, among other things, the definition of new functions and mechanisms to transform justice.

Despite this constitutional and legal framework, the crisis of the justice system was still in force. For this reason the Executive called on citizens to the referendum held on May 7, 2011. This consultation was a major step in terms of public ownership to break with the old system of administration of justice.

After these first years of the Revolution Citizen today the necessary conditions exist to provide better service to citizens, with planned infrastructure at national level, taking into account technical parameters and no patronage. Today judicial services in procedural matters benefit to citizens. However, it is essential to take into account that there are still barriers to be completed in order that Ecuador has the justice that is required.

Eradicate violence against women, against children and adolescents, and to combat all forms of discrimination and violence. Indifference is complicity

Ecuador is the second Latin American country after Mexico, which has led to corporal on the part of the state, a national survey on violence against women. It is very important to act through the development of laws and policies to eradicate the problem intolerable step. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC), 2012, 60% of the country's women reported having been the victim of some form of domestic violence at some point in their life. Also relevant is the fact that ensures that one in four women have experienced sexual violence. This situation can no longer be hidden behind the walls of homes, and in the secrecy of the relationships and / or family.

The eradication of gender-based violence requires the adoption of laws and the adoption of policies to reverse the situation, and an important work of awareness. This violence has structural causes in patriarchal societies shaping our own. You can not end with them without a real cultural change brought about by changes in the social, political and family structures. While we got these transformations, it should take immediate steps to eradicate this problem and contribute to the welfare and guarantee of freedom of many women measures, as well as minors and elderly.

The Constitution is very clear in this area. Article 66, paragraph 3, notes that recognizes and guarantees to the people: the right to humane treatment, including: a) The physical, mental, moral and sexual integrity; b) A life free of violence in the public and private sectors. The State shall take steps to prevent, suppress and punish all forms of violence everyone at a disadvantage or vulnerability measures, especially against women, children, adolescents, older people, transsexuals and people with disabilities. Identical measures will be taken against violence, slavery and sexual exploitation.

LINES OF ACTION

• Deepen specific prevention plans trafficking and sexist attacks. Gender violence is produced and reproduced within a patriarchal cultural structures. As a first step to address this structural violence which can be physically and / or sicológica- should carry out major awareness programs, aimed at different audiences: general population, youth and adolescents, women victims of abuse, children , the elderly, etc. It is necessary to empower women to exercise their rights, as a couple, as a mother, as a partner, as head of the household, but also work to define masculinity spaces and shared responsibilities in the home life and work, without this mean a loss of identity.

• Foster a culture that promotes egalitarian relationships and reject violence against women in the mass media (movies, soap operas, video games, etc). Question 9 of the referendum of 2011 set the appointment of a council regulation that regulates programming media regarding the broadcasting of violent content, sexually explicit and discriminatory.

• Create in the police special units to assist victims of domestic violence. Who has been a victim of sexual assault or violence in couples or families, it requires specialized and sensitive issues from the security host.

The public space is a good setting for community and mutual support networks weaving. A living city is always a more habitable and safe city. Generating places of sociability and coexistence in neighborhoods and towns is a major initiative to move towards good living.

A holistic view of public space must necessarily include natural protection areas and urban green areas, which are essential to ensure the sustainability of cities.

Cultural revolution
Posted on December 18, 2012 by pgpais
There is no social transformation without cultural revolution. Due to the change in power relations that has driven the Citizen Revolution, the current time is a privileged moment of cultural production, as with the reestablishment of the constitutional state of rights, mutual understanding processes that feed the formation of collective identities are stimulated higher.

It criticizes society narratives that legitimize exclusion to create languages ​​and recognizes in its report the experiences of emancipation led to his political existence. In Ecuador contemporary experience is formulated as a cultural dynamics of intercultural solidarity.

In this profound transformation of society must work together and the state to combat exclusion mechanisms installed by the oligarchy and deepened during the neoliberal period.

The exclusion of a large segment of the population of what was defined as elitist form of high culture, the arts and the creative space and cultural innovation was one of the results of the policies of the oligarchy in the cultural field, which moved the great majority of citizens and cultural production. The impact of this dynamic resulted in the construction of stereotypes about classes, women and ethnic groups as subjects of lower category, as determined by their customs, their jobs, their town, their myths and their "natural" tendencies, and therefore, unable to dialogue with others, to create political community or innovate culturally.

broad sectors of access to education in cultural resources and universal artistic languages ​​were excluded, to devalue and stratify worldviews and memory of the people, which allowed a single sector of society had monopoly control of content and public and media space, to accommodate their own expressions and private economic interests. This exclusion prevented long broad and diverse sectors that intervene in the creation and cultural consumption. Thus they were severely affected their citizenship rights.

One of the main strategies of neoliberal governments was the deregulation of the media field and its consequent abandonment to the determinism of the market and the interests of economic power groups to which they belonged. As a result we had a country that was not considered capable of producing cultural meaning that consumers had become colonized and dependent, with little or no capacity to produce their own culture and even less to export. The country entered a logical dependency of foreign products and renounced sovereignty in the media space.

Heritage policies were policies around the preservation of objects and did not refer even strengthened the link with the society that produced and its historical memory. The Citizen Revolution promotes and values ​​the creations, and cultural identities forged in the antagonism and resistance.

The recovery of the sense of the public, in all fields, marked from the beginning the agenda of the Citizen Revolution and with it, the new Constitution.

The cultural revolution has deepened the claim of respect for diversity, but has also taken a step further towards the goal of creating conditions for the exchange to occur between different equity and the deepest sympathy. The result of the revolution is the creation of a collective will, is a popular political reappropriation of their creative abilities, critical and forged in the heat exchange and the political imagination of the common good.

Since the 2008 Constitution culture no longer defined as a problem about how to manage objects, but as a matter of fundamental rights of all citizens. Unlike the Constitution, 1998, which stated in its Articles 62 and 63, that artists and intellectuals were the only cultural actors of the country's current Constitution states that all citizens are subject to Ecuadorian Cultural Rights (Article 21 and 22) . These are the rights to free expression, the fruitful encounter between diverse social memory and cultural heritage.

In the field of culture and cultural industries, this meant the establishment of public institutions for the management of cultural policy, the implementation of policies to encourage domestic production by creating the National System of Insolvency Fund and the National System Festivals such as mechanisms of democratic access to state resources by the creative community. It went from the custom of "lever pressing" transparency in access and use of public money for the creation and regulation of the media space, accompanied by the creation of public media was achieved.

The challenge in the coming years is the distribution and circulation of social content and autonomy built from memory, and the possibility of deepening social dialogue and interpret. It is guiding all the institutional network to the objectives of the democratization of cultural resources, access to public resources, delacceso safeguard equitable public space, and setting conditions for a vital cultural production in diversity, equity and solidarity, but above all with guaranteed circulation and distribution of content.

Ensuring the vitality and knowledge of the different identities, the expansion of public space for intercultural encounter and equality in difference. Promote social reappropriation of cultural memory to enhance the critical heritage, identity and cultural innovation

To govern is to ensure the cultural rights of the diverse country in the public space, the construction of memory of different identities, and also ensure conditions for citizens to become involved in the creation and the economy of culture.

People have a right to access and participate in the public space as a field of deliberation, cultural exchange, social cohesion and promoting equality in diversity.

Changing concept of cultural heritage is also one of the great accomplishments of the Citizen Revolution. The heritage is no longer a world of objects to become a system for the recovery of social memory. This turn us away from a practice that previously allowed institutional or private ownership of heritage objects. This new vision has enabled the peoples and nationalities exercise their social memory within their intercultural practice.

Proposal 22. Freedom of expression: all voices, all spaces!
Posted on December 21, 2012 by pgpais
PHOTOS-PLAN-22

Democratize, diversify and regulate the media space and radio spectrum to ensure full freedom of expression

The right to communication was enshrined in the 2008 Constitution as a right of everyone, individually or collectively. However, the media in the country have traditionally belonged to the power groups; Information has become a profitable business. Few people dare to question what is described and interpreted by the mass media, to put into question the "reality" that everyone tries to impose as a truth. The figures that appear daily to the public, to give "their information and review" part of the same circle, and can not say anything to upset the owners of the media.

Serious contradiction: market players (private media) are responsible for ensuring the right of citizens to information. Like any trader, the private media seeking profit. The editorial lines and treatment to information, far from being objective, serve the interests of private capital. During remained neoliberalism it privatized the right to information, which remained tied to the interests of the market.

Freedom of expression is not exclusive attribute of media companies, nor is it restricted to the field of mass media. It is the people who exercise it through their own spaces of expression in their daily lives, at work, in their communities, in their conflicts, in fighting for their rights in democratic processes lived through history.

Freedom can not be such if it goes against the processes and movements of history; press freedom can not be a fallacious argument used to confuse and hide the community opposed to democratic changes powerful interests. Changes driven by the Citizen Revolution threaten the privileges of the usual suspects, who are opposed to the transformation of Ecuador, this peaceful building of a new power, focused on the democratic participation of Ecuadorians, within the legal framework of the Constitution.

These five years have been enormous social teaching about the media, the private media and freedom of expression. We have learned, collectively, to reveal what is behind a supposed neutral, objective and unprejudiced position by traditional media, to discover the true interests they pursue and defend.

The ongoing confrontation between powers, where not only the media-established and legitimate power has given way to a long apprenticeship where the only ones who do not recognize and assimilate social pedagogy is precisely the media. To their owners, the only reason being is freedom of thought-not press or of expression, seen as the inevitable basis of democracy. However, the experience of recent years has dismantled its conservative, backward and opposed the progress of broad sectors of society. His persistent struggle against the approval of the Communications Act, as mandated by the Constitution, was the opportunity to come to the fore conflicts generated by the defense of their private interests.   

Although not yet have the Communications Law, the discussion process has allowed the dissemination of basic concepts that were never discussed publicly: subsequent liability, censorship, right to reply, correction, rights of journalists, among others. This has allowed also know the meaning of "responsible journalism" to differentiate it from the practice of a "business communication".

The current presence of public media, generation and gestation of community media, and some private press that works under an ethical and responsible framework, was the counterpart of this controversial scenario. Add to that the distribution of radio frequencies to indigenous peoples and nationalities, which has expanded the space of communication adds.

With this background another media reality whose purpose is the democratization of communication is built. The ever closer public media presence leads to an extension of the field of communication, they appear different agendas, a diverse and inclusive programming, without neglecting stories of reality from other perspectives.

Also noteworthy new expressions at regional and global level as the case of Telesur, which is presented as a communications proposal from the South and from the region. This is important to counter the Allied international media power to the national power shares the view of communication as a business, and it is in opposition to the progressive governments.

We defend freedom of expression of all Ecuadorians, not just the power groups. We believe in building pluralistic media that express the different voices of citizenship, community, public and private media. We believe in the democratization of the radio spectrum. We promote the generation of a critical citizenry that can demand their right to information and communication and social control over the media.

LINES OF ACTION

Consolidate public communication media spaces as citizens, with an increasing social participation for defining editorial lines. This process is also applicable to achieve a joint communication with schools whose curricula have not included the analysis and thinking about what they should be and make the public media.
Extend between each and every community media to express the diverse voices of social organizations and organized groups. The appropriation of communication as a factor of local and cultural transformation, involves breaking the old approaches that "Western hegemony" imposed on us models of what we see, hear and read. Intercultural communication in various languages ​​will be promoted.
Promote the democratization of the radio spectrum as a means to diversify the voices and effectively guarantee the freedom of expression and the right to communication and information.
Approve and enforce the Communications Act to define the short term, the new rules on the matter, in order to democratize communication, stimulate new technologies and to include more sectors in shaping a new and different social system Communication. Control institutions and the same media (public, community and private) are responsible for press support this new approach.
Develop a critical education about the messages and content. It is vital that schools, colleges and universities generate subjects and tasks to learn to read the media. This forge beings capable of critical analysis, and the opening for a popular and participatory communication. 
Define public communication policies to improve freedom of remote commercial criteria and concepts expression. Make this democratic value and transformative tool of new generations to build a less prejudiced, vertical and conservative society.
Placed as a priority to communication on the regional agenda of organizations such as UNASUR, CELAC and ALBA, in order to develop common strategies and actions as alliances between regional media and news agencies.

Proposal 23. Production of the arts!

Ensure equal access to basic resources for the creation and circulation of cultural goods and promote the development of national cultural industries

Creativity is a fundamental mechanism of redistribution of rights and freedoms, expansion of imagination and intelligence, as well as the ability to transform reality by opening perceptions and collective interpretation.

It is in the field of cultural industries where today more than ever, individual and collective sense of life takes place: memory, beliefs, future plans, tastes, consumer habits, identities and everything that fits into what we call culture.

The momentum of the performing arts, such as dance and theater; the plastic arts such as sculpture and painting; literary arts, such as fiction, poetry and essays; visual arts, such as film and photography; and musical arts, are areas to promote and strengthen by a consistent and an intercultural approach based on an adequate legal framework, including the Law of Culture public policy.

The creation of the Ministry of Culture and the National System of Culture allowed the decorporativization of institutions managing public funds drove activities for certain sectors of the population. The democratization of these spaces promoting cultural awareness and transparent access to state resources allowed an increase in the supply of diverse artistic and cultural production. Thousands of artists from throughout the country have access to resources to develop their projects, festivals and international performances.

The Ecuadorian State joined the Ibero-American Cultural System with the creation of Ibermedia, Ibermuseos, Iberescena, where the contribution of national resources multiplied three to five times to our creators.

The results of the public policy of the government of the people's revolution in the field of cultural creation and production are visible but one that serves as a paradigmatic example: the growth of the national film production by 300% in the past six years, as result of the application of a public policy to promote, driven by a competent authority (the National Film Board) where several bodies and social actors from the ministries of industry and culture, to the representatives of producers, audiovisual technicians and actors.

The positive impact of this growth is visible not only in the proliferation of both productions in the local market as samples, and international festivals, but also on the horizon that opens to the consolidation of this field as an industrial activity, has the following features: generates added value, it promotes research and implementation of proprietary technology enhances creativity, promotes various jobs, strengthen our sovereignty, provides identity references, etc. To consolidate this growth in the audiovisual field and spread to the entire field of cultural industries, we have to face several challenges to overcome.

LINES OF ACTION

Promote, disseminate and expand markets for arts and cultural industries, strengthening and consolidating subsystems cultural undertakings, and creative arts.
And progressively increase proportionally the amount of aid granted in each of the areas of production and circulation of cultural goods.
Promote the circulation of local and regional content equal face of global entertainment industries.

The birth of this new country demand consistency between what is said and what is done. Consistent with those demands were stripped of everything and are now the moral reserve of this process. They have preserved, as guardians of fire, memory, hope and dignity. This new country is demanding, do not settle, it does not readily accept the results. It is a country that relies on men and women who have dignified. It is a sovereign country and aware of its historical destiny.

Forging citizenship living honesty, reject corruption and respects the common good

Our revolution Ethics challenges and questions the immorality of capitalism, their selfishness, their lack of solidarity and humanity. Our revolution Ethics proposes conditions in which politics has as its center the human beings, not the market or the capital. We believe in the revolutionary consciousness of the people is where we have to generate the ethical revolution. We want a growing awareness of the meaning of public people. A people who feel that the state belongs to him as a public good; a State not expel anyone who does not have preferences. A people that does not allow a State never captured or kidnapped by banks by private companies or subordinated to foreign interests. A vibrant and vigorous people, ready to take the ethical defense of the Fatherland. That's what we want and why we fight.

The Ethics Revolution is drawn into the consciousness of people. The country needs women and honest, generous men, to fight against greed, hoarding and excess. We propose a more caring, more equitable, more inclusive life. Women and men who are no longer colonize ever more capital by selfishness, by the outrageous ambitions of individualism market. Women and men who leave behind the past dispossession and postponed excluded thousands of people.

Practices reinforce accountability, social control and the fight against corruption in public and private institutions

Good Living requires remaking the relationship between public and private. It is primarily a project of cultural transformation. To achieve this it is essential to recover representative cultural values ​​of society, such as honesty, loyalty, responsibility, honesty, respect and dignity, which have been passed on through generations and besides expressing civic qualities, will travel on a path of equity , freedom and solidarity.

The Ethics Revolution implies radical front and fight against corruption in all its manifestations; transform the public service to transparency and efficiency in management; banish corruption practices and relationships between public officials and private actors; incorporate citizen participation in processes of social control; contribute to the strengthening of ethical and business and union liability based on transparency and the rule of law and fight against impunity every day.

The fight against corruption is a commitment of the Government of the Citizen Revolution acquired since the beginning of this process of transformation, which has been reflected by the Ethics Revolution as a crosscutting issue in the actions of this government. The phenomenon of corruption must be approached from the State with the participation of all public institutions and society as a whole. Corruption not only involves damage to the citizens, but risks that are at stake values, credit institutions and human ethics, social capital and the public good.

A cultural change of this nature must be anchored in society. Hence the need to create opportunities for citizen participation and social control centers become true construction of the new society, to bring about change of values, generating innovative proposals that strengthen democracy and help eradicate corruption at all levels.

• Articulate mechanisms of state control to the processes of participation, accountability and social control, to overcome a procedural approach to control and incorporate the results of the analysis of public policy, in order to expand the public space, improve bases of legitimacy and deepen democracy.

Political and constitutional revolution
Posted on December 30, 2012 by pgpais
The deepening political and constitutional revolution is the means and the essential condition for reaching the other revolutions that proposed this program. A major challenge presented to us in the constitutional process, which is still in force, is to build a new political agreement providing for the recovery, modernization and democratization of the state and its strong relationship with the company. This means, first, to continue the fight against the denationalization of the economy and the deregulation of markets and the other reforms linked to the rationalization of public administration, decentralization of government and the relationship between management Public and citizen participation. This is to consolidate the existence of efficient, modern and participatory public institutions.

Democratize the state involves increasing the capacity of public institutions, among others, its ability to generate public policies and to respond to popular demands-along with increased trade and public deliberation between them and all the social actors . The efficiency of the institutions increases the democratic legitimacy and is not opposed to participatory civil society activity. On the contrary, it depends largely on the proper society-state dialogue.

During these six years we have built Citizen Revolution institutions, recovering the stewardship capacity and state planning. We have substantively improved the quality of public services, and we have also opened various channels for citizen participation in shaping the public agenda and the social control of institutions.

In the next gubernatorial cycle we will continue to drive the radical transformation of the state, in all its functions and level of government, and the democratization of relations with society, to ensure the rights enshrined in the Constitution. This basically requires the construction of an active and able to sue the State to fulfill its citizenship rights, and to collaborate with him to the generation of a just, united and sovereign society. We know that the implementation of the draft constitution requires popular mobilization and constant updating of institutions in a permanent dialogue and tension with the constituent power. The Constitution is our horizon, an open terrain of political struggle.


26. We proposed build popular power!

Promote and recognize the social organization, community life and active citizenship in the defense and implementation of the Constitution.

Popular mobilization cornered neoliberalism and led the forces of the Citizen Revolution successive victories against the power of party, banking, of the oligarchy and the whole retrograde sectors of the country. The struggle for democracy and popular participation in the polls has allowed over the years advance confronted a force for change, permanently, to the great powers.

The advance of the Citizen Revolution depends on keeping alive the citizen mobilization, dynamic social organization, keeping alive the constituent power, which is the basis of popular sovereignty. The Constitution recognizes the people as the principal and first auditor of public power. Participation and social organization does not arise by spontaneous generation but is the result of a deliberate action to promote and strengthen the social fabric, community life, and the establishment of channels of contact between the State and Society.

There are two key areas for action to build and promote social power. First, the promotion of self-organization by consolidating social associations and civic organizations and building collaborative networks between them. These have to be seen not only as plaintiffs policy actors and resources to the state, but also as construction of own distinct institutions of state power. It is important to create an autonomous, plural and rich social fabric, with specific organizational, discursive, technical, and economic as indispensable for the democratization of the public sphere support.

Second, the implementation of the mechanisms and processes of social participation for discussion between public institutions and citizens. This is to strengthen opportunities for dialogue among government, social organizations and citizens for efficient and democratic process of popular demands. It is important to boosting mechanisms for dialogue with stakeholders with situations of particular vulnerability of their rights so that they can legitimately exercise various forms of deliberation, negotiation and pressure on the state.

In both dimensions of strengthening people's power plays a major role use and social appropriation of the Organic Law of Citizen Participation, which includes a multiplicity of mechanisms, bodies, spaces and procedures for self-organization of the social and the democratic dialogue between the State and society. We will promote the active use of the law in all areas of society and governance levels that structure the current Ecuadorian political order.

Proposal 27. Empowering the territories!
Posted on December 30, 2012 by pgpais
PHOTOS-PLAN-27

Advancing decentralization and deconcentration of State for territorial equity and to strengthen parish governments, municipal and provincial

Since 2007 there has been a breakthrough in the process of democratizing the State in order to attend to all the territories, especially those who have suffered the greatest inequity in the processes of production, capital accumulation and development, and have had less institutional care as a result of the historical concentration of resources and the lack of concern of the state.

The state plays a key role as guarantor of the rights of the population and in generating equitable conditions throughout the country. But it makes no sense to build the social systems from taxes "from above", without accepting that it is the 'local' needs, their social customs and practices (not their chiefdoms), which require a harmonious integration in the whole state. We must realize the territory from the regions and the regions from their territories; the national territory, from the local territory. The construction of different territorial polarities is an appropriate way to contest the deep sense of urban-rural regional asymmetries, and the prospect of a one-way globalization of capital that concentrates power.

The implementation of decentralization and deconcentration as forms of state organization seeking to improve the quality and coverage of public goods and services in the territories is conceived. These processes, together, seek distribute proportionally the power that historically has been concentrated in certain areas of the country to overcome regional inequalities and exclusions by different forms of government and executive presence in the territory.

Deepen the processes of decentralization of executive institutions to government agencies have increased administrative and capabilities that allow to serve the population of each part of the country allocations. greater powers and resources for the different levels of autonomous governments, in order to protect the national public policy and minimum standards (regulations) of government products and services are applied equitably and fairly in the territories will be decentralized.

Today we have 9 planning zones covering the entire national territory. Various ministries, especially in the areas of social, security and justice, have a planning and institutional organization that allows them to respond equitably and decentralized way, through the establishment of districts and circuits that facilitate the implementation of all the services people required. We deepen this process to consolidate institutional presence and rationalized and coordinated organization.

Also underway is the decentralization process, established in the Constitution and the Code of Territorial Organization, Autonomy and Decentralization, to be implemented by the National Decentralization Plan 2012-2015. We will promote and deepen this historic process to transfer all assigned powers, with the corresponding resources to prefectures, municipalities and parish councils across the country.

The decentralized autonomous governments should have greater capacities, skills and resources to serve all citizens, based on the principle that the State not only composes the central government but all levels of government, and beneficiaries of decentralization are not autonomous governments, but citizens, who will have better public services

Autonomy and decentralization are and must be the flags of the new Latin American left as part of the inclusion of more and better democracy for our society.

LINES OF ACTION

• Strengthen and expand the organization and coordination of the various levels of government. The proper functioning of the system of state powers, the system of decentralized and participatory planning, and harmony between decentralization and deconcentration. This will allow full articulation of all levels of government.

• Consolidate a collective, democratic and participatory planning by micro-planning and operational management in the territory. The landing of politics, management services and the guarantee of citizens' rights will be implemented in regions, districts and circuits nationwide.

• Deepening intersectoral in providing public services. Working at local level can generate synergies and complementarity in public interventions. We will continue the integrated work of different ministries to provide quality services close to the citizens. Add to this the coverage of basic services (water supply, sewerage, waste treatment) that are provided by the autonomous governments adds.

• Working for a progressive and supportive decentralization of powers and resources. Constitutional mandates on decentralization, in accordance with the National Decentralization Plan 2012-2015 will be met. This Plan seeks capacity building and strengthening of autonomous governments to exercise its powers.

Consolidate an efficient, effective, transparent and participatory public administration to resolve popular demands

If we recognize that there has been a need and an achievement redesign of state institutions, it should be even more optimal, effective and efficient operation. It is not enough just the fact of having the required institutions in the territory, but is its proper performance indispensable. This will be a priority for the next period of government because it is clear that our project is not committed to an inefficient "statism" but for a balanced scheme, where the state and its institutions serve with warmth and quality to citizens and their environment.

For the present state does not obstruct, but on the contrary, empowers society, we need accurate and appropriate interventions. We need to adapt the tools operation state and the current progress of governance. 

Therefore, the challenge involves, first, consolidate the transformation of the institutional architecture and deepening a territorial level, according to a model that recognizes the human being as subject and end. Transform public administration, placing greater emphasis on institutional capacity in the territories.

Secondly, it will remain a priority to modernize, improve and professionalize the Ecuadorian public service, traditionally characterized by excessive hierarchy in the decision-making process rigidity and poor training. We continue the transformation of the public service, based on the strengthening of democratic values, ethics of public employees and their professionalism. The consolidation of state support in the formation of human capital appropriately and adequately remunerated professionalized within an administrative career that emphasizes the merits and regularly assess their servers.

Third, the immediate introduction of instruments, techniques and procedures of the current information age, to promote innovation in the public service, so it is essential that it is efficient, effective, specialized and to achieve the empowerment of citizens on public affairs. For this it is essential to build open government based on transparency, accessibility and responsiveness; to restore confidence in public; that fits the demands of the complex information society; and to boost the opportunities of citizens to exercise their rights. The adoption of a results-based management tools and incorporating e-government, among others, will result in a more modern, efficient, effective and quality public administration.

Fourth, the Ecuadorian state must strengthen its regulatory role in a new regulatory framework. In this direction, it will launch a set of interventions and policy instruments aimed at the regulation and control of the financial system, the economic system, public services, strategic sectors, the environment, natural resources and land use.

 

LINES OF ACTION

• Continue streamlining the executive function. We undertook the most ambitious restructuring of the State and the Executive Branch and will continue.

We deepen the modernization of public institutions.

• Promote a culture of dignity, civic responsibility, quality and excellence in the provision of public services. We have great achievements in service coverage but we are not satisfied with their quality. Despite the growing favorable opinion that citizens have about the current quality of public services, this will be another priority of the new government. Compliance with different standards and quality parameters will be an obligation of public and private services, and control will be implemented and strengthened.

• Improve the capacity of regulation and state control. While in the period closes rescued public regulation, we have not developed and implemented with due regularity and thoroughness. Overcome the weakness in the application of the regulation, and will structure a state system of control around the Transparency and Social Control and its entities. We will support, while respecting their autonomy, new Superintendency of Control of Market Power and Popular Economy and Solidarity.

• Strengthen the organizational performance of public enterprises. At the stage of recovery and rescue, followed by the period of strengthening and strategic development. We achieve optimum performance and competent and coordinate their actions from principles and transparent corporate governance.

• Develop tools of governance to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness and quality. Our achievements have not only been structural, our public administration also ensures the quality, efficiency and effectiveness. We will make effective use of the tools of government and e-government results.

• Continuously improve the delivery of public services through the holistic development of the server, the adoption of international best practices in each service and international certification of excellence.

• To promote the training of civil servants as part of his professional career. Set the meritocratic career public servant, attracting the best Ecuadorian according to their capabilities. The role of the University of the State must be strengthened to contribute to the process.

• Provide the National Institute of Advanced Studies (IAEN) higher capacities in its role as School of Government and Public Administration, as well as the Vocational Training Service -SECAP- with complementary functions.

• Implement the National Program of Excellence internationally certify the quality of public services.

Proposal 29. Building the multinational state!
Posted on December 30, 2012 by pgpais
PHOTOS-PLAN-29

Promote the territorial government, intercultural dialogue and multinational public institutions at national and local level

Intercultural dialogue is only possible between equals, not when some cultures exert domination over others. The construction of the Plurinational State is a fundamentally political aspect that allows us to change the structures of colonial power that are still present in our country, and expressed in racist, sexist, discriminatory and exclusionary behavior.

Recognize in diversity is fighting domination processes more than five hundred years of history, opening possibilities for learning among cultures. Cultural difference never be an element of domination and oppression.

Plurinationality horizon is the construction of a new state, a new democracy and a new cohesive, inclusive, and generating complementarities for individual and collective well-being of the country society. The multi-nationality is not an issue of ethnic minorities, it is a process of building the new society.

The recognition of cultural diversity implies the transformation of the state from political pluralism and radicalization of democracy. Political equality from the plurinational state vision entails an institutional change such that creates institutions that allow exerting political equality for all peoples existing in the territories. Plurinationality is recognition to the authorities of peoples and nationalities, chosen according to their customs, within the unitary state on equal terms with other sectors of society.

LINES OF ACTION

• Incorporate the approaches of intercultural and plurinational in the new institutional architecture of the state. The old state opens its doors to incorporate the recognition of diversity within their own structures. Every time we have more public servants trained in an intercultural perspective, able to understand the needs of our peoples and nationalities.

• To support the creation of indigenous territorial districts, Afro-Ecuadorian and Montubio. The territorial districts receive their rightful public budget to meet the needs of its population. Their authorities will be recognized and respected. The communes will be the basis for building the new state.

• Generate public policies differentiated and territorially, to overcome the historical processes of exclusion of the nationalities and peoples of Ecuador and incorporating historical reparation processes.

• Reduce the historical gaps of our peoples and nationalities in education, health, housing, access to basic services, access to means of production and guarantee the exercise of collective rights. We will fight tirelessly to discrimination and exclusion.

• Develop genuinely intercultural public policies to exploit the knowledge and proposals from various organizations, peoples and nationalities of the country. An intercultural approach in public policy means ensuring that values ​​knowledge dialogue equally proposed that these towns offer in the development of policies that affect us all society.

• mechanisms to promote the effective participation of the nationalities and peoples in governance, as well as proposals for representation in the various social, political and state bodies. We will have more public servants indigenous, Afro-Ecuadorian and montubios. Instances of social participation in the State have a plural formation.

Revolution of sovereignty and integration
Posted on January 1, 2013 by pgpais
The Ecuador stopped being a reactive country for an active foreign policy. His voice is heard in the various international fora where innovative proposals raised rupture, which are studied by specialists in the international arena: the new International Financial Architecture; the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC); interpellation constant international organizations where there is supremacy of capital over the interests of human beings; questioning those organizations that defend the interests of the owners of large international media, under the code of conduct aberrant defend corporate interests above the interests of citizens; the Yasuni-ITT novedosapropuesta to keep the oil underground in exchange for an international responsibility; strengthening Latin American integration; firmness against external aggression or coups that are still present in our America, such as Honduras and Paraguay.

Serious threats of the contemporary world, involving the whole of humanity-the growth of organized crime and violence, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, global economic and environmental crises - require globally coordinated responses which can only come from binding decisions issued by truly democratic international organizations, which have disappeared forever special interests, veto rights and the dictates of the powerful.

This strategic objective reconfiguration of the international order is possible only through effective coordination among the countries of the South. In this regard, South-South integration and strengthening mechanisms for regional integration strategies are essential, without which it is impossible to accumulate the necessary reconfiguration of global power dynamics of political power.


Proposal 30. The lofty South!
Posted on January 1, 2013 by pgpais
PHOTOS-PLAN-30

Advance the construction of a multipolar world, strengthen national sovereignty and integration of the peoples of the South, and consolidate the principle of Citizen Diplomacy.

Citizen Revolution has recovered its sovereignty, before subordinated to international interests. Our foreign policy seeks to expand foreign relations to new frontiers, without tutelage or impositions, with respect for international law and peaceful means, but also according to the interests of our people, whose term answer. We have strengthened our position in Latin America and the world. We continue to implement a policy of strategic and sovereign insertion. We continue to expand our political and economic relations to a greater number of countries in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Far East, Africa and Latin America, with the aim of strengthening South-South relations and form a bloc of countries resist the abuse of military, political and economic power of the great international powers.

The Ecuador is no longer subservient to the interests of the hegemonic countries country. The Citizen Revolution has given our foreign policy discourse and practice sovereign, independent, that now represent the country's interests and not those of the economic and political elites. We are a dynamic, innovative country with a purposeful and proactive policy, both in terms of our bilateral relations and in multilateral forums, where voice and Ecuador are transforming proposals of reference for decision-making. Our vision is long-term, fundamental transformation of the international order. However, we are aware that a strong stance in international forums is not enough. Therefore, and to advance the construction of a more just and peaceful world, Ecuador raises a radical action by the reform of the international order and its institutions, to build a new multilateralism, democratic, universal, in the service of peace and developing states and their peoples. The aim is to give the world a new architecture of global governance, where international law is respected and to ensure respect; where all states have equal rights and obligations, and where measures of force proscribe.

For the new period 2013-2017 we plan to radicalize the human mobility agenda of the Government of the Citizen Revolution. We postulate the principle of universal citizenship. While rich countries preach free movement of goods, persecute migrants. For us human beings are more important than the goods. We continue to defend the rights of our migrants abroad and promoting the integration of foreigners in our country. Ecuador is united and believes in the peaceful resolution of conflicts. Faced with international conflicts, we never close our borders to accommodate asylum seekers and refugees.

Civic Diplomacy articulates those actions taken by the foreign service to protect and facilitate the exercise of rights of Ecuadorian men and women, living outside the country. The aim is to deepen the supply and quality of services provided in places where lies the Ecuadorian population, which helps maintain and strengthen their families, community, cultural, political, economic and scientific links. This approach seeks to have a more human and close contact with our migrants.

LINES OF ACTION

Proposal 31. The Patria Grande!
Posted on January 1, 2013 by pgpais
PHOTOS-PLAN-31

Deepening regional integration, the use of regional funding mechanisms of productive development, the New Regional Financial Architecture and South-South cooperation.

Ecuador promotes the regional construction processes according to the principles of the new Latin American regionalism, recovering the role of society and the state over the market. The main objective is to create a Latin American space, autonomous and self-sufficient decision, more collective bargaining power, as opposed to deregulation promoted by the centers of global power. This will provide the region's political, commercial and financial mechanisms to stimulate the development of the peoples of our America; increase economic and social cohesion, and strengthen democratic institutions and the ability to resolve conflicts peacefully. The region has recognized the leadership and initiative of Ecuador as a driver of regional unity and has granted Quito headquarters of UNASUR.

It has begun the transformation of the Ecuadorian Foreign Service. We have rejected the neo-colonial paradigms and instruments. Public officials now serve the national interest, not fads or agendas of the hegemonic countries.

Advances in the construction of the Latin American institutions have materialized in consolidating bodies such as UNASUR and ALBA, which also serve as outlines policy coordination mechanisms are strong, operational and dynamic regional integration; plus real poles generation of social, political, commercial, financial and economic interdependence among its members. This is one of the fundamental objectives of the Ecuadorian foreign policy, whose realization will limit the imposition of policies and models that favor the powerful. The challenge is that these institutions consolidate a position block on global and inter-American organizations like the United Nations, the World Trade Organization (WTO), the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the Organization of American States (OAS).

In the field of regional integration organizations emerge and initiatives of the New Regional Financial Architecture is consolidated. The South Bank is configured as an essential tool to promote productive investment in our region. The South Fund appears as a background of regional monetary sovereignty to support countries in the region, to invest the hundreds of millions of dollars are now deposited in Northern economies. The South Fund will operate as an alternative to conditional funds from international financial institutions. Finally, the System of Regional Compensation (SUCRE) will help eliminate dependence on a non-regional currency in the context of regional trade.

We want the South Bank is the institution for promoting investment in the development of UNASUR redirect the huge financial savings in the region. A central goal is to support specific initiatives to strengthen the ties of regional integration, according to the five sovereignty embodied in the Agreement Establishing the South Bank: food sovereignty, sovereignty of health, knowledge sovereignty, energy sovereignty and sovereignty natural resources. In particular, support productive projects of regional importance as a grand-national railway system, creating grand-national companies (public or mixed) for joint projects, favoring intraregional procurement and coordinate demand and supply in intergovernmental areas.

As a key element of the new framework of relations among sovereign states that Ecuador is advocated an agenda for international cooperation based on solidarity, willingness to share successful experiences and rapprochement between countries in the South. Ecuador, for the first time in history, not only receiving international aid, but also offers cooperation to towns and neighboring countries. Solidarity assistance, committed to the development, respectful of the sovereignty of countries. Solidarity is for Ecuador a central axis of a new anti-imperialist international cooperation.

LINES OF ACTION

• To promote the institutionalization of ALBA and UNASUR as spaces for political, social and economical for the construction of a multipolar world convergence. Working for these institutions to overcome the logic of "market integration" and continue walking towards a strategic integration in all areas: social, economic, political, cultural, etc.

• Consolidate the CELAC as an institution that is able to enhance cooperation, dialogue and regional integration and increase the bargaining power of its members to third parties, in multilateral spaces and other international venues.

Green revolution
Posted on January 3, 2013 by pgpais
The government of the Citizen Revolution assumed since its inception committed to defending the right of people to live in a healthy environment and respect for the rights of nature. He had the support and commitment of social actors linked to the struggle for economic, social and environmental rights. These rights were enshrined in the Constitution, turning Ecuador into a world leader, being the first country in the world that recognizes the rights of nature in its constitutional framework.

Ecuador loves life. We have an unwavering commitment to nature. One of the biggest challenges for the multiple crises facing the world is the need to redefine the relationship between economy, society and nature. This redefinition must ensure measures of democratization and redistribution of wealth leading to inclusion and equity. It also has to be a guarantee of respect for the thresholds established by nature; It ie its capacity to regenerate and its right to exist and continue. The climate crisis and the crisis of extinction of species, for example, reveal a mismatch between the ecological dynamics and patterns of accumulation and growth.

Six years after exercise of the Government of the Citizen Revolution, constitutional advances in the rights of people and nature, as well as guarantees for Good Living, in the framework of a plurinational and intercultural State, they have achieved position and enjoy great recognition. In this scenario, the Yasuni-ITT Initiative, which seeks to leave oil in the ground in exchange for international compensation, as a sign of responsibility to environmental issues, is perhaps the most symbolic proposal. Initiative synthesizes an alternative to Good Living and commitments in environmental matters has prompted the Citizen Revolution, with broad support from the national and international community.

The Citizen Revolution consolidates its commitment to restore and maintain a healthy and ecologically balanced environment that guarantees good living and the rights of nature. This is done by implementing effective policies and management that extend the vision of conservation of natural heritage. The main instrument for achieving this goal is the implementation of the National Biodiversity Strategy that will integrate its multiple values ​​and generate goods and services from conservation, research and restoration of ecosystems, for which human talent will formed to promote innovation, technology, knowledge and ancestral wisdom that allows us to effectively move toward bio-knowledge society the way.

Changing production will genuinely "green country" because it will have greater economic, social and environmental value. This will be achieved by deepening the sustainable use of natural heritage and natural resources, the inclusion of environmentally clean technologies, expanding energy efficiency and renewable energies, prevention, control and mitigation of pollution. This means doing things differently with entrepreneurs that produce eco-efficient and so that citizens make sustainable consumption. The implementation of the National Climate Change Strategy is one of the fundamental elements to change the relationship between human beings and nature in the various productive sectors.

The institutions will also be transformed to ensure environmental rights and nature. Organic environment code and enact the constitutional mandate to have an environmental supervision will be fulfilled. The Ecuador maintained its leadership positions at the international level on environment, sustainability and Good Living to achieve a change of consciousness in the country and the planet.

Respect the rights of nature, habitat and our life through the conservation, appreciation and sustainable use of natural resources and terrestrial and marine biodiversity, considered as a strategic sector.

Our Constitution affirms the right of everyone to live in a healthy and pollution-free environment. And it goes further. In keeping with the paradigm of Good Living enshrines the rights of nature or Pacha Mama. This major breakthrough should be underpinned by the development of guarantees, regulations and standards of protection, including legal, political and institutional instruments; as well as policies to promote research and knowledge of their cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes.

Land use planning and the search for sustainable human settlements in urban and rural areas are priority to population dynamics are accompanied by effective systems for managing basic services, expansion of natural areas considered public property, location of national strategic projects in areas with lower pressures and prevention of environmental pollution. Territorial interventions will value the natural heritage by creating protected tourist areas; the expansion of protected natural areas in the coastal marine area; consolidating biosphere reserve zones; ecosystem restoration; and the application of legal mechanisms and standards for certification to improve the performance of land management.

The new productive matrix of Ecuador poses substantial challenges to incorporate measures for sustainable production in sectors that have a high economic potential and demand the use of natural resources on a large scale. This involves the formation of human talent and the incorporation of technologies that, from the planning stage of interventions, ensure handling of natural resources within ecological limits of the territory. Mining and infrastructure activities involve not only the removal of vegetation, but the alteration of habitats of species of fauna apart from the effect on the ecological functions of the entire environment. This understanding will be present in the design, selection of intervention sites and the implementation of projects.

LINES OF ACTION

• Preserve the natural heritage and its terrestrial and marine biodiversity, considered as a strategic sector. Initiatives to conserve forests, mangroves, deserts, mountains and diverse terrestrial and marine ecosystems of Ecuador, with the participation of stakeholders and the State, will be strengthened to exercise the rights of nature. It will work to protect biodiversity, particularly species and endemic and native varieties under the precautionary principle by regulating the entry and exit of alien species; and protect endangered species. The National Biodiversity Strategy is the instrument to guide action at national and regional level to promote biodiversity as a strategic sector.

• Stop deforestation, despite the efforts of these six years of government, remains a potential threat to the ecosystems. This is one of the legacies of the past. Greening and reforestation Homeland strengthen forest governance work, optimizing controls and incentives for the conservation of forests; training and expansion of favoring its location rangers in protected areas; watershed protection, especially those that are degraded; and sustainable forestry. We will make great effort to reforest citizen, providing for the expansion of nurseries of native species, application of improved seeds and seedlings with planting and maintenance to facilitate the repopulation of vegetation in the country.

• Deepen ocean and coastal management to conserve the natural and cultural heritage, ecosystems and biodiversity of marine and coastal area, respecting the rights of nature in continental Ecuador, the Galapagos Archipelago, the territorial sea, the area next, the exclusive economic zone and the Antarctic, where the priority actions are to prevent, control and mitigate pollution of national maritime areas and coastal areas. Coastal and marine awareness in the national population will deepen.

• Research to understand and sustainably use biodiversity. basic research will be promoted and applied to complete the knowledge on natural and semi-natural ecosystems in the country, and integrate it into an information system on national biodiversity generated by public and private entities, both in terms of assets and their valuation. We will make an inventory of the information from the national natural heritage and ancestral knowledge on biodiversity and ecosystem services and ecosystem to identify their potential, eco-regional and evaluation skills. This research will accompany compared against existing sustainable uses of biodiversity promoted in Ecuador and other countries, and appropriate legislation on biosafety.

• Transform biodiversity products and services that are valued by society and preserve their heritage. Diversifying the productive matrix of the country and the improvement in the trade balance is being achieved with the offer conscious and sustainable tourism whose center are the attractions that the country has and will continue to support. The Ecuador Love Life campaign will be expanded to achieve these objectives. A wide range of opportunities for the generation of products and services in the areas such as agro-biodiversity, biomedicine, new materials, bio-architecture, bioremediation, renewable and sustainable energy, among others.

• Deepening the recognition of water as a human right common good, strategic heritage. There is a serious problem of destruction of sources and pollution of water bodies. We will put the best efforts to control and reverse these practices recovering and maintaining the hydrological dynamics through integrated and comprehensive planning and watershed and bodies of surface and ground water management. This makes it possible to have the quantity and quality needed to provide the populations of water available for irrigation, ensure environmental flow and water availability for hydropower generation activities and productive uses. The use of appropriate and sustainable for concentrates and scattered settlements incorporate technologies. Strengthen institutions and forms of social participation in water management

• To promote sustainable patterns of production and consumption. From the production side, the productive transformation expand the incorporation of environmentally clean technologies, energy efficiency and the use of environmental innovations from industrial ecology mimic the functioning of ecosystems where nothing is wasted. They deepen their care processes natural heritage, for which the eco-efficient use of materials, water and energy, with a focus on prevention, control and mitigation of pollution that generates cleaner processes and products are promoted. We will continue with the process of social and environmental remediation of environmental liabilities. On the consumption side, the strategies of citizen environmental education management from the sufficiency and consumption, allowing informed decisions to reject harmful or unnecessary products, reduce consumption, recover and recycle materials are strengthened.

• To prepare the country to reduce social and environmental vulnerability against extreme weather events, and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in productive and social sectors. The National Climate Change Strategy will act as an integrating tool for the various sectors and territories through effective adaptation and mitigation actions. Adaptation measures in priority sectors involve as food sovereignty, agriculture, livestock, aquaculture and fisheries; productive and strategic sectors; health, water heritage; and natural heritage, in consideration of the priority groups. Consider mitigation actions in the sectors of energy, industry, waste and agriculture, forestry and other land uses. Risk management is considered a cross-cutting practices to improve preparedness, response and recovery. Responsiveness to tackle climate change requires consideration in investment decisions, production and consumption.

• Consolidate the territorial land use and habitat-eco landscape with a systemic approach. This involves implementing a planned process of political, technical and administrative, whose main purpose is to organize, harmonize and manage the occupation and use of space, so that they contribute to Good Living in harmony with nature. In land use planning must converge demographic, social, cultural and environmental policies that allow managing the territorial space to transform the current situation characterized by unequal and disorderly practices and achieve desired conditions from an environmental, social, cultural and spatial view . This will allow for sustainable urban and rural settlements and identity, as well as command and control the expansion of the agricultural frontier through actions to optimize production without colonize new natural areas, particularly in fragile or threatened ecosystems.

• To organize and coordinate the legal standards guaranteeing the right to live in a healthy environment and recognize the rights of nature. These standards are reflected in the Code of the Environment will be an effective tool for sustainable environmental management in diverse and complementary, such as forests, biodiversity, environmental quality issues, among others. This regulatory body scattering legal and regulatory instruments that exist today will be overcome. The Code of the Environment will become the legal instrument that regulates environmental issues and establish responsibility between the institutions and individuals to exercise their right to live in a healthy and sustainable environment. One of the innovations of this code are the provisions on the use and utilization of genetic resources, ancestral knowledge and public and private, national and international scientific research on Ecuadorian territory.

• Strengthen the commitment to nature that has taken place the Government of the Citizen Revolution in international forums. Ecuador seeks to create a new geopolitical with approaches from the south take power on the basis of recognition of the ecological debt, the responsibility in the management of environmental public goods and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. The country will continue to drive innovative, such as the Universal Declaration on the Rights of Nature as an instrument to achieve Good Living, the Net Avoided Emissions mechanism (ENE), Daly-Correa tax, issuing Special Drawing Rights initiatives The tax on international financial transactions; the transparency of information on financing provided by developed to developing countries for adaptation to climate change mitigation, technology transfer and capacity building, among others. In this way we determine the change in the rules of the game through alliances with countries that promote a transformation of the international order.

Deepen political strategy to consolidate the Yasuní - ITT and keep the oil underground

The Yasuni-ITT Initiative is an innovative project presented by the government of the Citizen Revolution with the United Nations in 2007. This initiative has become a global symbol in the fight against climate change, conservation biodiversity and intergenerational justice. It is an important example of the application of a public policy that social justice with ecological urgency, challenging the clash between the short deadline imposed by the process of capital accumulation and the conditions for longer times of sustainability, that is, the contradiction living planet between the times of capital and nature. Our country, through the choice of leaving the oil underground, decided to protect the rich biodiversity in this part of the Yasuni National Park.

The Commission in charge of fundraising internationally continues its work despite the difficult context of economic and financial crisis. International contributions to northern countries based on two fundamental arguments are requested in the context of combating climate change: the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities to environmental problems; and ecological debt of the rich countries to poor countries. The most important challenges facing the Yasuni-ITT Initiative are the collection and expenditure of funds, showing results to different taxpayers (and possible future), and meet the high expectation of the people who support the Yasuni-ITT Initiative.

LINES OF ACTION

• Strengthening the dissemination of the project and fundraising in the global civil society, social organizations, environmentalists, associations and the general public in order to make people aware that alternatives to current policies mercantilist policies to fight against climate change can be implemented at government level.

• Position the Yasuni-ITT Initiative in various regional and international forums and proposals for combating climate change and biodiversity conservation is driving our country.

• Work with regional and local institutions in the North. These decentralized levels of government can be important sources of financial revenue. Our embassies in the world selected the possible institutions that could contribute to the trust.

• Continue with the socialization of the Yasuni-ITT Initiative in the Ecuadorian population to get popular support for the project and expand the knowledge about the natural wealth of our country and its different realities, including the reality of indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation.

• decarbonise energy sector favoring investment in changing the energy mix to renewable energies. That means considering demand for household energy, transport and industry and diversify the supply of renewable energy by investing in solar, wind, geothermal and biomass energy. These projects need to conduct studies efficient investment. Another type of investment needed and priority through the payment of the social debt to the peoples of the Amazon. The selection of projects (education, health, basic public services, ecotourism, sustainable activities, etc.) be carried out with their participation.

Urban revolution
Posted on January 4, 2013 by pgpais
One of the central problems of the country at the moment is urban chaos and disorder. That is why we propose an urban revolution. It is necessary to advance strongly in the field of land use and urban planning in order to move towards the construction of a habitable territory, both in rural and urban areas, as well as to be efficient and effective in providing public services . Improve the quality of life of seats is our goal. The mandate of the right to the city encourages us to move forward in partnership with GADs in public spaces recovery, pollution control, strengthening the identity of cities, access to decent housing and the efficient allocation friendly utilities with nature.

The creation and revitalization of public space encourages participation and civic responsibility, and should be understood as a support material of relationships and social practices, cultural demonstrations and recreation. Construction of Good Living implies that citizens have the time necessary for creative leisure and recreation for the common meeting, sports, shared growth, the exchange of knowledge and experiences. To achieve these objectives we will promote the recovery of public spaces, those spaces of encounter, recreation and learning.

We humanized cities convene us to live in them, cross them, to enjoy, to grow humanly. Cities that guarantee decent housing and adequate mobility with excellent public transport systems and efficiency

Proposal 34. The city is not private loot!

Ensure social and environmental role of urban land for the right to the full enjoyment of the city as a public space. Promote decent housing guaranteeing the universality of urban services: water supply, sewerage, solid waste management and energy.

The sustained growth of the urban population that characterizes the country since the sixties of the last century led to a haphazard urban development, without planning, regulation or control; lacking in the performance of basic services and with deep territorial asymmetries (neighborhoods of extreme wealth and extreme poverty neighborhoods). Urban segregation large popular sectors excluded from access to housing and a safe habitat due to speculative real estate practices rents optimized through the incorporation of soil irrational. The lack of urban planning also caused the lack of social, cultural and territorial diversities; exacerbation of individualism and consumption and fragmentation of cities.

Exercising the right to the city involves building a political proposal to vindicate the possibility that people again become masters of the city and making the city the meeting point for the construction of collective life. The floor is crucial to improving the quality of life and an important tool of governance, as the conditions for locating human activities, access and production of income associated with soil affect the whole of society.

To improve the quality of life in the towns, under the mandate of the right to the city, it is necessary to advance in the control of urban growth to prevent the scattered cities and to optimize the performance of existing cities. It is important to strengthen the local authority to control speculative land use either by property sectors like land traffickers. We must foster the balance between green spaces and built spaces; advance the recovery and use of public space; provide the cities of financing programs for the recovery and promotion of their heritage and enhance public awareness of the role of cities in ecosystems.

You need to recover public spaces, control pollution, strengthen the identity of cities and provide them with basic services friendly to nature. A comprehensive vision of public space must necessarily include natural protection areas and urban green areas that are essential to ensure the sustainability of cities.

Dignify the lives of those living in the city is related to the realization of rights. The urban revolution involves the construction of cities and vision to ensure universal access to decent housing with all basic services and quality. The universal service should include water supply, sewerage, waste collection and electricity to bridge the gaps that still exist between urban and rural areas. The urban revolution must ensure equity in the territories.

The provision of potable water and sewerage are municipal powers GADs but represent a national priority. It is necessary to establish a national policy to expand coverage of these basic services.

LINES OF ACTION

• Continue to combat land invasions and the creation of illegal neighborhoods uninhabitable areas. Already installed neighborhoods recover from the hands of land speculators regaining control of public space and the land ownership by autonomous governments. Relocate neighborhoods installed in areas at risk from natural hazards.

• Establish policies that allow the redistribution of income related to land use in achieving greater equity and inclusion.

• To regulate the land market. Intervene with public policies to avoid factors that increase exclusion, socio-spatial segregation, environmental degradation and poor living conditions. Generate a supply of land for regulating the market in the city and its surroundings.

• Ensure access to urban land and housing, particularly in the poorest sectors of the population.

• Provide, in accordance with the GADs, the configuration of new centers in cities, with provision of urban infrastructure, health, education and recreation to democratize access of citizens to these services.

• Prioritize the creation and promotion of equitably distributed and inclusive public spaces such as parks, community centers and libraries.

• Increase investment from the central government and local governments for the provision of potable water, sewage, waste collection and electricity, trying to close the urban divide - rural. Gradually we will ensure coverage by sewerage networks and connections in urban areas, urban and rural sub under the principle of territorial equity.

• Ensure garbage collection and efficient management of solid waste that allow waste reduction, recycling and ecological processes reutilización.Promocionar biodegradable solid waste and wastewater, together with environmental education programs.

• Promote the efficient use of all resources.

• Ensure the technical closure of landfills and construction of new landfills.

• Promote the development of smart cities in order to increase energy efficiency and productivity, and improve mobility problems and decentralization of services.

• Build a pollution free environment to ensure the health of citizens and the development of their capabilities, by regulating emissions.

35. Proposal safe and sustainable mobility!
Posted on January 4, 2013 by pgpais

Ensure the right to mobility and road safety, order and expand public transport and non-motorized mobility.

Mobility has been characterized by a disruption to the dynamics of population growth and land use. Poor urban planning led to a disjointed public services has not provided the public an adequate infrastructure commensurate with their access necesidades.Las cities grew in a disorderly and chaotic; transport was marked by corporate and union interests that took advantage of the conditions of deregulation for their benefit to the detriment of citizens. All this led us to be mistreated users; we become usuariossumisos and liabilities. The daily human mobility is not just a functional issue. Mobility is like life itself, absorbs a person's time, distances, stress. It is an issue that should be of major attention from all levels of government: the executive and decentralized autonomous governments.

In this context bets in the field of mobility as the construction of the Quito Metro and Tram in the city of Cuenca, where the national government is investing enormous resources. It opens us a historic opportunity to view the issue of transport with all its various ramifications and see solutions they see the future of our cities.

The growth of our cities, characterized by low population densities, a horizontal expansion and an inefficient public transport system, has led to massive and irrational use of lighter cars.

This rapid increase in the number of vehicles is the cause of congestion, which not only lengthens journey times, subtracting personal, family or productive time, but has negative consequences for air quality and the use of public space. Moreover, this phenomenon that goes beyond urban road capabilities is also a form of social exclusion, since only a quarter of Ecuadorian families have their own car. Although congestion affects everyone, it has more serious effects on people with lower consumption capabilities.

It is therefore essential to foster a good quality public transport, expressed not only in its territorial coverage, ease of access, hours of operation and safety of the buses, but also in the energy and environmental impact they generate.

 LINES OF ACTION

• To foster the widespread use of public transport, safe, dignified and sustainable in cities; and promote alternative forms of mobility recognizing the pedestrian priority. Implement measures to discourage excessive use of private vehicles.

• Recover and extend the railway network, a means of clean, safe and efficient transport.

• Promote and technically support GADs in formulating local mobility plans that favor sustainable public transport alternatives.

• Citizens must continue taking us to the streets. Create a culture that breaks with the centrality of the automobile, which respects the cyclist and the pedestrian and recognize their right to move. Promote the use of bicycles as a means of daily transport, building bicycle lanes and encouraging national manufacture. Seek a cultural shift towards widespread use of this medium to have positive impacts not only for mobility but also for the environment and human health. The plans in this direction deserve financial support for implementation through special credit lines from the State Bank.

• Promoverincentivos and technical assistance for adopting integrated models of public transport in the cantons rural and urban areas, through the articulation of those lines and urban services routes with higher capacity and speed.

• Develop mechanisms to facilitate citizen participation and civic action in monitoring the quality of public transport, in coordination with the audit to be carried out GADs, supported by the introduction of new technologies such as satellite tracking devices to control stops and speed, automatic fare collection systems and media users.

• Accelerate the process of improving the quality of diesel used in buses, particularly with regard to reducing sulfur levels in such a way to make possible the progressive renewal of the vehicle fleet with better technologies and better environmental performance energy efficiency, with financial support of the RENOVA Plan.

• Strengthen public transport regulation and management capacities of decentralized autonomous governments.
