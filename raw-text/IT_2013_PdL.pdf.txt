Rome, February 2013

I do not remember a time in my life more difficult than this:

people are really disheartened.
They went down again in the field because I can not leave
sinking the wholesale ireland drift hopeless.
The caretaker government Monti has chosen to follow the policy of austerity
germanocentrica imposed by Europe and the depressing results are below
for all to see.
I had hoped that my step back favored an agreement to do
institutional reform and make Italy ungovernable as other
great democracies.
Instead the opposition have undermined our proposal and the government
the technician has indulged.
Our institutional system prevents modernization
can be: the premier has fewer powers of the mayor of the smallest
common.
For this reason we were unable to complete the liberal revolution.
I have already apologized Italians: I was in good faith because I
I was under the illusion that we could do.
However our years of government have not gone in vain.
We have initiated reforms in all areas: school, university, work,
pensions, taxation, tourism, immigration, government,
great works, security foreign policy.
Some of them are bearing fruit, others are to be completed,
others have been deleted by the governments of the left or by referendum.

4

Now we want to leave Italy, restoring confidence Italians
with simple and effective measures: we abolish the IMU,
We put an end to the tax police, as we will defend
always made Italy's interests in Europe, we will not put
new taxes, as it strives to make the left of Bersani and Vendola,
with the spare tire of Monti.
We want to bridge the gap between Italians and politics: for this
our MPs will vote the halving of their salaries,
the end of public financing of political parties, constitutional reform
with a halving of the number of MPs and the powers in the government
needed to put us on a par with other democracies.
We will do everything if we have his vote and that of the majority
the Italians.
Do not give in to despair, he does not believe those who say that nothing will ever change.
I became a grandfather for the seventh time in this campaign
election but do not stop having ideals and plans for the future.
My ideals, our ideals - person, freedom, subsidiarity, family,
federal, state services to citizens, fair justice - are stronger
and alive than ever.
To affirm I fought a hundred battles, facing victories
and defeats, as always in life. For this I have made
of all colors, yet I still believe!
