3. FOR secularism 'AND
FREEDOM '

We want to live in a State respectful of
every religion but secular in fact and not just
in word, in which all have the same
rights

the
same
freedom
regardless of skin color,
by the people to which you belong, by

in a country where self-determination
of women over their own lives and their own
bodies is a reality: a country
where companies and institutions are permeated
on the combination of equality and freedom of
men and women.
The Constitution says that Italy must
be a country so free, secular and that
He defends the rights of all.
We are a culture that values
differences. The reality is quite different. The

homosexuals who want to marry and
can not, women who meet
thousand obstacles if they ask to use the
assisted reproduction, the children of immigrants
who, though born in Italy, citizens
Italians are not. For all of them, and for many
others, ours is not a country
secular, not a free country, is not a
Country that respects its Constitution.

4. FOR THE JOB
The Italian workers have wages among the most
lowest in Europe. Pay taxes among the most
high of the EU. The last governments with
dramatic
increase
of
unemployment (the historical high with
11.1% and 36.5% among young people with
spikes of 50% in the areas of
noon) and layoffs
(More than 1 billion hours in 2012 with a
wage loss of about 7,000 per year
each worker) demonstrate the inability of

SCHOOL: RETURN TO
CONSTITUTION
The counter-reforms launched by Minister
Gelmini since 2008
represented the deepest and organic
attack on public schools, drawing
an impoverished school system - in
resources, in time and quality - of
inspiration openly classist. They
enroll in a plan, which is to be
away, crushing system

school and destruction of its
constitutional foundations brought forward
Also from the Monti government, with the competition
the political forces that have
supported. It is no coincidence that Italy is
any European country that spends
less and less for education as a proportion
the wealth produced. On the side
parliamentary majority PD-PDLUDC was responsible, with
approval in the House of Design
former law Aprea, a further boost
towards privatization of the system

denial of school democracy.

UNIVERSITIES AND RESEARCH
The public university, designed by

democracy. Similarly the character

guaranteed as strategic axis of
development.
We want

Gelmini-Nose: continuity in

The "Gelmini reforms" university opposed by a large movement of
students, precarious and temporary workers, researchers introduced new and very heavy

is
privatization. The role ANVUR, and a
questionable

the precariousness, another pick

We want above all to re-open the doors

On public research
We should also go on investing
public research and public agencies of
research, safeguarding primarily the
social patronage of the research itself,
the Wizard, the fundamental one. The
research institutions has, in fact, the function of
monitor and provide items to make

more effective institutional policies on
