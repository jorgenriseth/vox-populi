Politicians have failed, now you are talking. The elections of June 9, 2010 are the most important elections since times. Now you decide who you put in the hands of the management of society. Do you trust the
right parties? Do you believe that the free market will solve all problems? That politics can do banks
save, but can take no responsibility for society? In place of the old sound
social breakdown we put a new perspective of social reconstruction. Of human dignity, equality and solidarity. You can say it. You must decide.

The crisis of casino capitalism

23

People we gave us confidence, took irresponsible risks. By graai- and grasping behavior of
bankers, speculators, managers and shareholders, and looking away from those who were to supervise. Everywhere, governments are forced to pour money into expensive tax almost bottomless pits bench. They
which themselves ridiculous salaries, bonuses and winnings attributed, have the economics of a casino
created. Never before have we seen such an embarrassing exposure of the political and economic elite. They
look stupid, but people stand in front of the block. Millions of people, everywhere in the world, lose
their jobs and livelihoods. The greed of a few leads to real hunger for many.

32

Who reads our manifesto Quite man from 1999, we see that when we warned of what is now
happened. Most political parties in the Netherlands gave their views and ideals for one or
Another form of neo-liberal thinking. Politicians from right to left were led by the lazy notion
that the free market can do everything better. And refused even to take more responsibility for society. It's not nice to get right afterwards. Now every party says it never had so far allowed
come. Now everyone says that it is never so out of hand allowed to run. It is not enough that politicians
repent. Politicians should not but interpret the world, they must change the world.

The fourth Balkenende government was the government of the missed opportunities. In 2006, many voters chose
a progressive and social direction. Thus we had the beacons can resist. But while the SP
won the elections, were the losers CDA and PvdA the new cabinet. Balkenende did not
SP, Woods did not dare. So the Netherlands had a government that no one wanted. CDA, PvdA and Christian Union ruled with their backs to the voters. They have three years of squabbling and postponed major decisions. This country now needs a stable and social government. The SP is ready for a government
which does make choices:

building a more humane, more social and sustainable Netherlands. How, we tell you in this election. *

People who have no part in the economic crisis now threatening to have to pay the bill.
Where politicians in a jiffy spending billions to the banks, they now want to cut billions in the
society. No doubt, the crisis came from the right. Parties that provided plenty of room for bankers and
directors, shareholders and speculators, bear a heavy responsibility. They chose private
wealth and public poverty. They are uitgeregeerd, it must change.

11

We will in the coming years have to clean up the rubble from the right. Those who caused the crisis
and most benefited, let's first and most pay. We need another crisis
try to avoid. Demacht of banks, large corporations and shareholders, we build ties and
power of speculators we break. And the influence of citizens, we make a lot bigger.

But governing is more than distribute the pain fairly. The next four years we want with less money anyway a
humane and socially Netherlands put into the pipeline. By stopping the sale of this public
services and to put an end to scrabbling at the top. By getting people into work and keep them. And
small businesses by helping the crisis. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses provide much renovation
and employment. In our report Heart of the matter, we explain how this more true entrepreneurs
will offer support.

Our suggestions

30
• People get more control over what all of us. We stop the sale of
public services and social housing and rotate the sell back whenever possible. Government
is again primarily responsible for the organization of good care and good education, adequate
public transport and renewable energy.

31
32
33
34
35

• We will put a stop to top incomes. Administrators in the public and semi-public sector earn more than the Prime Minister. We support the efforts of trade unions to all workers
To accommodate the company collective labor agreements, so that there is a link between the highest and lowest incomes
and the division is prevented. Extension of collective agreements remains.

36
37
38
39
40

• The state pension remains a national insurance scheme, the retirement age remains 65 years and early retirement remains possible.
People do have the right to continue working after the age of 65, with the same rights and obligations as other
employees. We need to help people to 65 years to work and keep working.

41
42
43
44

• There is not tampered with the dismissal. We are opposed to the shortening of the duration of the
WW. The job requirement is dependent on the individual circumstances and the prospects
completed work.

45
46
47
48

• We create a new national investment bank. Which will provide loans to healthy and well
run companies, which now from ordinary banks to obtain credit.

49
50
51

• A bank levy, banks contribute to the resolution of the damage they have previously
caused. We try to do it internationally. But if you must, we do it ourselves, like Belgium and
the United States.

• Banks receiving State may not pay bonuses. In government and public corporations, we also stop giving bonuses. With other companies bonuses
the next four years and then limited abolished.

4
5
6

8

• Providing high irresponsible mortgages we prohibit. This prevents abuses.
Fees are capped and replaced eventually by an hourly fee or subscription system.
For certain categories of products - such as insurance - an exception can be made.

9
10
11
12

• The mortgage interest is guaranteed and capped in the next decade, 350,000
euro mortgage. At a maximum tax of 42 percent. The repayment of mortgage debt is encouraged.

13
14
15
16

• The financial sector will be thoroughly reformed to prevent future derailments. With a
New Nationalisation we give the government the opportunity to intervene faster in failing banks
and insurers.

17
18
19
20
21

• We separate savings and investment banks. Thus we prevent banks from ever gamble with the savings
of their customers. We do this at European level. In the meantime, should Dutch banks
already separate internal risky and less risky activities. The reserve requirements for banks
sharper.

22
23
24

• New financial products are now checked beforehand by the Financial
Markets. Which intervenes promptly if these products are no good, as with profiteering policies.

25
26
27

• On hot money is clamped set internationally. Hedge funds that abuse
the free movement of capital, be addressed.

28
29
30

• Buyout Funds acquire companies and empty food like locusts, we clipped. Below
others by limiting the interest deduction on income taxes.

31
32
33
34

• Using less power for shareholders and more power for workers we bring in more stability
large enterprises. Employees of these companies can quadrennial half the members of the
Supervisory Board choose.

35
36

• The tax does not exclude deals with multinationals. Which also have to pay normal taxes.

37
38
39
40

• There will be more legal options to address wanpresterende directors. Civilian
liability of directors will be expanded. There will be a separate penal provision
financial mismanagement.

41
42
43
44

• A Global Financial Authority, which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) goes up, must
financial system better protection. Other countries - outside the G20 - are getting a firmer voice.
The World Bank is also democratized.

45
46
47
48

• The dollar operates instability in the hand. The central role of the dollar is taken over by a fully-fledged international reserve currency, based on the already existing Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)
International Monetary Fund (IMF).

49
50
51
52
53

• A system of fixed exchange rates more help prevent further chaos. A Tobin tax on international financial transactions and thus on hot money also creates more calm (called Robin
Hood tax). With its help we produce extreme poverty and climate against
go.

In a democracy the last word to you. But in important decisions you say less and less

on the European Constitution. They wanted to increase the retirement age, in violation of their election.

There is a large gap between the paper reality of the ministries and the reality of the
people who have to do the work. Because the government does not know the problems of people are wrong
decisions taken. The SP held in recent years large-scale studies on the problems and
solutions of the people on the shop floor. We left tens of thousands of officers, prison staff, teachers,
youth workers, barge skippers and workers in mental health to speak.
The coming years we will continue to explore and do we deal with the solution of people to work.

• We will put a stop to incomes. Administrators in the public and semi-public sector earn

• Representatives lose unnecessary privileges, such as a generous retainer. Paid time jobs for mayors and Queen's Commissioners we prohibit. The fees

52

• The constitutional right of petition is elaborated by law so that citizens get a better grip on the

24

• The administrative complexity in our country we reduce. We make the administration between central and local government
simpler and more democratic. The administrative functions of the water boards we bring to the
provinces. We are investigating how we can make big smaller provinces, so administration regions
become unnecessary. We're going to remove a lot of the cost of the board.

25
26

• The number of external employees of the government is drastically reduced.

• The population of the Netherlands Antilles decide their constitutional future. Netherlands
can only consolidate their debts if they have good governance and sufficient income.

In the past, people always emigrated from the Netherlands, and people from abroad come here to work.
In the last century were immigrant workers brought here by companies that offer cheap labor
sought. The discussion about the problems with the integration of these immigrants has long been declared taboo.
Attempts by the SP to engage in this debate, clashed for years with resistance from mainly other left parties.
The debate on the integration thus fell into the hands of right-wing parties.

18
19
20
21
22
23

Integration comes from two sides. Migrants must open themselves to the values ​​and culture of the
society where they belong now. For them the same rights and obligations as everyone.
And society should allow a proper integration. By no subordinate and crack down on
action against discrimination. And by creating good conditions for education, housing and employment. Where we
were born, we stand there together to build our country again.

Freedom of religion is not a license to exclude people. Freedom of speech does not justify

Cohabitation is speaking the same language, live together, go to school together and work together. Politicians have
I looked away for too long and neighborhoods abandoned to their fate. The report shared future. Propose

Our suggestions

39

• We put up a barrier against segregation and ghettoization and work on joint engagements and
mixed schools. We give everyone a fair chance to fit in.

40
41
42

• Schools will provide municipalities with mixed education and make a plan for that school. With
better information to parents about the school choice, a fixed login time for children and maximizing parental contributions. Where possible, we work with double waiting lists for students
and without delay.

43
44
45
46
47

• Districts are mixed, young and old, native and nonnative, rich and poor. Through Housing
municipalities get more opportunities to mix neighborhoods.

48
49
50

• Market forces in the integration we stop and the proposed market in the adult we do not even start. Integration must be customized, close to home, in the neighborhood. The
Education Inspectorate monitors the quality. People over 55 do not have to join the
integration, but it will be offered to them.

51
52
53
54

13

• We advocate in the European context to reintroduce work permits for Eastern European workers. We enable companies responsible for housing, language training and education of workers. Who evades the CLA, is tackled hard. The labor inspectorates in Europe more closely together, to deal with subcontractors.

5
6
7

• Combating discrimination in the labor market given high priority. The Labour gets
ability to investigate reports of (age) discrimination and to penalize offenders.

8

• We do not accept that officials refuse to marry people of the same sex.

10
11
12
13

• The unemployment rate among immigrants, particularly among young people, we deal with. Failure in the secondary vocational education and vocational training are contested by intensive support. Students who need to get have
practical lessons.

15

• We purchased it for marriage and family migrants mandatory integration test abroad off.

20
21
22

• Asylum seekers should be collected where possible in its own region. In the Netherlands they have always
the right to a humane shelter. Asylum seekers should be detained under any circumstances in detention centers
if there is no valid reason. Asylum seekers should not be seen as criminals and hence
not be treated as such. Asylum seekers do not belong in tents and may just work.
A common European asylum policy must not result in a worse treatment of refugees.

23
24
25
26

• Asylum seekers who must return not to be refugees. Failed asylum seekers
keep right to shelter as long as they are actively preparing their return. Municipalities
have the right to provide emergency shelter. The State thus ensures financial resources.

27
28

30

• Victims of trafficking have the right to a permanent residence permit and get maximum protection, if they are willing to testify against those who have traded them. Human trafficking is hard fought.

31

• The Netherlands will adhere strictly to the International Convention on Children's Rights. Temporary custody should only view is a quick expansion - and never in children. Build children

In times of economic uncertainty, people need social security. When people work
and lose income, the government must protect jobs and maintain income. We need small
entrepreneurs and self-employed by the crisis and help young people and migrants at work
hold. We want to prevent children growing up in poverty. We help people get out of debt and
find that people who do work do not come around.

We can not blame it on the people who have built our country, the price of the crisis. It simply
Increasing the retirement age is absurd and unnecessary. Let people under 65 first orbit
give and keep working. We launch a new offensive against poverty. The crisis threatens
number of double arm in the Netherlands. We can not let that happen. Right now it is hard solidarity
required.

In the discussion about raising the retirement age be told many fairy tales. Politicians create anxiety
images in order to make the spirits ripe for deterioration of our pension. Increase in
Retirement age, unwanted, unnecessary and absurd, we show that the state pension be payable in the future. And
many people after the age of 65 may not work longer. Moreover, it appears that increasing the
Pension age no solution to the crisis. What does help, is to ensure that older people who can and
want to work to get the job.

The minimum wage for young people from 18 years increased and eventually aligned with the adult
minimum.

30
31
32
33

• The retirement age remains 65 years and early retirement remains possible. People do have the right to post
their 65th by working with the same rights and obligations as other workers. We need people
and 65 into work and keep working.

34
35
36
37

• We will put a stop to top incomes. Administrators in the public and semi-public sector earn more than the Prime Minister. We support the efforts of trade unions to all workers

43
44
45
46

• People with temporary contracts and agency staff we provide greater security. They have been right
on a permanent contract. To combat abuses comes a permit for temporary employment agencies. Even people with temporary contracts be entitled to severance pay.

47
48
49
50

• We are examining how we self-employed (freelancers) that conduct work in their sector
mainly done as an employee can bring to social security. For example by
the principal covered by a collective agreement to allow pay pension and disability contributions.

to work are pay gaps addressed and there will be more opportunities to work and
Combining care for both mothers and fathers.

We attach great importance to our health and are willing to invest in it. Investing in a house
doctor around the corner and a care center in the neighborhood. In nursing homes that our elderly a decent old
day delivery and a youth which our children a future. People with low education life
an average of six to seven years less than people with higher education. We do not want division, with proper care

The introduction of market forces, hospitals will no longer be held accountable for the care

The market in mental health should stop. So say 5,000 employees, in
the research that we did dislocated in the mental health care. Market forces will lead to unnecessary competition between
healthcare providers and insurers and hopeless bureaucracy for caregivers. Market forces clashes with the
inspiration from people and is fatal for their motivation. Caregivers want to get rid of the manager culture,
where they are judged by numbers. They want more space for their own professionalism, to people in

Our suggestions

• We invest more in health care and the free market in healthcare is halted and reversed over time.
Profit distributions to investors namely lead to perverse incentives in the health care and ways
we off. The premiums for health insurance are income dependent. The bureaucratic system
diagnosis treatment combinations (DBC) will disappear and be replaced by the free price
funding on the basis of the number of patients and the intensity of the necessary care. Working in
promoting employment. New providers must first meet quality standards.

• Of scale we go to scaling in care. We choose as much care as possible
nearby, with community health centers, dispensaries and health centers. We also offer home care
as much as possible at the community level, as well as nursing, care and daytime activities.

37

• For Creep sure we go against. Priority will be given in care for other than medical reasons is not allowed.

46
47
48

• The nominal premium for the health insurance is significantly reduced. We introduce a means-tested
health insurance premium. Incomes up to about the minimum income be exempted here. The care allowance is then unnecessary. The excess is eliminated.

49
50
51
52

• We improve the EMEA to undress in his stead. We're going to transform the care service packages
better forms of payment, based on demand for care, staffing and environment requirements.

Many people are happy about many others. Yet our society has become tougher. People
are becoming less and less able to solve together problems. We do therefore increasingly relying on
the police. Which should act as others fail. Then we must be willing to invest more in our
agents. More police on the streets leads to more security in the area. More community police officers and district stations can

The workload of agents is too large, the bureaucracy continues to grow and working conditions are bad. That
reflected in our report The officer spoke, a survey of 10,000 police officers. Many agents are
still judged on the number of vouchers they distribute, need to work with poor computer and com
tions equipment and may be insufficiently present in the neighborhood. Agents are worried about the
society. Over the growing aggression and the number of young people derailed. But also on the increase

• We invest in additional 1500 police officers. Those particularly at home on the street and do not belong behind a desk.
The computer systems in which agents have to work with to be adapted to the needs of the
agents. Agents are no longer judged by the number of coupons that they unsubscribe.
35
36
37
38
• With small police posts in the area we bring the police closer to home. Community police officers we put
no longer for other police duties. Their place is in the neighborhood. Police let us not indulge in private security. That is bad for the police and for safety.
39
40
41
42
• We will start a campaign to recruit more volunteers for the fire department. Firefighters gain
greater participation in improving their work and their education.
43

45
• Attacks on police officers, firefighters and other public aid workers is being addressed particularly hard, with heavy penalties and fines.
46
47
48
• There is sufficient capacity within the police and the prosecution to all returns pending
to take. Anonymous declaration to be possible.
49
50
51
• Police and Public Prosecution should keep victims informed how does their thing. Victims receive assistance in the recovery of their damages from the offender. Imposed by a court damages be paid by the government, which then collects the money from the offender.

• For complex issues such as child pornography, cyber crime, environmental crime, trafficking and sexual offenses
must at police, prosecution and judges get more knowledge and expertise. Pimp Boys are
harshly, it was done as not reporting crimes - for example, because the victim did not dare this - perpetrators must be identified and prosecuted.

disturbed prisoners belong to a secure psychiatric hospital. Get ex-offenders
better guidance on their return to society. The bureaucracy at the probation we go
considerably attacked.

• The Internet is a new source of income for many criminals. Much needs to be more actively acted against all forms of cybercrime. Illegal gambling via the Internet should be better
contested.

• The Dutch Data Protection Authority gets more sanctions and fines should be higher

Investing in better education, to focus on the knowledge economy. The politicians have simply talking about. But on
dertussen we are behind the rest of Europe. We have too many decorated our education to the whims of
called education experts. And not enough to the needs of pupils and students and the knowledge
of teachers. We appreciate the interest of the student and the student-centered and provide education
back to the teacher and the teacher. We do not cut corners, but investing in education.

Better education requires better teachers and thus better training. The requirements should higher, the professional
knowledge wider. Vocational education should train for a profession where you really make a difference. Universities and high
Schools should not leather factories where you have to figure it all but themselves. Personal begelei

After years of educational reform is the teacher come out stake. Whether it's the second
phase, VMBO, the scale of 'Back to school together'; the stakeholders were not consulted.
In the report, the teacher of the word shows that teachers ideally know how to improve. The courses
should be better, the classes must be smaller and the bureaucracy curtailed. But most of the power needs
of managers and governors be curtailed. Teachers want to get back control in the classroom.

Our suggestions

• We will invest more in education. And ensure that the available resources also to education
go and not to overhead. That means more time teaching and less time wasted on bureaucracy and rule drift. School managers hear from now to give myself lessons.
38
39
40
41
• Educational proved too often education destruction. Major education reforms never be
more on the minds of pupils, students and teachers made.
42
43
44
• Good education requires qualified teachers. So hear unqualified teachers in two years to get their powers. Teachers salaries we set nationwide fixed. Gradually comes to every primary school
additional support, for example through a school janitor.
45
46
47
48
• For students with a disorder or disability should be available special education. Money for
Students care is given to their guidance. The so-called 'appropriate education' is a cut and therefore the table.
49
50

• The purchase of schoolbooks no longer via tender. Schools and teachers have the right to their
to choose their own textbooks.

• Scaling often turning out bad. Schools are leather factories, with little personal relationships
and much bureaucracy. Mergers between schools, we will severely test and schools are given the opportunity of a
According to them too large school board to switch. We encourage construction of small schools.

• Everyone learns under 23 years of work. Without basic qualifications nobody should leave school.
For young people who, because of limitations no basic qualification can get get plenty of opportunity for one - on their specific talents - training, track work or daily activities. Failure in secondary and vocational education we tackle by intensive support.
9
10
11
12
• Pupils in secondary schools should be able to smoothly flow. Barriers to "stacking" (from VMBO to HAVO and VWO) we clean up. And students who are helped thereby, provide
we practice education.
13
14
15
• The final level of MBO is set centrally and there are national examinations. Therewith
we are introducing competency-based education in MBO unnecessary.
16

18
• Functional illiteracy we tackle better. Thus we help a lot of people who often have problems to get along in society.
19
20
21
22
23
24
• We're not going to fiddle with the student and the basic grant. To improve accessibility for students from families with low income we raise the supplementary grant. A new
feudalism we do not need, because pupils and students have no interest in that. The
Tuition may rise up with general inflation. We do not do variable tuition fees.
And MBO get a free public transport card.

• Sponsorship and advertising do not belong in schools. Older Contributions must be a maximum
bound and everyone should know that payment is not compulsory but voluntary.

schools have a duty to accept.

We live with many people on a small piece of earth. That space should we use smart, for living and

The Netherlands has a fine tradition of public housing, for everyone to have a decent and affordable home
offer. In a pleasant area, with ample amenities. That achievement is thrown up for grabs. The
housing associations are market driven, whereby they demolish houses cheap and expensive homes
build. The housing associations must again build the homes that people need.

The report Along the slooplat. Five conditions for the demolition of affordable rental housing, we propose
demands on the demolition of houses. We only demolish homes that are demonstrably wrong and prevent

demolition of their own home.

• Quality of life must remain the possibility to build housing in the smaller centers. There
is an approach to shrinking regions and small towns. Even in parts of the Netherlands where the population
shrinks, quality of life must be guaranteed. Services must be as close as possible around
remain, from primary school to municipal service, from home care to retail affiliate, post, ATM and
bookmobile. Of retailers and banks that make lots of money in densely populated areas, we ask
to offer also on the sparsely populated countryside reasonable facilities.

• In areas where excessive shrinkage occurs, the government jumps in order to allow the necessary restructuring.

• Instead of building new offices, we can better first over 8 million m2 of vacant office space filling. Outdated business we could do with a facelift again attractive to entrepreneurs.

The politics has less and less to say about public transport. The transport companies are verzelfstan

Protect what is vulnerable, it is a question of civilization. Nearly 380,000 children are growing up in
poverty. Every year, nearly 50,000 young people in education. We have the task of our children
give fair chance at a good future. Therefore, we help families with a lower income. And worries

People with physical, mental or psychological disabilities should be able to participate fully

Almost nowhere is the failure of politics as clearly as in youth. Billions are spent on
managers, bureaucracy and agencies working at cross purposes. Resulting in broken homes,
parents and children without a future. In the report, the social worker to the word that the workload
far too high; employees are drowning in paperwork and social workers have too little time for the
children. Youth Aid workers want more control over their own work and less control from above.
Also, they do not want competition in the youth.

Children
• Child benefit is income dependent and void for families with the highest incomes.

39
40
41

• Child must be affordable and of good quality. For children with special
social or medical indication should be guaranteed good care. Parents go for second
and the next child (ren) himself to his ability to contribute more to childcare.

42
43
44
45

• From low-threshold centers nearby parents are supported in education, and assistance is
care provided and if needed directly referred for specialist help.

46
47
48

• There will be an ongoing campaign against child abuse. There will be more treatment places for
children who are victims of child abuse.

49
50
51

• Obesity in children we are going to reduce. Advertising of unhealthy foods aimed at children
is forbidden to twelve years. Vending machines we exclude from schools. Educating
parents we improve.

without basic qualifications are plenty of opportunities to get an education.

5

• Unemployment among migrant children requires extra attention. Failure in the secondary vocational education and vocational education is challenged by intensive support. Students who need to get have
practical lessons. Discrimination in the labor market, we do not accept.

• Everyone learns under 23 years of work. Without basic qualifications nobody should leave school.
Failure in secondary and vocational education we tackle by intensive support.

12

• Children under 27 years get back right to assistance.

14
15
16
17
18

• There will be more places in the youth so that young people no longer have to wait for the necessary assistance. The incarceration of juveniles in care, we will avoid. We want Multiple Dwellings
and foster homes and places for young homeless people. We invest more in prevention,
so that we can prevent problems. Youth care goes where possible to the municipalities.

19
20
21

• The market will be reversed in mental health services for young people. Youth Emergency workers
more time for contact with children and families.

22
23
24

• There will be more youth workers and more facilities for young people in the area, such as community centers and
skateparks. We do not want 'mosquito's (beep boxes) to scare away young people.

25

27
28

• Many adoptive parents put their heart and soul to their children. In general, however, it is
better for children as they grow up in their original environment. Adoption of foreign
children should not be unlimited. The government closely monitors whether there is a child abduction, child trafficking or corruption.

accessible. The accessibility of public spaces and buildings will be improved
people with disabilities.
• The zakgeld- and clothing allowance scheme is extended

40
41
42
43

• The government and large corporations need to take more people with a disability or partial disability in employment and organizing appropriate internships. Therefore we create a legal
scheme.

44
45

• Government Web sites and services, we make it more accessible for people with disabilities.

We not only provide an economic crisis. In time, also threatens a climate crisis.
Our environment is threatened and the sea level will rise, which could have major implications for our low country. The
future shortage of fossil fuels could lead to global conflicts. Reason enough for a firm
to implement climate policy, with an emphasis on energy conservation and renewable energy and food. And on
investing in a sustainable economy and a green tax.

It is a big mistake that drivers have sold our big energy companies to foreign on

gas production.

(2050) formulated. We will assist developing countries a strong hand in setting up a
good climate.

35
36
37
38
39

• The energy companies for the long term is equivalent to that for consumers.

40
41

• Gasunie Engineering - which Shell and Esso receive 50 percent of the proceeds from the gas - is
undone. Money thus released is put into an investment fund for renewable
energy.

42
43
44
45

• We get our energy back. Therefore we encourage municipalities alone or jointly
want to establish a sustainable municipal or regional energy company.

46
47
48

• The allowances in emissions trading in CO2 we will decrease gradually. We stop free
giving away allowances.

49
50
51

• Before we move on to the underground storage of CO2 should be examined its effects better. Rather than doing expensive and uncertain investments in storing CO2 we can better
investing to reduce CO2 emissions.

• We are promoting energy-efficient construction, transportation and manufacturing, utilization of waste heat from
power plants and industry and other energy-saving technologies, and the expansion of renewable electricity and gas. Coal, oil and nuclear power plants should be replaced by solar,
wind and other renewable energy. A wider subsidy for solar panels.

• In a Climate we take measures for a sustainable energy supply. The subsidy for
renewable energy is limited to techniques that are still in development, such as solar power.
Wind, biomass and other techniques that are nearly mature, there will be a mandatory share
sustainable production of energy suppliers.

• We strive for the strongest possible greening of the tax system environmentally friendly
produce is promoted and polluting production is taxed more heavily.

19
20
21
22
23

• We must be careful with the use of raw materials. Producer responsibility
is tackled for waste generation and packaging. The illegal trade in waste through
Netherlands we tackle by maintaining strict in ports and to monitor the waste brokers. In a European context we set conditions for the responsible handling of our waste.

24
25

• The control and punishment of illegal discharges at sea gets a higher priority.

26
27

• The transport of hazardous substances must be reduced to a minimum. Municipalities must draw on the knowledge of the transport of dangerous substances and contingency plans. They should
population adequately inform.

30

33

• To avoid bureaucracy there will be one national inspectorate which monitors the environment,
working conditions, health and spatial planning. The enforcers have a broad mandate and endurance power.

34

• There will be better rules for protection against soil pollution. There will be a national plan
asbestos inventory and remove.

37
38
39
40
41

• Intensive livestock farming in the Netherlands is responsible for 14 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason alone, the livestock will have to be reduced. We encourage combined heat and power plants use CO2 to gardeners. Emissions, we also counteract by promoting
sustainable agriculture and shorter transport distances.

42

51

• More than 95 percent of the 450 million farm animals living in the farming industry. Reduce farming

In a healthy society, we work to live - and not vice versa. After our work we want a fun
nice way to relax. And have ample opportunity to develop our creativity. That requires

sufficient affordable facilities for sports and entertainment, and opportunities to become involved in art and

culture. And it requires a rigorous containment of the ever-expanding leisure and culture market, which

everything of value is a commodity and the thickness of the wallet is what determines who can afford it.


16

In times of crisis, the culture is often the first victim. But it is precisely in times of crisis can art and culture

signal new hope and creativity. A creative society challenges everyone to stay away from themselves

develop. That can in libraries and museums, in music and brass bands, in choirs and drama clubs, on

music venues, workshops in the visual arts and other small centers. The media are a source of far
making, but also of information and confrontation of ideas. For a free and democratic society

it is important that the media are not entirely dependent on the commerce. The government therefore helps

to protect freedom of information.

Who does not know his history, is ill-equipped for the future. Especially in a country where the dichotomy

• Dutch musicians should get a fair chance to make music to earn a living.
Concert Visitors should be legally protected against pushing up the prices of tickets
for concerts and events.

• The government must take measures in consultation with artists and performers for subsidies
and support .. Professional artists should be given a fair chance to work with their own one
earn decent income.

45
46
47
48

• Libraries are not just knowledge, but also meeting places for the residents of neighborhoods and
villages. They therefore deserve continued support from the government.

49
50
51

• Music schools and marching bands, choirs and drama clubs, music venues, art workshops and other small-scale creative centers are the basis for a broad cultural life. The government recognizes its
responsibility for keeping alive the cultural life and offering support where necessary.

39

defines only a part of the transmission time. There will be a separate set of guidelines.

17
18
19

• Newspapers are under pressure. Further concentration leads to impoverishment of news and opinion. The
government must endeavor to keep the independent regional press upright.

20
21
22

• To also our cultural heritage and knowledge for the future to preserve digital should be used
open standards.

23

25
26
27

• The Internet is a vital infrastructure that is supposed to be accessible for everyone. It is the task of the
to promote the government. Citizens must not be closed because of downloading. In the international context, proposals are made to establish the omnipotence of some giant corporations with ties.
Use of open standards can help to keep the Internet open to everyone.

People all over the world visit each other more and more and increasingly work together. To combat
poverty and disasters. In the fight against pollution and a better environment. To combat conflicts

The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan proved fatal mistakes which our government seriously failed and not
listened to the people. That must never happen again. That is why we need NATO - which remains a

• Each deployment of Dutch troops will be followed by a thorough parliamentary evaluation,
beginning in Afghanistan. Because the Davids Commission can not answer all the questions, a parliamentary inquiry into the invasion of Iraq remains necessary.

46

• We will refrain from purchasing JSF fighter.

has been considered a veteran. Veteran Care we will legislate so good
aftercare for the long term is guaranteed.

Take the lead in an international ban on investment in these weapons. Partly by
deployment of the SP has been an international ban on cluster munitions.

13
14
15
16

• Brussels should be cheaper. During the negotiations on the contribution of the Netherlands to the European Union
we aim to reduce this contribution. The unnecessary circulation of European subsidies must
stop. The proliferation of agencies should be limited and the bureaucracy curtailed.

17
18
19

• Netherlands expresses its veto on the next long-term budget of the European Union when
Member States are not thereby required to justify their European subsidies.

20

• Brussels to interfere in our education, our health care, housing, social security and
public transport we want.

23

26

• In Europe, competition arose which led to ever lower taxes on corporate profits.
Better cooperation should lead to large businesses countries are not played off against each other and pay decent taxes.

27

29

• Poor countries should be helped to develop a decent tax system. Multinationals
must now also pay enough tax in those countries.

• The Netherlands should not be engaged in a battle group of the European Union.

32

• The new strategic concept of NATO should be submitted to parliament so that the

• The Netherlands is investing in crisis prevention, peace building and human rights protection. To this end,
grant us land granted to local and international non-governmental organizations that focus
on perception, protection of human rights and silent diplomacy.

10
11
12
13

• The total budget for development cooperation we maintain at 0.8 percent GDP, especially now that the crisis
poor countries will find so hard. That help has to be a lot more effective and transparent. Aid should be at
benefit the poorest people in the world. Waste of help we vigorously oppose.

14
15
16
17

• At least 85 percent of development aid should be spent in the developing countries themselves.
Direct support for the state budget is risky. Improper expenditures from the aid budget, such as the
debt forgiveness that will never be paid off, should be discontinued.

18
19
20
21

• More important than development cooperation is that developing countries have fair chances
the global market. The World Trade Organization should focus less on free trade and much more
fair trade. Netherlands and the EU must - even if the WTO negotiations remain stuck to abolish export subsidies in the European agricultural policy by 2013. Further restrictions
of agricultural subsidies is desirable to begin the subsidies that animal cruelty, overfishing and

• Israel has the right to secure and recognized borders, the Palestinians are also entitled to their own
state, also with recognized and secure borders. When the Palestinian Authority to the United Nations
calls for recognition of an independent Palestinian state, The Netherlands should support this request.
Netherlands insists on implementation of previous Security Council resolutions and international law. The Netherlands is committed to an international dialogue with all representatives of the Palestinians. If Israel continues to illegally build homes in occupied territory
should insist Netherlands in the EU on the suspension of the Association Agreement that Israel gives tax benefits to export to the EU countries.

Netherlands in late 2008 in the deepest recession since World War II ended. In 2009, the eco
economy by as much as four percent. From this year the economy seems again very carefully from a deep valley at
climbing. However, this recovery is still very fragile. As a result of the deep recession, the tax
Government revenue decreased dramatically. Public spending rose sharply, for example,
because the number of unemployment benefits has increased. The surplus in the government budget
0.7 percent of GDP in 2008 has turned into a substantial deficit of 6.3 percent of GDP is expected in 2010. on
changed policy enhances this to around 2.9 percent of GDP in 2015. In the longer term, however, also threaten higher
costs resulting from an aging population and more expensive care.

It is not realistic nor wise to this hole in one cabinet period of four years to fully seal
at. If we cut down so many at one time, the chances of a double dip - a new recession - large. Given
the size of the deficit is a progressive reduction of the deficit over the next 10 to 15 years more
the hand. We want the economy does not kapotbezuinigen whether the recovery in the bud break. If the economic
recovery stalls or does not continue, we will not hesitate to temporize our plans. We want the crisis
do not shift to the municipalities, because cuts have a direct impact on the citizens there. A Gede
tail learned financial support is available as a separate appendix to this election.

Our suggestions

38

• Fiscal policy must take into account the strength of the economic recovery. If this restoration is not or not enough throughput have to be delayed too large cuts, in order to prevent
that the recovery in the bud is broken. It should be looked at height and the well
composition of the growth.

• With sufficient recovery must be through spending cuts and tax increases in the budget deficit
the end of the next government's term to be reduced below 2 percent.

46

• Substantial savings are possible on defense spending and spending on external parties by central government and local governments. The bureaucracy in healthcare, education and government and
through better use of ICT resources. However, the coming years billions needed
for improving the public sector and reduce poverty.

• The retirement age remains 65 years. This is financed by a progressive reduction of the mortgage interest deduction. The proceeds of these stores until well after the next cabinet down. But the reverse is also true for the higher costs to maintain the retirement age at 65 years.

• In addition to cutbacks, the government can obtain billions of euros more revenue through higher taxes on
higher incomes, assets and profits. There will be an asset and a capital gains tax.
Also, environmental taxes can be increased.
• The highest rate of income tax will be increased from 52 to 55 percent. There will be a new
top rate of 65 percent from a taxable income of 150,000 euros.
• Deductions are across the board limited, so the government receives more revenue. The
tax rates themselves do therefore limited to be increased. The progressiveness of us
tax result rises sharply.
• The tax on earnings above € 200,000 will be increased from 25.5 percent to 30 percent. Those of
20 percent remains unchanged. At the same time the interest deduction is limited to 30 percent of the gross operating income, to discourage buyout funds. This limitation does not apply to small businesses.
• There will be a penalty charge for Dutch companies that locate in tax havens. They have to
henceforth disclose in their annual report how much tax they pay in the Netherlands. Netherlands stops
uncritically concluding tax treaties with tax havens. Netherlands can take the initiative
for an independent international expertise to tackle tax competition.
• The mortgage interest is guaranteed a mortgage loan of up to 350,000 euros, against
42 percent deduction. This limitation is gradually - over a period of 10 years - in. The deductibility of pension contributions is capped at one and a half times the average income. The repayment of mortgage debt is
encouraged.
• The nominal premium for the health insurance is significantly reduced. We introduce a means-tested
health insurance premium. Incomes up to about the minimum income be exempted here. The care allowance is then unnecessary. The excess is eliminated.
• To make work pay for people with minimum wage or just above, for these
groups of people entered an earned income tax credit.
