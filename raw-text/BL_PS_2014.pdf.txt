INTRODUCTION
Over the last five years, our country has gone through one of the worst crises
its history. First, the financial crisis of 2008, caused by
unscrupulous speculators who sought only the short-term profit, had
dramatic consequences on the economy and employment in our country.
On the other hand, the desire of some to break the country has led to a very
long political crisis.
Despite these extremely difficult circumstances, the PS took
responsibilities, based on the broad mandate that was granted to him by the
citizens in 2009 and 2010. In Wallonia, Brussels and the federal government, we
ruled with the same ambition: to stabilize the country and revive the economy
and employment, to exit as quickly from this crisis, protect the most vulnerable
and resume as soon as possible with a prosperity that benefits all.
Its commitments, the PS held them, despite immense difficulties. The country is
now stabilized, public finances are under control, Regions
strengthened have the means to stimulate the economy and support employment.
Yet much remains to be done. We must first ensure that stability is
maintained, for those who sought to undo the state and solidarity do not
renounced their goals. And because the right continues to advocate
solutions to the crisis are to be paid in the cost per workers,
pensioners and benefit recipients. The PS, he will work to boost
economic recovery that is shaping and ensure that it benefits everyone.
Growth that would only benefit owners of large estates would,
for us, without interest.
In 2015, the PS will celebrate its 130 years of existence. In 130 years, that of conquest
obtained at: universal suffrage, social security (reimbursement of care
health, pensions, sickness and disability insurance, paid leave allowance
unemployment ...), automatic wage indexation, voting rights for foreigners
right to die in dignity, abortion rights, marriage rights for
same sex ... The legislature has now ending, despite the
very difficult circumstances, enabled the realization of many advances that
stood at the heart Socialists: price reduction of over 2,500
medicines and hospital costs, cap the salaries of bosses
public enterprises, control of electricity prices, the best contribution
capital, drastic reform of the banking sector, the increase in pensions
lower, elimination of school fees for scholarship students
higher education, adoption of a recovery plan, reform
the monarchy, social and environmental clauses in public procurement,
competitive clusters and reregistering Marshall Plan in Wallonia
growth momentum, activation of the guarantee and the New Deal for Young
Brussels ... Clearly, the presence of the Government made the PS
difference.
Is everything rosy? Obviously not. The economic crisis has caused
business closures in our country, in Wallonia, Brussels and
Flanders, resulting in tens of thousands of job losses. More than anything
Another, the PS is aware of the social impact and human suffering
21

engendered by the current economic situation for workers and
their families.
The election issue of May 25, 2014 is: to give the necessary weight to PS
to allow to reap the benefit of new learning all
citizens, to give hope to everyone, and to oppose
conservatism and isolationism. Social circumstances and
economic, such as the need to maintain stability of the country, call
wide mobilization around the PS project. This popular support is
needed for that evening of May 25, the balance of power between parties
political, between left and right, is such as to enable the PS to be
present in governments and work to improve the lot of
workers.
PS The program details the measures it proposes to the legislature 20142019. It accurately describes a project clearly anchored company
left, justice and solidarity, a coherent project of Europe to Regions
through the Federal State and the Communities. Its implementation depends
directly of the election results. In our parliamentary democracy
proportional, political logic is simple: the higher the PS will be strong plus
measures included in its program find to apply. Plus
PS will be weakened, the more revenue the right and nationalists will
win.
Stimulate
Belgium has fared better than other states to the effects of the crisis. This
resistance is due in particular to the powerful protection offered by our
social model. But these good results are also related to the balance
rigorous management of public finances and recovery devices
the economy. Through the struggles of the PS, Belgium has not blindly followed
neoliberal pathways supported by the European Commission which advocated a
Austerity diehard and undermined solidarity mechanisms. Both the State
Federal (with its recovery plan) and Wallonia (the Marshall Plan 2.vert)
and Brussels (the New Deal) to have acted contrary to support the
economic recovery, because we know that the support of authorities
Public is necessary for economic vitality. For the PS, it is a
obvious: we must intensify the economic recovery in the five
coming years.
Economic development and the creation of quality jobs are
heart of the PS project. Both in Wallonia and Brussels, companies that create
employment, investing in research and the products and services
future, which act in the real economy must be supported by
authorities. Our companies must innovate to provide products and
high added value, in economic terms as in terms
social. This is to enhance the potential of our territory and women
men who inhabit it.
In the eyes of the PS, prosperity is beneficial when it creates jobs and
it enjoys sufficiently to the community. Growth for the
sole purpose of profit is obviously not that supports the PS because it does
22

can only lead to a dual society where only a few wealthy and privileged
enjoy the efforts of all. The PS therefore supports companies that create
employment, training their workers and pay attention to their quality
of life, in the commercial sector and the nonprofit sector.
In this context, various economic sectors will have to be

many opportunities for businesses to create jobs and activity
Economic. These challenges also give them the opportunity to become more
efficient consuming less natural resources.
Both in Wallonia and Brussels, the PS intends to pursue efforts
undertaken in recent years to support a territorial development
Service of social welfare. This is, again, to use the potential of our
territories and resources to amplify the economic redeployment
our Regions. Territorial development is based on areas
metropolitan and urban (the city and its hinterland), as well as on
rurality.
Empowering
Historically, the PS has made personal emancipation the foundation and purpose
his ultimate action because emancipation through education, culture and sport
a necessary condition for the happiness and fulfillment of being
human.
The school is a place of emancipation par excellence. It is she who provides each
the key to understanding the world of vocational integration and
citizen. It allows each child, each youth to acquire the knowledge,
life skills and expertise necessary for its integration into society
today. Therefore, for the PS, the school must be able to play its full
role of social mobility. The school must pursue the goal of forming, at
throughout life, responsible citizens, critical and open to the world. She must
provide skills that will afford everyone
emancipate and develop the professional and personal. He imports
also redefine the school's aims, to make force to its mission
emancipation and social justice, and to provide educational teams
suitable tools. The PS proposes that adopted with the world of actors
education a "Pact for Education", also involving some
aspects the forces Walloon and Brussels, following a wide
consultation to identify ways to achieve the ambitious goals
23

improving the efficiency of our education system and reducing
social inequalities.
The recent reform of the higher education landscape led by
Socialist further improves its accessibility by ensuring close
Geographical same time it facilitates the mobility of students in the
continuing their studies. Now it is necessary to undertake a reform of
funding of higher education that will guarantee the quality of our
education, democratic access and will fight against failure.
Similarly, culture is a source of individual emancipation and
collective wealth. Universal access to culture remains a fundamental challenge for
progressives. Technological developments, especially, lead to
need to strengthen the mechanisms that allow everyone, regardless
income, level of education or where they live, to access practical
and cultural works.
In recent years, the PS led and won many battles
terms of individual freedoms. The PS will defend his victories and fight
so that advanced harvested for abortion rights or law
Dying with dignity does not regress to the resurgence of positions
conservative. The Socialists want to continue on this path and
conquer new ethical progress so that every citizen has, in
Belgium, the full freedom to choose his life.
Number of laws, often adopted on the initiative of PS, allowed
to achieve equal rights. It is our responsibility to tirelessly continue
our fight against all forms of discrimination that still exist
in laws and realize this equality on the ground, including
making citizens aware of their rights and integrating a course
citizenship in the school curriculum.
Equality also demands to allow persons with disabilities
full inclusion in society, ensuring their active participation in
all facets of community life and by arranging the environment that is
theirs in a logic of universal accessibility.
Finally, the society model defended by PS advocates harmonious relations
between cultures, based on intensive exchange and focused on one mode
integration that does not seek to abolish the differences. Social inclusion of
newcomers through seamless integration to society, their
ability to develop a sense of belonging and acting as
full citizens, the quality of reception, integration into a medium
life, access to adequate housing and socio-emotional environment
adequate.
Protect
Progress conquered by the PS and its allies are union and mutualist without
continually challenged by the right (north and south of the country). A
effective social protection, the fruit of several socialist fighting
decades arouses jealousy because it counteracts grabbing thirst
24

some: so for supporters would like to see each of the demolished
Solidarity organized for the benefit of all. For the PS, social security is a
common heritage that can not be questioned. To those who would like to
undermine the PS answer is clear and unequivocal: we will not touch
to social security. Rather, in the coming years, Social Security
and social cohesion should be strengthened to cover better yet
needs of those who face the vagaries of life, to ensure
each and a decent pension to reflect changes in society.
For the PS, health is vital. Our health care system is one of
best in the world. It is often cited as an example in other countries. These
recent years it has been improved by the action of socialist ministers. TO
the future, our health care system needs to be further improved in
taking into account in particular the lengthening of life expectancy and
it entails consequences on the organization of health care.
The PS is the party that defends the employment of workers. Faced with certain
bosses of multinationals, acting without scruple or consideration, have
cure the impact of their decisions on the workers, the PS opposes measures
protecting them. In the future, public aid must be more
conditioned to job goals. For the PS, so does business
as citizens: the rights must be accompanied by duties. In addition,
social dialogue which guarantees closely defined employment policy
relationship with the social partners, must remain the basis of our model
socioeconomic. This tradition of consultation ensures, more than any other
instrument, social peace, essential factor for prosperity.
Citizens must also be protected from abuse merchants and service providers
services. People's interest we saw how many were considered
Accessories by those who seek profit at any cost. Think of the banks
who invested in toxic financial products or those producer
ready meals incorporating food unrelated indications
on packaging. There are countless examples and unacceptable abuse.
In banking, food security, insurance, financial products,
etc., many measures have been adopted to protect the
consumer; others must be, in particular by the Union
European.
The PS also intends to support the purchasing power by strengthening the
price controls, the defense of the automatic wage indexation and
the alleviation of labor taxes. The citizen must also have
easy access, including financially, housing, energy,
transport. This is essential for a decent living in our society: power
shelter, heating, lighting, moving up conditions
fundamental individual happiness. If we do not act strongly, soaring
housing prices and the cost of the energy bill undermine
realization of the right to housing and the right to energy, yet recognized
as cardinals rights. Significant efforts on the part of authorities
Public will therefore bring in the coming years on building
Massive public and private housing, the possibility for everyone to become

transport or access to public transport quality.
In the same vein, the departments of authority must place the
citizen at the center of their concerns. An inclusive society presupposes
First public tranquility. Live safely undeniably participates in
individual well-being. Prevention, repression, repair must together form
the response of the State for violations of the persons and property. There
Justice, for its part, must guarantee the litigant understandable service
financially accessible, centered on the victim.
The protection of citizens as intended by the PS also aims to realize the
solidarity, to accompany the weakest, most precarious or
the less affluent. The Socialists, pegged to the body, never worry
leave anyone by the wayside.
Tax reform
Taxes are necessary to fund public services provided to
citizens in key areas such as health care,
education, public transport or aid to businesses. However,
Today, taxation applicable in Belgium weighs too heavily on the
worker. Between 2011 and 2014, the trend has started to reverse, through
the action of socialist ministers in Government: no less than 7.5 billion
EUR efforts have been charged to the capital and banks (5.4 billion)
or come from the fight against tax fraud (2.1 billion). It is necessary
continue in this direction. For PS, a tax reform is essential
to switch the labor taxation center of gravity towards the
capital. It must be accompanied by a struggle without thank you against all
forms of fraud in that they threaten our model of solidarity and
justice, both social and fiscal.
The recovery objective of our public finances is about to wear
fruit. Time is not a new budget adventure
lead to burdening the debt interest burden and lead to a
pressure on social security, public services and workers.
Maintain the stability of the country
Faced with persistent claims from some, to split the country,
PS landed rampart to ensure its stabilization. This desire, which
paid off, remains intact.
Belgium has known a long institutional crisis. After 541 days
paralysis, by dint of perseverance and conviction, an institutional agreement
been reached on the initiative of the PS and under the guidance of Elio Di Rupo. This in
Monitoring is an important state reform operating skills transfer
essential to the Regions and Communities. Wallonia sees its autonomy
increased and Brussels is definitely recognized and funded as a Region
own right.

26

For the PS, it is crucial to remember that federalism is not a
evolution undergone. It's a choice ! That of development and the future. This is
the result of a struggle to ensure the rights of Brussels and give
Walloons levers necessary to ensure the development of their region.
This regionalization is acquired and strengthened through thirty years
the continued commitment of the PS, which has enabled Wallonia to tear at
spiral of economic decline. This is the regionalization that has scrambled our
airports, flying our exports, strengthen our attractiveness
International. This is the regionalization that makes our country an asset
our re-industrialization, which enabled the implementation of a policy
dynamic economic. This is the regionalization, always at the initiative of the PS,
allowed the adoption of the future agreement and the Marshall Plan, or a
regional development strategy in permanent evolution that
Wallonia reinstated in positive trends and dynamics

capitalizing on the achievements of the past decade.
It is therefore essential to implement the institutional reform

Regions. Walloon and Brussels, not to mention the German, will have
new instruments they will put the policy ever service
coherent and coordinated.
Building a Europe with a human face
This stabilized Belgium must play a role in the world. Our model
high social protection and permanent dialogue can be exported.
Europe must take a social turn. The neoliberal model promoted by the current
Commission, which we see day after day the limitations (the resounding failure of the
liberalization of certain sectors such as energy, fiscal austerity
blind prevailing social dumping between Member States ...), must give way to
a solidarity model. Europe is one of the best projects of the twentieth
century and a great ambition for the twenty-first century, but today
neoliberal technocracy of the European institutions has taken precedence over the values
solidarity, fraternity and progress brought by the fathers of Europe. For
PS, now up to create a true social Europe.
On the left, resolutely
Throughout the chapters, the following pages will help you make
knowledge of the proposals brought by the PS and the emerging model
society we want. A model of society that carries up our values
justice, solidarity and equality. A model of society which stimulates which
emancipates and protects. A model of society materialized in Regions
strengthened, stabilized country and a social Europe in the face. A model of
company that creates, for each and everyone, the conditions of personal happiness.
If, thanks to the support of voters after the election on May 25, 2014, the PS is
called to participate in government and can weigh heavily on their
orientation, the next five years will continue building this
model of society and to ensure that everyone benefits from the recovery
Economic.
27

EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING
The liberal 2008 crisis and its aftermath have underlined the importance of creating
jobs as a prerequisite to the welfare individual and collective.
More than ever, we must focus our energies to support the
development of creative activities of quality jobs and ensure
provide the best support those who are seeking employment.
Economic development and job creation are therefore the heart
our project, both at European level and at the federal, regional levels,
Community and Local Authorities. For the PS, employment and training
are, together with education and the economy, the basis of prosperity
tomorrow.
The employment policy is unique in that it is defined in Belgium
close relationship with the social partners. Social dialogue must remain
backbone of our socio-economic model. The PS will do everything to preserve this
specificity of social management of our country, guarantor, more than any other
instrument of social peace, essential factor for prosperity.
Beyond that, the role of government is to facilitate the meeting between supply
and demand for jobs with the aim that each can benefit asset
a quality job.
Public support for employment is based in particular on a diverse arsenal of aids

instruments were gradually added to lack consistency. There

a unique opportunity to overhaul and simplify the arsenal aids

Brussels and Walloon regional authorities are endeavoring, from the establishment of
new majorities, to define a new landscape of public support for employment,
coherent and adapted to the realities of each regional situation.
Our party is the collective fulfillment. Prosperity is not until
is the creator of quality jobs and that it benefits all. Growth for the
sole purpose of profit is obviously not that supports the PS because it does
can only lead to a dual society where only a few benefit from affluent
efforts of all. The PS therefore supports those employers who create jobs,
train their workers and give attention to their quality of life. For PS,
public aid should, for this objective to be packed
jobs. This applies both companies and citizens rights must
be accompanied by duties.
The PS believes that special attention should be paid to young
jobseekers. Too often, they are slow before you can prove
their capacities in the workplace, despite many devices
support for the commitment.
We must therefore strengthen this support by filling out the accumulated during training
period of teaching, training and internships, a first

another job. This professional experience will also open it the right to
unemployment benefits in the event that the insertion contract would open
no access to stable employment.
Besides the difficulties encountered by certain public (young people
remote employment, job seekers aged ...) to access a job and
which require targeted responses, one of the major issues of good
functioning of labor market lies in securing career paths
professionals.
Indeed, the discontinuity of career paths tends to grow
significantly due to:
 multiplication of insecure contracts (temporary, fixed-term contracts
determined, part time ...)
 increasing job transitions related activities and
Companies that are created and disappear regularly;
 most frequent and numerous transitions between articles of
employees and independent.
The PS believes that governments must implement
provisions to put the safety and long term in a
changing and uncertain environment. This notably involves:
 strengthening guidance and information on jobs;
 strengthening and improving support for unemployed;
 preservation model and means of retraining units and
permanent platforms retraining;

 a "security training" given to each worker;
 training in occupations in demand and in the occupations of the future;
 facilitating the transition of insecure jobs into jobs
sustainable.
More broadly, the challenge is to put in place social protection
throughout life that enables seamless cross moments

as is the case now, people in precarious contract or time

Our country is characterized by the many neighboring emphasis on

EASIER, BETTER READABILITY AID AND ACCESS

For several years now, governments have considered it useful to
propose an aid package - mostly financial time - to promote
job creation. But it turns out that this approach generated effects
perverse. Thus, some aid, including federal, are now less linked
to job creation as its maintenance: in short, it is more levers
to reduce labor costs as insertion tools.
Moreover, the different levels of power have developed their own systems
aid with little coordination between them and without integrating vision or
complementary. Thus, the effect "lasagna" due to the accumulation of such aid has
30

sometimes developed, generating at best a lack of transparency and therefore a
neglect of certain aids.
Finally, many aid recipients challenge when administrations
are outside the conditions of access for aid because they lack some
days or a few euros to be eligible. Others are surprised that victims
a dismissal when they were helped, they can not benefit from the balance
the advantage which they had access to another employer. This generates in
them a legitimate sense of frustration.
It proves therefore appropriate to take advantage of "employment" greater powers
assigned to the regions as part of the sixth reform of the State to review
all aid to the existing employment and, in these times of scarcity
public resources, define performance aids, efficient, coherent and
available that fit into the reflection of greater efficiency,
notably involving, where it is indicated, local authorities in the
compliance with the subsidiarity principle
In this context, the PS proposes to:


lead, at regional level, in cooperation with the social partners,
a comprehensive inventory of devices transferred to the regions and those
already covered by their skills to improve the
complementarity and effectiveness of economic support measures,
employment and training so that they pursue together and
coherent, shared development goals;



streamlining and simplifying, on this basis, with the social partners,
aid on a limited number of devices with targeted goals
arising from social and economic priorities;



for ineffective measures, as under a windfall or too little
used, continue in extinction context, aid commitments
previous limited in time and plan for sustainable aid, a
mode soft extinction;



fight against threshold effects by providing more
decreasing according to certain criteria;



establish a system portability rights reductions (balance
that remains when a person receiving aid for its implementation at
employment loses his post before the end of the period covered by these
advantages) ;



ensure that any change in the employment assistance devices
does not entail an additional burden for local authorities.

aid

The PS also intends to facilitate access to assistance, both at company level
and workers. The complexity that exists in fact engenders
some perverse effects, the smallest structures or applicants
to the most distant from the labor market jobs not requiring - by
ignorance of their devices and access procedures - aid
which they are entitled.

31

To fight against this, the PS proposes to:


continue efforts to improve information on aid
existing and conditions for access;



ventilate the aid to the commitment of workers 2-3 different profiles
financial benefits and help identify accessible advantage
by a card assigned to each worker specifying how aid Profile
their commitment can provide access;



make access to certain automatic aids and exercise a posteriori
random checks in administrative simplification logic;



study the feasibility of having a single proof for any type
aid.

2.2.

CHOOSE TARGETED AID FOR ALL MAY HAVE THE SAME
CHANCES OF ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT

Many studies suggest that targeting of subsidies on certain
profiles experiencing difficulties in entering the labor market is
a much more effective policy than linear cuts to promote access
in the labor market. The PS has always defended this option, with respect for
Socialists, of intelligent management of public funds in favor of an effect
maximum in the most distressed people on the job market.
Thus, the competitiveness pact in January 2014 has reserved the bulk of resources
devoted to the reduction of labor costs targeted measures, to
low wages on the one hand and to the sectors subject to strong competition
International other.
The PS intends to continue and step up the policy of target
profiles of persons who wish to support access to the labor market and
companies that hire this type of profiles.
More particularly, the proposed PS:


further targeted measures to reduce labor costs
focusing efforts on low and medium wage earners and people
little schooling;



enhance the complementarity between the aid and training;



maintain a financial commitment of young workers,
and for the engagement and retention of older workers in

improve the volume of jobs, training workers and conditions
work. Companies who exercise their responsibility towards society
must be helped. Those, for cons, which do not take their share of
responsibility, those who dismiss as they make profits and lavish

distribute dividends should be sanctioned recovery
aid granted.
This applies both companies and citizens' rights must be accompanied

To ensure that public aid support employment, the PS proposes to:


link public aid and tax benefits to job objectives,
human resources policy, training of workers and
research and development and investment;



package some of reductions in existing contributions
conclusion of sectoral competitiveness agreements including dimensions
investment, research and training;



introduce a collective dimension in the granting of certain aids
employment, both at federal and regional level, conditioning them in
depending on criteria met by the company and not the worker;



organize the suspension - even removing support - and
reimbursement - for businesses that have not met the objectives,
especially businesses that engage in collective redundancies
without being in trouble.

PROVIDE EVERY YOUNG OUT OF TEACHING PATH TO EMPLOYMENT

Our first concern is youth unemployment. It is essential
to further strengthen the support of the young into work, by defining a
coherent set of tools that will systematically, step by step
each of them to find the path to employment.
The PS proposes to take advantage of the introduction of the new "warranty
young "initiated at European level, to complement the public support system
for use.
Concretely, this is, firstly, to ensure a supported
Quick and individualized to each young by regional employment services
to advise effectively in their job search efforts.
If after four months, a youth was unable to land a contract of employment,
an internship or practical training will be offered.
The individual support it enjoys then help the young to
used the knowledge thus acquired.
If, after 18 months, despite internships and training and despite efforts
Job Search judged positively, a young still fails to
get a job, he will be offered a genuine employment contract of one year, the
"Integration contract". The objective of this first experience,
which can take place in the public sector as in the private, is
clearly to respond to repeated criticisms of employers
the lack of experience of young people. Here we will build the devices directly
34

Type "Articles 60 and 61", the results are in terms of insertion
remarkable.
After the integration contract, the public support for employment shall be pursued
through targeted financial aid that will reduce the financial burden
the commitment of the young in another contract. Here we will build on the
traditional instruments help, revisited by each region within the
Newly exercised skills.
Finally, if despite this support and these targeted aid, the young will succeed
not to stabilize professionally, it will benefit from unemployment benefits
and efforts will continue through internships and training.
The responsibility of the authorities towards young people should be clearly
to make every effort so that everyone can rely on the state for
support. Not for two months, not during six months or a year, but to all
stages of the path to employment for whatever duration.
To help each young person to find the way of employment, the PS proposes to:

3.



pay particular attention to the individual monitoring of all young
job seekers right out of studies;



implement the "Warranty young" (see below);



offer an employment contract called "integration contract" for a period of 12
months and the minimum wage sector respecting conditions
youth that recognize three positive evaluations after opening
right to integration allowance.

P S SERVIC ES PROMOTE THE PROXIMITY COMM E TOOLS
INSERTION ON March CHE EMPLOYMENT

Besides the traditional market economy, government support
the development of social economy initiatives and neighborhood services
for individual or collective societal needs.
These services promote the welfare of the population by allowing it
notably to better reconcile private and professional life and, moreover,
meet the growing needs due to the aging of the population.
Whether voucher services, employment development initiatives
in the social purpose local services sector (IDESS) or
Local employment agencies (ALE), they aim to offer quality jobs, not
relocated to the low-skilled, involved in the fight against
moonlighting and economic development of the Region.
The PS therefore wishes to continue to support these services.
However, to ensure a fair and financially sustainable system,
appears to us that these local services need to evolve along three axes
main:
35





we must give greater coherence to these services for now split between
a plurality of devices;
it is to promote the quality of jobs on offer;
for people who want it and through training
adequate, we must make these jobs near a springboard to
better jobs better paid.

3.1.

REACHING TOWARDS INTEGRATED DEVICE SUPPORT LOCAL JOBS

The proximity policy that has been made possible through the partnership between the
Forem, municipalities and CPAS in the "Houses of employment" must be
continued and extended. Indeed, it gives people a better
accessibility to services and a more personalized support. Otherwise,
the regionalization of the FTA device provides the opportunity for regions to work
pursuing a more integrated system of clearly defined objectives. Finally,
operations "distressed neighborhood," to promote integration on the market
the youth employment priority neighborhoods, are also
interesting additions under the new powers transferred
the Regions.
The PS proposes to make local jobs generates jobs
durable quality,:


develop, on the basis of these Houses of employment, an employment center and
Proximity also integrating activities, through partnerships,
local agencies for employment reconfigured, and any other
voluntary organization, public or private initiative, present their
territory;



make these areas of local jobs tools to promote responsible,
notably through a range of tailored training, transition
to other jobs;



to change, through cooperation, where appropriate between several
municipalities and regional support, employment homes so
they can provide, where necessary, services
complete;



redeploy actions "neighborhoods in difficulties" led missions
Regional Employment (MIRE).

3.2.

MODERNISE-SECURITIES SERVICES FOR THE LOCAL EMPLOYMENT
QUALITY

The employment of low-skilled has been widely supported since 2004 by the
service voucher system. This system has provided employment and rights
social to very many people, and proposed an alternative against the
moonlighting in the field of home services. The system is
also appreciated the population by offering more beneficiaries
undeniable in terms of living comfort and conciliation between private life and life
professional.

36

Beyond its undeniable success, however, the mechanism of meeting
difficulties should be able to provide answers. Believe
including the quality of jobs, the weak transition to other
trades and other types of employment contracts or cost of the system for
public finances.
Regionalization looming regional authorities will provide the opportunity to
better adapt the device to the realities of the field and a real integration project
Sustainable workers in quality employment.
The PS proposes therefore to improve the quality of employment in service vouchers
taking inspiration from the social economy currently under model:


set minimum standards in terms of coaching and training
workers;



set a minimum number of hours for time contracts
part by removing the exemption for sector employees
cleaning power of Prester least a third time;



adjust the height of regional support for criteria relating to quality
of available jobs, seniority workers and assignment
profits;



pay particular attention to monitoring compliance with obligations;



reorient the budget training funds "service vouchers" to
Companies that meet defined quality criteria.

The PS has in addition to:


not increase the price of securities services beyond indexation;



ensure that there should be some reflection on the areas of activity of
service vouchers in order to maximize the contribution of these jobs welfare
collective while being careful not to engender competition in respect of
existing sectors;



better articulate the service voucher system with other services
to meet local needs (homemaker, aideménagère, help and home care), in terms of beneficiaries
(book each device to a specific audience) at the level of workers
(give them perspectives that cover all devices
aid to the person, including training).

3.3.

PROMOTING NON-MARCHAND FORT SECTOR, SERVICE COMPANY

The non-profit sector is an important sector of the economy and
represents about 11% of employment in Belgium.
The PS has always considered the non-profit sector as an element
key to its social project. It is particularly through the non-profit that
the ideal of collective well-being is actually distributed. The non-profit sector
also allows, by the proximity profile persons employed, to give
an employment perspective to a number of vulnerable people. The non-profit
37

finally allows, for services rendered and goods that it provides, promote
merchant sector economic activity.
The sector faces many challenges, torn between public means
under pressure and a growing social demand, either at the level of
elderly, children, youth ...
The PS wants these challenges can be overcome without reducing service
rendered to citizens and businesses.
PS proposes to:


support the policies of aid for the promotion of employment (APE) non
merchant, primarily:
o

in areas that promote the availability on the market
Employment and reconciliation of work and private life
such as the home of the child;

o

focusing in areas of important social needs,
such as help for the elderly, assistance to persons
disabilities, youth, youth welfare, health care
Health ...



support, through subsidies, the conversion of insecure jobs into jobs
sustainable;



guarantee the quality of service provision such as employment in the
non-market by ensuring the qualification of workers, including
their continuing training;



continue the policy of administrative simplification by encouraging
logic of unique forms and reports, information and advice
integrated to simplify access to regional and federal aid and ensure
to provide a rapid response to requests from public authorities
non-profit companies;



move towards alignment of the package "Maribel social" level
membership fee reductions in the commercial sector;



anticipate future needs in terms of non-market services;



support the dynamics of innovation and research and development
in non-tradable sectors.

SUPPORTING PEOPLE FALLING TO EMPLOYMENT CPAS

The CPAS has main mission to guarantee the right to social integration
to people who do not have sufficient income and meeting
legal conditions. The CPAS has three instruments to carry out its
Mission: employment, integration income and individualized integration project
social.
Specifically, this integration objective can take many forms: development
employment through the "Article 60" and "61 items" other forms of
making employment (ACTIVA, PTP, SINE, ... FTA) was put on education and training.
38

This work becomes even more important due to the effects of the crisis. The
PS intends to support CPAS in their action to ensure that
many people can be followed in these reintegration efforts.
Moreover, to preserve the capacity of action of the CPAS, the federal, at the initiative
PS, offsets the additional costs arising from the reform of
unemployment benefits and allowances insertion.
To reinforce this policy, the PS believes that the CPAS must retain its
comprehensive approach to the accompaniment of the person and that it must continue
collaborate intensively and reinforced with regional services involved
in coaching and training to promote integration
professional of its beneficiaries. To do this, the proposed PS:


consolidate and develop the capacity of the CPAS to be the lever far



support coaching within the CPAS to be able to benefit
a maximum of people excluded from unemployment by the insertion internship







The level of education is a powerful determinant of access to the market
employment. Thus, in 2012, the unemployment rate is 14.2% among low
school while this rate falls to 4% among highly qualified.
This level of education is not only a filter to access to employment: it is also a
important factor that stimulates economic development. Level
training of workers and impact on productivity, innovation and
research and development, as many levers that increase the
performance of our economy and provide more quality jobs.
Continuing education is in theory a powerful way that allows
limit inequality strengthened during the school year. As evidenced
some foreign experience, particularly in the Scandinavian countries or
Switzerland, the development of skills throughout life is a source of
social progress and promotes economic growth.
However, here, it is clear that access to training,
otherwise, accentuates inequalities often amplified during the period
school, in the sense that it is precisely those who have made the most of study
access to the most current professional life training: only 9%
little education received training over the past 12 months by
the labor force survey while they are 23% among highly
school.
Continuing training is also a way to give people
outputs of the formal education system with a very low background a chance
can be inserted permanently into the labor market. In the field of
Many initiatives exist. We must continue the effort and analyze
the most effective mechanisms to strengthen.
Finally, it should remind companies they also have to
regard to training, a responsibility that they seem to have abandoned
for twenty years. These are nevertheless indispensable actors
in order to offer candidates genuinely useful skills on the market
employment, whether through internships or making tools and provisions
equipment.
4.1.
STRENGTHENING THE ORIENTATION AND INFORMATION JOBS

The actors of the education and training regularly stress
the crucial importance of information and the orientation of a die young
that corresponds to their expectations and aspirations and that is promising future. He is
yet often difficult to choose among the numerous offers and exploded.
A more comprehensive information and allow positive direction
simultaneously to motivate young people by making them more reach the
40

Certificate of higher secondary education, prevent many
school leavers, to increase the effectiveness of our educational system and
devote public resources available to more effective policies.
For all these reasons, the PS intends to make youth orientation axis
important policy it defends.
More specifically, the PS proposes to:


pool, for example through a consortium, the resources of
players active orientation in the fields of education,
training and employment to develop tools and methods
reliable and adapted to different public policy and standards
quality;



organize the subregional level from emploiformation-orientation crossroads and psycho-medical and social centers (PMS) a
coordinated response to the information needs and orientation
concerns all audiences (youth, parents, job seekers,
workers ...);



increase the number of trades-testing device to
jobseekers to test one or more trades in
conditions close to their work-based exercise;



support, particularly for young people and job seekers,
guidance through the "cities of the trades" partnership between tool
education, training, Forem and businesses, opening the
choices in terms of field of study, training and
trades and developing actions discovery trades and
pathways leading to it.

4.2.

PROVIDE EACH WORKER IN COMPANY A "GUARANTEED TRAINING"
Materializing ITS RIGHT TO CONTINUED EDUCATION

For the PS, vocational training should be a law that allows
each person to be a full citizen and contribute to the creation of
wealth. This continuing education throughout life should include measures to
ensure sustainable availability of expertise that support the creation,
business development, installation of foreign investors and therefore
job creation. These skills also allow authorities
Government to offer services (health, education ...) of highest quality,
which will benefit the entire society.
The PS proposes to guarantee every person the right to acquire and
developing knowledge and skills and enhancement and
capitalization them throughout life, from the studies (see section
education) to exit from active life, going through the different
possible stages (Worker whatever the status, full unemployment, partial or
temporary ...).
This guarantee, which requires the mobilization of appropriate resources to
situation of people, must be a shared responsibility between
41

beneficiaries, public authorities, social partners and employers. A
first step has been reached with the legal obligation to grant
all workers, regardless of the function and the type of contract,
annual training day. This is a critical decision on the path
an individual right to training that calls the other development
measures. It is particularly important to remain attentive to support the acquisition and
development of transferable skills on other workstations,
trades and positions to the public interest and the private interest of the
no one.
To make this right, the PS offers, at company level, to:


clarify the elements that should be factored into the calculation of
efforts made by companies in terms of ensuring the training
consistency with similar surveys conducted in countries
neighbors;



ensure proper application of the provision to grant each
worker the benefit of an annual day of training and extend this right
Individual to 3 days in the lens frame fixed between partners
social to devote a minimum of 1.9% of payroll
Training ;



strengthen the training requirements of vulnerable groups benefiting
aid by bringing them to a minimum of five days per year;



encourage companies that invest in training their
workers by introducing a deduction increased to 120%;



offer training packages tailored to the flexible environment
Business (e-learning, blended learning traditional / online training
during periods of economic unemployment ...);



support employers who invest in the initial training
(students, job seekers, young workers) and produce
efforts beyond the recovery obligation above;



condition access to certain public procurement obligations
terms of training;



strengthen the social audit firms in order to have a detailed view of
efforts in training;



create a European label for companies that organize
quality training for workers.

To ensure the monitoring and enhancement of this continued training,
Governments should put in place the devices. For this, the PS
proposes:


expand and diversify methodologies to officially recognize
the skills acquired during working life, so that they
mass produce effects and the validation of skills is
recognized both by public and private employers;



propose a career assessment to workers, initially,
42

aged 40 and older and poorly educated;


offer each citizen a tool (the portfolio of competences)
synthesizing the complete assessment of skills he can report any
Throughout his life, allowing him to manage its assets as part of its
professionnal career ;



encourage the resumption of studies:



o

through better information, guidance and quality
targeted system of exemptions to promote training
qualifying meeting a need on the labor market;

o

by adapting the educational offer (eg,
develop the offer diploma extramural);

simplify access to the education and training supply and increase the
fluidity of course:
o

ensuring better visibility of the offer;

o

by redefining the access thresholds;

o

articulating existing offerings;

o

providing support in the implementation of the course;



prioritize public aid for vocational training
benefit of poorly educated workers, older workers and
curriculum for the acquisition of transferable skills;



further, at European level, the establishment of the system of
mutual recognition of qualifications and skills and
strengthen cooperation between Member States in this context;



seize the opportunity of regionalization of paid educational leave for

BUILDING ON TRAINING JOBS IN DEMAND AND JOBS
FUTURE

In some professions and for certain qualifications, companies are not
no qualified candidates, while Wallonia has significant
labor reserve. Far from the crude caricatures of right, these
shortages result from various factors: they sometimes result conditions
salary or work too unattractive or appropriate training deficit.
The PS believes that it must rely heavily on education and training
to respond to skills gaps ..
Meanwhile, it should be
improve the image of technical trades, scientists and professionals,
give the urge to exercise them. Finally, for some businesses, it is necessary that
Enterprises improve the working conditions they offer.
The work on these issues is already bearing much fruit. From
2005, under the Marshall Plan, the Walloon Government has initiated a
control device against labor shortages accompanied levers

important to invest in vocational training, trade by trade,
job seekers.
Furthermore, Forem published in October 2013, an analysis on trades

training to better understand the future needs of employers and adapt
now their training provision.
The establishment of training facilities to meet these

companies.
PS proposes to:


further objectification of labor shortages, identification

jobseekers ;



constitute a dashboard state by regularly skills
available among the population of job seekers, those in
under construction in the education and training system and
skills demanded by employers in order to anticipate more
the necessary training adaptations;



continue the work skills adaptation produced by
education and training systems and those requested by the
businesses and supplement this with a major policy work



involve businesses and professional sectors more
through sectoral agreements to act on the attractiveness of trades

contracts ...);



deepen synergies between Wallonia, Brussels and the Federation
Wallonia-Brussels in preparing for careers and future

participates fully in the device;



encourage studies repeatedly to form trades in shortage

enroll in these courses, students funding criteria;



establishing a European stock device to allow
support young people who are studying or training in
future occupations defined by the European Union and associated with innovation and
research and development ;



the range of possibilities open to both girls and boys for
various sectors.

The PS also proposes to ensure the continuation and development of the
inter-regional mobility, in particular by optimizing the exchange of offers
employment and the development of language training.

GUARANTEE JOB APPLICANTS AND THE MOST REMOTE
MARKET ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT TRAINING TOOLS
4.4.1. Sustain and expand the "youth guarantee"

The "youth guarantee" is an initiative of the European Council largely
defended by the PS in Europe, which aims to ensure that, in all states
members, within 4 months of leaving school or loss
job, any young person under 25 is way to propose either a job offer
quality or additional training or an apprenticeship or internship
in company. In Europe, 8 billion euros are planned for 20142015, which will account for Wallonia and Brussels sum of
120 million euros (80 million and 40 million European funding
Regional co-financing).
In 2014 and 2015, Europe will co-finance measures implemented in this
framework for regions with the youth unemployment rate exceeds 25%, ie,
for Wallonia, the provinces of Liège and Hainaut.
Specifically, at European level, the PS proposes to:


perpetuate the mechanism of "youth guarantee" at European level,
wear the maximum age for care to 30 years and increase the means
devoted to it;



ensure the involvement of social partners in the development and
implementation of the "youth guarantee" in all European countries;



better coordination of existing funding sources at
Europe such as the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Bank
European Investment Bank (EIB) to develop projects
Common oriented SMEs investing in job creation
for
the
young people
especially
(development



finance the "youth guarantee" apart from other supportive policies
training and employment so that this initiative will lead to a real
increased resources devoted to the fight against unemployment
Europe;



strengthen, through a "European Charter for internships," the
European legal framework to ensure a common quality standard
high youth regarding the quality of learning,
internships and training, salary levels, conditions
work or access to employment services;



fight against internships and temporary contracts or fixed term
successively proposed and therefore abused youth by developing
a binding European framework and developing the European Charter
for internships;



encourage the establishment of a European framework for training
alternating both for secondary education and
higher education based on the best European practices
in this domain ;
45



facilitate the transition between the school world and the world of work
through the promotion of learning and placement, as well as the
development of joint study programs involving both
teachers and businesses / industries;



adopt a European legal framework to ensure a standard
common quality for organizing the monitoring of young asylum
employment, so as to minimize the discrimination between
countries.

In Wallonia, young people under 25 years account for 22.5% of
jobseekers. For the PS, you should keep youth
get stuck in unemployment at the end of their studies. We must construct with
young a real journey to employment. Also, special attention should be
given to the implementation of the "youth guarantee" at the regional level, to
assessing the results and sustainability of the system once the
efficacy findings are present.
PS proposes to:


enable young people to have or a job or internship, or at least
additional training through capacity-ready devices
for use with which the "youth guarantee";



continue the momentum through the "youth guarantee" in
mobilizing all socio-economic and political players with a
biennial commitment of the social partners to release a
number of training places;



continue adapting the support process for employment and
training in communication patterns of young people concerned (use
favorite channels, centers of interest ...);



set up a system of sponsorship of young asylum
Job by volunteers experienced workers to encourage
their transition to employment;


widespread use of tools for identifying skills and,
Specifically, identification of potential young together;



continue the development of training in basic skills and
life skills;



continue to strengthen ties with the company and with the school;



intensify partnerships for grip and the return on the market
the employment of young unemployed and without a degree (called "NEETs"
not in education, employment or training).

4.4.2. Investing in alternating training centers
skills, advanced technology centers and cities of
business
Alternating training provides skills for party
school or training center, partly enterprise,
alternating times and training locations.
This formula has proven its educational value and more present, where it is
practiced intensively, undeniable effects on development
Economic and employment. Thus, in our German neighbors, it is
as seen by the young as by companies, as a way
of excellence for training. The massive government investment
German, but mostly the private sector (chambers of commerce) in
Alternating training future workers is explained largely by
the positive impact that the result on the performance of German industry.
But the alternation, to be effective, pedagogically, assumes that there
a real interaction between training institutions and enterprises.
For the PS, work and training should be recognized at home as well,
as a sector of excellence. It must enable young people to acquire the
technical, social and labor necessary to insert
directly on the labor market.
For the PS, the rapid implementation of reform will be an alternation
priority of the next Parliament. Indeed, the multiplication of contracts and
Statutes of young alternately create a competition between young people and
between operators, but it also induces a complexity and a lack of
transparency for employers, especially SMEs, which affects the device
and pushes some to "do their market" to the detriment of training
young ... An important milestone has been reached through a
harmonization of young alternately status in Social Security. He
should continue this reform also harmonizing the status of
young alternately in terms of labor law.
To strengthen the role of alternation, the PS proposes to:


implement the OFFA (Office of Francophone training
alternating), in joint management, which will be responsible for:

Competence centers have been initiated by the PS with the dual purpose of:
 support investments in efficient equipment and advanced
technology for the benefit of training and education throughout
of life ;
 streamline these investments so that they can benefit as
number, address (or anticipate) the skills needs of
businesses.
Competence centers are high-value training centers,
equipped with high-level technology platforms and energized by a
effective partnership between Wallonia, Forem, IFAPME, social partners
professional sectors, the world of research and universities.
Multi-user training centers, they extend their training to
job seekers, companies and their workers, teachers and
trainers and pupils and students throughout the Walloon territory.

the adaptation of firms and their (future) workers and to changes

Finally, they are also a particularly interesting instrument but also
too little used as such, youth outreach dynamics

To strengthen the competence centers, the PS proposes to:
 review, based on the results of the audit initiated by the Forem, criteria and
procedures for labeling and subsidizing centers
proficiency with the following objectives:
o eliminate competition between centers;
o sustain and strengthen support by sectoral funds managed by
professional and labor sectors;
o further amplify the opening competence centers

to

o boost the involvement of centers of competence in

 further strengthen the links between the centers of competence centers

Advanced technology centers are educational structures,

job seekers and workers, through skills training

the food industry and green industries.
In terms of employment policy, the PS proposes to:


strengthen synergies between centers of excellence and centers

rationalization and not competition;



4.4.3. Enhance training for job seekers
The unemployed must be harnessed to improve the skills of

time spent unemployed is to be used for training and, if
appropriate, occupational retraining. In this respect, the calculations should be

PS proposes to:


provide, without delay, the new job seeker, a 'box

interlocutors of the available vocational rehabilitation;



adapt to advantage the type of training and monitoring
removal of an applicant for employment in the labor market;

o prevent these courses become, for some, access to a
cheap labor for not proposing a

Workers in place;
o ensure that each trainee is informed of his rights.
4.4.4. Support, training, the most remote people
employment for reintegration
The socio-professional integration centers (PSTC) is a sector
association that offers training called "pre-qualifying" or socializing
in very diverse sectors. Their role in the socio-professional integration is
therefore essential for the very public away from the labor market.
This sector has been widely supported and its missions have been clearly redefined.
The PS will continue to support these key players because they can
implement this commitment which is dear to give a chance to each and
to work all together to build such holder virtuous circle of growth
and jobs.
The PS proposes to strengthen the pre-qualifying training focusing both
on trainees as the necessary synergies between all operators
active in the field of socio-professional integration and employment:


strengthening the implementation of pathways and bridges, especially to
validation of skills, skills training and industry
the interim;



encouraging the participation of ICPC in the fight against shortages
labor and awareness / training for occupations of the future;



favoring consultation with sector representatives to better
adapt the structures and regulations specific to public
away from employment and improve the social and professional integration
these public.

Illiteracy continues today at a rate of 10% of the population. This
unacceptable situation is incompatible with the democratic functioning
our society, as in terms of equal opportunities.
In recent years, governments have devoted increasing
means to literacy. Meanwhile, the priority was to better coordinate
the action of the various levels of power in literacy at
, notably through an annual ministerial conference.
The challenge now is to better align investments in
literacy programs to the real needs of those concerned.
Alongside the integration programs for accessing training
or employment, literacy is a vector of social cohesion.
In addition, governments are increasingly being confronted with
development demands of the French language. Poor mastery
the French language, which is observed in people of all backgrounds participate
Also this stall that distances people from the labor market and
against which we must fight through appropriate solutions.
To do this, the proposed PS:

5.



strengthen the provision of literacy and mastery of
French language, with particular attention to the public which
not within the socio-professional integration but integration
social;



develop literacy and mastery of programs

training in some sectoral programs;



CCROITRE A NUMBER OF EMPLOYMENT QUALITY S

The focus of many actors (experts, media, politicians ...) on
rates of (un) employment and unemployment has the perverse effect of obscuring the debate
on well-being at work and quality employment.
For the PS, it is essential that the debate on employment pays attention
equal to the number of jobs and their quality. The models of society where the
Unemployment is very present but where insecurity is higher than
observed among us is not the model that we defend. For this
Because we have always refused the logic of German mini-jobs: offer
51

jobs to 450 euros a month to reduce the unemployment rate is not a
social progress but is instead a step backwards.
Also, the PS attaches great importance to the wage level questions,
Stability of employment, conciliation between private life and professional life
yet health and safety in the workplace.
5.1.

ENSURING THE LEVEL OF WAGES

Salary is an important component of the quality of employment,
particularly for workers at the bottom of the scale of
remunerations. It is also an essential element that determines the
purchasing power of households whose development contributes to the health sector
Economic turned to the domestic market. Finally, the pay can also be
seen as a factor of recognition and appreciation of the work.
PS proposes to:


reject any violation of the principle of automatic wage indexation
(see Chapter consumer);



raise the net income of workers primarily targeting low and
income means, converting to "gain pocket" part of
deductions at source;



continue to gradually increase the tax bonus for employment
low wages ;



maintaining freedom for the social partners to negotiate
wage growth in the context of the implementation of the 1996 Act
competitiveness, taking into account wage subsidies in the calculation of
the wage gap with neighboring countries;



begin debate on the wage pressure in enterprises in
publishing annually in the remuneration report the difference between the
the lowest wage and the highest in the company, given that,
for social economy enterprises, Wallonia, on the initiative of the PS,
already limited, by decree, the wage pressure at the most 4 times salary
down;



joint committees operate optimally
taking better account of economic and social reality, including
setting up a binding nomination procedure of
Joint Commission prevents some companies to engage in a
shopping between the joint committees, in search of the least
expensive;



analyze the methods of calculation and award allocation guarantee
income in order to make employment, even part-time, more attractive than the
unemployment;



implement the obligation for employers to provide priority to
workers who benefit from an income guarantee allowance
most important work schedule during recruitment.

5.2.

FACILITATE THE TRANSITION TO PRECARIOUS JOBS SUSTAINABLE JOBS

For a variety of workers, job insecurity is still a problem
importantly preventing them from fully realize their life projects. Thus,
In 2012, 27% of the jobs are part-time jobs and 40% of these
workers report that part-time is suffered because of the market
work. In addition, 315,000 workers are employed on fixed-term, including
70,000 in the interim sector.
We must work to facilitate the transition of these people into employment
stable and full-time.
PS proposes to:


ensure that the CTC which plans to give priority to workers
split times of the company in case of full-time commitment is
respected;



pay particular attention to the issue of overtime
and, specifically, provide support to companies processing
overtime in additional jobs;



focus aids whose magnitude gradually decreases in the
time in order to avoid as far as possible, that their brutal suppression
encourages turnover of staff;



include measures to encourage employers to favor the conclusion
full time contracts (not given if the structural reduction
worker is hired at least half-time; modulate cuts
depending on the part of the partial time in the business ...);



encourage, by the terms of public financial support for employment (EPAs
service vouchers, ... PTP), the transition to full-time employment
durable;



prohibit daily contracts, unless specifically provided for exemptions
by the social partners and except in cases carrying the agreement of the
union delegation;



match up the contract and duration of
appeal on the grounds of the interim;



provide for a fixed period before the termination declaration of intent
collective, period during which the dismissed temporary
benefit from similar redundancy terms to those of other
workers.

5.3.

COMBATING THE USE TRAPS

For some, access to employment means an income loss
available. This paradoxical situation is explained by several factors,
often combine: too unattractive wages, rising costs (custody
children, travel ...), benefits losses.

53

This is unacceptable since it hinders the accession
Human labor law.
The most effective way is of course to increase the net income of low wage.
It is a recurring objective for the PS, which obtained in the different material
success through the raising of social and fiscal bonus or the
raising the minimum wage. Other tools, however, can be mobilized
to fight against unemployment traps.
PS proposes to:


continuing support for the increase in net wages for the lowest
through bonuses to employment and tax credits;



extend for a limited period, some related benefits
unemployed status when the transition to employment is accompanied
a low wage;



promote the availability of and access to small infrastructure
childhood (cf. early childhood program).

5.4.

WORKING FOR GENDER EQUALITY IN THE LABOUR MARKET

Wage gaps between men and women are still too
important in our country and are obviously totally unacceptable,
although they tend to decrease slightly from the past
years. The wage gap between women and men rises, according to the latest
report by the Institute for the equality of women and men (2013 report,
Statistics 2010), 23% on an annual average. Average hourly,
the difference is 10%. The difference between the wage gap in time and that in
year is mainly due the uneven distribution of working hours. This gap
is especially important in the private sector, especially among employees. From
Moreover, the gaps do not mark only the salary but also on
fringe benefits granted to workers.
To fight against this discrimination, the PS proposes to:


adopt the implementing decrees necessary for the practical implementation of the
legislation to fight against the pay gap between women and men;



give the inspection of social laws the means to fight against the
discrimination contravening CTC 25 on equal pay
between male and female workers;



insert in the Belgian Code on Corporate Governance relative component
the fight against discrimination between women and men;



force
the
employers
to
inform
systematically

Workers (Artists) salary consequences in terms of career
pension choices they (they) want to do;



increase and adapt supply to the level of non-formal and Home
crèches, nurseries including companies or between companies.

5.5.

RECONCILING BETTER PRIVACY AND PROFESSIONAL LIFE

An effective employment policy is also a policy that ensures
better articulation between private life and professional life, allowing
the working time while maintaining the purchasing power
important.
It is also ensuring that women often brought to organize their time
work for family reasons, the opportunity to have a career
complete and safeguard their pension rights.
In the previous legislature, the individual time reduction systems
ordinary work were streamlined in the general idea of ​​a possibility
reduction up to one year full-time equivalent.
Concerning leave, concretely, the PS proposes to:


perform a prospective evaluation of the effects of recent reform
conducted over the term of careers, particularly women;



continue reform in the field of thematic leave, ensuring
the right balance between reconciling private and professional life and
with attention to women's rights to full careers;



significantly increase the possibilities of collective childcare
(see Chapter Childhood);



enhance regional policy favoring the creation

Voluntary reduction of working time can, in some circumstances,
be an instrument to boost business by enabling,
simultaneously, improve the quality of work for workers, increase
the volume of employment and increase business productivity, allowing
to maintain their competitiveness. The SP maintains its structural objective
collective reduction in working time in consultation with partners
social. This also helps to reduce gender inequalities in the
the labor market (particularly to limit involuntary part time
the women).
Both devices support the voluntary and collective reduction of
Work currently exist in Belgium: a reduction of weekly hours
working less than 38 hours and four-day week. These devices,
supported by public authorities through a payroll tax reduction
however little used.
PS proposes to:


support and strengthen voluntary forms and negotiated reduction



increase support to companies that are experimenting

The quality of employment through the physical safety of workers

Professional which they are exposed. Regulation should also
provide that in case of accident, the worker receives a fair compensation and

In this regard, the PS proposes to:


improve the protection of workers' health and safety,
Especially workers in atypical situations (eg
part-time) or in subcontracting activities including:
o

redirect external prevention services to companies

o

strengthen control (inspection) on these forms of

REVIEW

DIRECTIVE
WORKERS

EUROPEAN

RELATIVE

TO

DETACHMENT

OF

The free movement of workers is one of the foundations of the Union
European (EU). Directive 96/71 / EC contains a set of rules
Mandatory relating to the working conditions of a posted worker in a
another Member State.
The basic principle of the directive is simple: if a Member State provides for
minimum working conditions, they should also apply to
workers posted to that State.
However, the Directive has shortcomings that explain the
it intends to conduct combat (in principle, at least)
are seen on the ground and grow.
Reform demands of the directive are regularly claimed,
particularly by the Socialist group in the European Parliament or by the unions.
None of these requests has so far been successful.
At most, a directive of interpretation of basic law is currently
under discussion between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council. This
project, adopted by the Council in early December 2013, and which contains one or
the other advanced obtained through the relentlessness of the Belgian Socialist delegation,
will soon be discussed in the European Parliament. The Socialist group
Parliament, however, refused to agree to this text, considering it
responded too little to reform demands needed to protect
workers ..
Given the magnitude of the adverse effects that the Directive leads on the field,
namely the serious employment of Belgian workers and the future of our
enterprises but also the exploitation of foreign workers often disarmed
address the unacceptable practices of some companies, the PS believes that
ongoing reform is only one step and proposes a profound reform
of the European directive for an end to social dumping.
As part of a revision of the EU Directive governing the
posting of workers within the European Union, the PS proposes to:


safeguard the right of workers to the negotiation and action
collective;



limit in time the detachment and justify the change of scenery
(reimbursement of costs ...);



adopt a list of cumulative criteria that determines whether a worker is
seconded or not (place of business, place of recruitment, applicable laws
to workers compared to those of application to customers, share of
contracts of the company in the country of origin ...)



fully implement the collective agreements of the host country (and
not only the mandatory components of the national legislation);

57



give Member States the means to achieve effective controls;



a presumption that the regular place of work is that of the State
Home, for application by the company to provide evidence to the contrary;



set up a European coordination of inspection services,
accompanied by real and dissuasive sanctions;



provide for the payment of social security contributions in the country of origin
worker is calculated based on the rate of the host country and on the basis of
salary actually received.

Furthermore, at European level, the fight against social dumping will be facilitated
by the struggle against wage competition between the EU member countries by
through the introduction of a European minimum wage.
6.2.

FIGHT AGAINST NATIONAL ABUSE AND SOCIAL DUMPING

The fight against abuse and social dumping also requires measures and
actions decided at national level. In line with the anti-dumping plan, adopted by the Federal Government in November 2013 under the
active pressure of Socialist Ministers, the PS wants to continue this struggle,
regardless of the fate of the record at European level.
In order to fight against abuse and extend the fight against social dumping
Nationally, the PS proposes to:


provide protection for victims of trafficking in human beings
economic exploitation, such as issuing a
temporary work permit;



fight against the false part-time and independent false;



strengthen inspection services by allocating the resources to their
focus on the fight against undeclared work and against fraud,
detachment of workers' control, and cross-border areas
of subcontracting including through participation in these services,
that is to say, avoiding the non-replacement in case of departure;



fight against undeclared work;



to ensure effective access to justice for workers and treat
files without delay;



operate fully at the national level, the new rules

social dumping in case of use of outsourcing;



make mandatory in public procurement of the prior declaration
subcontractors and limit to one the number of subcontracting levels,
except for some strictly justified.

IN

CAS

OF

Recent years have been very difficult times for workers.
During this period, a series of major international groups announced
massive restructuring or outright plant closures in
Belgium. There have plunged thousands of families into uncertainty
about their future and forced entire regions to think about retraining
their productive fabric.
For the PS, these dramatic situations call for strong responses. The
Companies that have chosen the dismissal must take
responsibilities to families affected by the announcement brutal loss
their next jobs. They can not also ignore their duty
towards the full brunt territories affected by the effects entailed the
events, territories which have often supported them when it came to the
help develop. If necessary, governments may force these
companies to assume the consequences of their decisions.
PS proposes to:


strengthen Renault law, the right to alert that is exercised in the form
a right for workers' representatives to demand
information on the economic and financial situation of their company
to prevent up restructuring and regrouping in
the same procedure of successive announcements of layoffs;



preserving model and average cell conversion and
permanent platforms retraining;



relax the criteria for access to European Fund for Adjustment

different labor markets in member countries;



guarantee to people in temporary and fixed-term contracts,
licensed in a context of economic unemployment, access to the device
conversion even in the absence of collective redundancies;



establish a fund covering compulsory intervention
the employer in terms of outplacement and redeployment if





CONTINUE ADVANCING THE LABOUR LAW

The issue of harmonization of labor-employee statuses experienced
major change in the legislature that ends with the removal of the day
deficiency and harmonization of notice periods. However, other elements
discrimination persist and it will be up to the legislator, in close consultation
with the social partners, to continue the evolution of labor law.
For the PS, we must put an end to all differences that still exist
currently in the status of workers and employees. This difference
indeed reveals totally anachronistic in our current labor market. The
same obligations apply to all workers, whether they are workers or
employees. It is therefore essential that all workers also benefit
the same social rights. This harmonization must be achieved by
increased attachment between companies, by minimizing the cost to
social security and for the state.
PS proposes to:


terminate, within a reasonable time, with unlimited exceptions (workers
construction) on notice under the 2013 Act
Reform-workers employed status, because these exceptions are contrary to
full harmonization of notice periods and can be seen
as a new illegitimate discrimination;



increase notice that violate the Charter immediately
European Social;



authorize the negotiation of sector supplements that cover a
longer than the period of notice;



erase the current differences in holiday pay in
privileging the current mode of calculation of the workers;



harmonize the calculation of the guaranteed salary in case of illness, while
ensuring the right to a month's salary for every sick workers;



reform the landscape of joint committees to remove
differences between joint committees and workers
joint commission employees.

Moreover, it is in society's interest as foreign citizens
legal residence that they can be economically active and thus avoid
to be a burden on their families or the state. It is also of interest
Employers who perform the procedures in order to hire a
foreign worker which is the required profile to be able to put
Working quickly, without depend on a sometimes tedious procedure and
uncertain, especially at renewal of work permits and
residence permit linked to it.
60

For these reasons, the proposed PS:


adapt the conditions of issuance of work permits to all B
foreign national, whatever their nationality, who fulfills the
conditions on the labor market test and the conditions of
work referred to in a contract before it can be issued a
B permit (see also Chapter immigration).

In some areas where the offers are rarer, one can have towards
job seekers the same level of requirements in jurisdictions where
more opportunities exist. We must therefore ensure that regulations
is adapted to local conditions in the labor market;

61

People who are furthest from the labor market are most
often less educated people in precarious situations. For
these people, the system is not suitable and is transformed into a spiral
hopelessness and exclusion, resulting in total stall more precarious.
In the circumstances of this crisis and job shortages, this
accumulation of formalities may legitimately lead to discouragement and
thus lead to the exclusion of persons who have repeatedly proved their
motivation. The system has become overly bureaucratic or
Kafkaesque.
The next transfer of control of the availability of the unemployed to the Regions
should be an opportunity to review the device in the direction of an approach
custom which allow better account of real efforts
provided by job seekers given their characteristics and
the situation of the labor market.
To remedy this situation, the PS proposes to:

RIGHTS TO IMPROVE INTEGRATION AND ALLOWANCES UNEMPLOYMENT

The economic crisis has accelerated a process of growth forms
precarious jobs. The appearance and development of the interim contracts
part-time, fixed-term contracts have precarious work,
especially among the less educated among the workers.
Today, unemployment in terms of regulation and integration allowance
does not take sufficient account of these forms of work: the beacon that guides
Regulation remains the full-time job over a long period. Only
people who have had the chance to get a long enough contract and
full time, or those who come close, have access to unemployment insurance.
This is unfair for people tossed between a range
precarious jobs and, once unemployed, receive too little
rights. The PS wants to change the rules to take account of
the reality of the labor market. This development will also demonstrate that the
society alongside people who are struggling to find steady employment
a society where this type of job is too uncommon.
Moreover, many people who, although the active status,
never had access to employment. Far from stereotypes, among them, one
is in the majority of job seekers anxious to get a contract
work and make numerous efforts to achieve this goal. The PS
also intends to be with all people, young or
youth, who make every effort to fit in the labor market. We
appears in this regard that more reward research efforts

especially in certain regions.
PS proposes to:


continue raising all minima allowances



renegotiate the terms of access and retention allowances insertion

more flexible, offering few opportunities for full-time contracts and

ECONOMY
An economy at the service of employment for the Walloons and Brussels, that
summary in a formula the objective pursued by the PS. In other words, the PS
said yes to an economy that creates jobs and invests in the real, yes to
economy that innovates and that values ​​talent, yes to an economy that is a
growth equitably distributed, yes to an economy that allows each
the fruits of his work and to live in dignity!
For the PS, economic activity and creation of quality jobs so go
together: there is no redistribution of wealth as possible without creating value
by enterprises. Therefore, any business, SME, SOHO, large company, should
be supported in its development. To this end, it is up to
Governments create a climate conducive to the emergence and growth of
entrepreneurial projects.
Priority to SMEs and independent. These favorable conditions
economic development of our business, both in Wallonia and Brussels,
must primarily benefit SMEs - first job givers in
our economic landscape - and independent. The Marshall Plan in Wallonia
and the New Deal in Brussels working in this direction, stimulating an undeniable
positive dynamics of economic restructuring. The effort in both our
Regions must be continued and intensified.
At the forefront, facilitating access to credit for
SMEs and the self. If significant progress has been made in
During the parliamentary term now ending, such as banking reform, the law of
SME financing or loans-citizens, we must now ensure
they produce their practical impact for entrepreneurs and mobilize
more resources for the real economy. It should also continue
work to facilitate access to credit for SMEs and independent,
whatever their stage of development, whatever their size.
For their part, public authorities and operators that depend on (such by
such as public financial tools) must engage in a
improving services to entrepreneurs. In this regard, the SP finds
that their role should be strengthened so that they are fully effective in
economic redeployment in favor of the promoters.
Similarly, the social status of self must be extended in order to grant
optimal coverage. Introduce more solidarity and justice between tax
the self-employed will fund new benefits
social security, particularly in terms of pension, incapacity or disability
work. This solidarity and fair taxation will also result
the review of social contributions reduction opportunities smaller
independent and especially young people who start.
Competitive enterprises, respected workers. The competitiveness of a
business depends on many factors: it varies by sector of activity
the company, its size or level of development. According to the PS, the
public authorities have the task of using various levers to promote
business competitiveness, by affecting the cost of energy (often heavy
65

for our companies), the quality of the labor force (by teaching
quality and training tailored to the workplace), the employment aid
(necessary for the recruitment of new workers), taxation (through
targeted reduction of employers' contributions), support for innovation or the
Administrative simplification (sometimes to unnecessary harassment).
Competitiveness must not impair the worker's income: this would
a serious error which might harm primarily the firms themselves.
Indeed, reducing the worker's purchasing power would inevitably result
a reduction in household consumption at the expense of companies.
By cons, alleviating the cost of unskilled labor, in favor of companies, must
be carefully considered. Significant efforts have also been made in
recent years at all levels of government to support employers
and reduce labor costs. Economic policy and employment policy are
intimately intertwined. The PS supports employers who create jobs,
train their workers and give attention to their quality of life. AIDS
public must be targeted and conditioned to job goals (cf.
below).
The projects are conceived of tomorrow today. Wallonia and Brussels are
characterized in recent years by incentive policies for
innovation. The clusters are the most emblematic example.
In the eyes of the PS, foster innovation, in all its forms, is vital to
our economy. Also intend to strongly support initiatives for the
companies to create future products and services. The circular economy
(based on the reuse of raw materials) coupled to a high degree of
creativity, operational excellence and an expansion ambition
International form the basis of the innovative spirit that should animate our
entrepreneurs. The PS wishes to reaffirm its support for this model
industrial development because it generates innovation, added value of
jobs (direct and indirect) and standard radiation beyond our
borders. So is this vitality and future of our economy and,
therefore the employment rate of our regions.
High corporate social responsibility. The PS believes that the role of
the company is central to our society. By itself, the project
entrepreneurial carries values ​​that should not continue for one
the profit objective. The emancipation and solidarity can, for
example, participate in the model defined by the contractor.
This appreciation of the company's social role is especially to find
realized when companies receive public support. With a view to
formalize a mutual commitment between companies and authorities
public, the PS believes that business support systems must be
conditioned to employment, innovation and social welfare. This Contract
business and public authorities and ensures optimal allocation
public resources and significantly increase the employment rate.
The cooperative entrepreneurship is a model that is particularly keen on the heart
PS. Because of their shared history, the Socialists reiterate their support
the ideals that this type of entrepreneurship defends. In recent years,
66

capitalistic excesses engendered by neoliberalism have led to renewed
of interest in these generous ideals particular focus on equality, solidarity,
social justice and democracy. In the future, the SP wants to strengthen
qualitatively the cooperative model in its status, recognition or
even the public support is granted.
Like the unions, the social economy plays a central role
in our economic landscape. It develops such services
near high added social value. The attention that governments him
grant should therefore be strengthened so as to enhance the
recognition and importance of this crucial pillar in the redeployment
Economic Wallonia and Brussels. His expertise in the integration of
job seekers in the labor market is among others a lever
strong job creation should be promoted.
The public procurement legislation was the subject of a recent reform
part of the European Union, under the leadership of the Socialist Group in Parliament
European. The changes in this legislation concern the
well-being of workers and sustainable development. Now inserting
social and environmental clauses in procurement by the authorities
public more easily to assign such contracts to local SMEs. He
therefore up to use this option, in strict compliance with the legislation.
For a new economic boom. By the measures it proposes, PS hears
support and promote a new economic development of our regions,
relying on the talent, expertise and imagination of our entrepreneurs on
respect for our workers, and innovation, added value and quality
services and products of our companies.

MPROVING AC OF THESE S FINANCING COMPANY

During this legislature, the PS has got a deep banking reform, unique
in Europe: the prohibition of speculation for its own account, the frame
all activities on financial products for clients, remuneration
fairer and the prohibition of manipulations on commodity prices
food.
There remains a lot of work for the financial sector to be
again in the service of the real economy. For the PS, the next few years
will be utilized to implement banking reform and
permanently redirect banks to their core business support for SMEs.
Also, if the action of the PS has produced the most advanced banking reform
Europe, which undoubtedly makes the financial system and the Belgian economy
less vulnerable to certain shocks, we must be vigilant and to provide a
evaluation of this reform in order, if necessary, to make corrections
to ensure optimum protection of the investor.
Allow the proper development and sustainable growth of our business
requires access to financing. Two main issues arise
entrepreneurs. Firstly, companies suffer from structural souscapitalisation. Indeed, the weakness of capital generates
costly and uncertain dependence on short-term credit to entrepreneurs
67

granted by banks. We must act at the source of this barrier. Other
hand, companies are hampered in their development by the reluctance of
bank players in the lending short, medium and long terms. In
Furthermore, banks have for some years now disbanded teams
took care of business credit, which has exacerbated the difficulties of
Companies that can not finance itself on the market.
In recent years, the very active role of regional authorities and institutions
that depend enabled to better support entrepreneurs and mitigate the
absences banking world by the introduction of the product including mixte1
and especially by the implementation of anti-crisis measures. But we must go further
considering that the financing of business activity and
Independent is a general interest mission, vital to our growth
Economic.
Therefore, in order to support companies in their development, the PS
proposes a strategy built around two objectives:
 promote increased equity of SMEs and TPE;
 facilitate access to bank credits for all businesses,
craftsmen, traders and independent, regardless of their stage
development and regardless of their size.
Concretely, drawing lessons from the financial crisis, and to achieve these
objectives, the PS wants to change the financial landscape based on three
strategic pillars which together ensure the diversity and quality of supply
financing businesses.
First, the SP wants to continue the reforms initiated to bring the
banks to return to their core business: Healthy collecting deposits and
financing the real economy and businesses in particular. For this, it
will pursue fundamental reforms that have been launched (separation of
activities, remuneration limited control of their loan granting activity
Business) to ensure that the banks are effectively
alongside entrepreneurs. The PS also wants to better define the status of agent
Independent Bank, which is an asset to protect the best
Consumer facing the banks. Indeed, the independence of the agent bank
made him a "buffer" between short-term aggressive strategy of a bank
and long-term than most investors.
Belfius is now a financial institution in which the State is the sole
shareholder by the Federal Participation and Investment. For the
PS, Belfius must remain in the hands of the state in order to change the bank.
Specifically, the PS wants the bank to play a more active role in
developing a range of products and services to support best
SMEs and independent. The public bank will also offer products

The combination product consists of the grant by the SOCAMUT, automatic 75% guarantee on a micro-credit
bank (max. 25,000 euros and a duration of 2 to 10 years) to the attention of a micro-enterprise / a
independent.

68

and services for public authorities and individuals, developing a
model that combines the expectations of the public sector and businesses.
Then the PS wants the public financial tools (regional companies
investment) continue to play their role, complementary to that of
banks, (co) financing (capital, loan guarantee) companies. The objective
PS is to continue the optimization of the three main interventions
financial tools Walloon accentuating their specialization, each in its
areas of expertise:
 Regional Investment Company Wallonia (SRIW) whose role
is to finance the development of Walloon industrial sectors
in promising niche markets at European and world level and
is for large companies;
 Society of the Walloon financing and guarantee small and
medium enterprises (SOWALFIN), whose mission is to fund
SMEs, artisans, self-employed and the professions, or
directly or indirectly through the network Invests
(nearby business tools);
 Walloon participations Company Management (SOGEPA) whose
mission is to provide financing and businesses guidance
changing.
Finally, the PS wants to encourage corporate support for funding
Alternative private investors, both professional (business angels 2
equity3) or citizens (participatory financing and loans citoyens4). It is indeed
desirable to develop a culture of support for our businesses to
promoting local roots, which will have a positive impact on the mind
undertaken in our regions.
This new architecture, based on the complementarity of actors and
sources of financing, with a strong role for the state, should improve
substantially access to business financing in the next
years. For the PS, it is the duty of public authorities to ensure the
sufficiency and quality of corporate finance so that they
can easily carry, create activity and employment.
Regarding the banking sector, the PS proposes to:


evaluate after its implementation, the effectiveness of the new banking law
in terms of its objective of avoiding as much as possible failure
bank and another financial crisis, while protecting
optimally the investor, and take corrective action if
required;



consider the financing of the real economy as a mission
of general interest and define the content and consequences of the latter are
including in terms of penalties for breach;

2

Individual investors wishing to invest in companies, mostly manufacturers who have already
successful.
3
Companies engaged in making risky investments with specified performance targets.
4
The thematic ready-citizen is a cash voucher that allows citizens to invest their savings in
projects of economic or social value (SMEs, schools, kindergartens, nursing homes, etc.)

69



require banks, by reporting the National Bank of
Belgium (NBB) a simplified monthly publication of large positions
of their assets as a percentage of total assets so that the investor
can compare the use that different banks make money
harvested (credits to government, corporate loans in
Belgium / abroad, mortgage loans to individuals, credits
consumption, transfers of funds between countries, etc.);



improve the preparation of contractor's credit demand
upstream by providing them with a document ("checklist")
listing a series of elements to which it must be attentive, in order
to facilitate dialogue between the entrepreneur and the banker and
reduce the requirement of collateral;



promote the (re) development of the local capacity analysis
credit risks for a better knowledge of debtors and
local opportunities;

 require banks to keep a portion of the loan risk
Companies and independent in their care, to encourage them to analyze
concretely the chances of the project rather than only warranties
available;
 promote and protect the status of an independent bank agent in:
o requiring credit institutions to provide monthly in
the agent with a statement of comprehensive portfolio in a format
adequate computer;
o introducing commission arrangements based on long
term;
 require banks to inform, in a document
specifically, contractors on public funding schemes
existing.
In the interests of transparency and improve citizen confidence
to the financial sector, the PS proposes to:


ask the Council of Regency, administrative and supervisory body
the National Bank of Belgium (NBB), especially compound
representatives of the social partners, to discuss periodically
depth on the general architecture of prudential policy
National Bank;



allow semi-annually to the Committee on Finance of the
House of Representatives, to hear the Minister of Finance on the
prudential policy defined by the National Bank.

Regarding Belfius, PS proposes to:
 strengthen its role as leading financial partner of public authorities
the country, particularly in terms of investment financing
long-term (hospitals, schools, kindergartens, public housing, nursing home,
etc.);
70

 strengthen its service offering to individuals taking account of their
real needs;
 be an active partner and facilitator for independent SMEs
for the funding of their activities;
 strengthen the forms of co-financing with regional tools

 develop an active policy of support for access to housing (credit
mortgage);
 develop a range of consumer loans meet high
ethical standards, with particular attention to prevention
indebtedness;
 developing a modern organizational model encouraging form
ethics and entrepreneurship conscious of the social responsibility of
bank in the implementation of the business plan.
To meet the needs of Walloon companies, the PS offers
strengthen synergies between the regional financial tools and specialize
more.
For this purpose, the proposed PS:
 develop the unique and interactive portal (www.infos-entreprises.be) to
Business Service for quick referral recent
to the right person, depending on their needs: financing,
innovation, consulting, bonuses, grants, permits, subsidies for expansion,
export or transmission;
 bring together regional tools support and financing
companies on a single place of installation in order to achieve more
visibility and operational efficiency for enterprises and
enable economies of scale by pooling
shared services;
 improve the transfer of information on the opportunities and needs

private stakeholders (investors);
 mandate the Strategic Committee, which brings together the Walloon Minister

C RRSP IN THE VAL EUR W E Alloni

The redeployment of the Walloon economy started ten years ago is bearing fruit
with the creation of over 45,000 jobs, funding of more than 415,000
training and nearly 2,000 researchers, leading through innovation and
value creation, on many successes of Walloon SMEs.
Industrial process launched with the Marshall Plan in 2005, extended
2009 with the Marshall Plan 2.vert, must now, with the Marshall Plan in 2022,
enter a new phase of growth to create jobs
quality which Wallonia needs. For this it is essential to reaffirm
conviction the need to intensify industrial policy developed on base
competitiveness clusters, the main instrument of the Walloon renewal.
Only industry, understood as the set of processing activities which
value is added to a product or a service, is able to generate the
times as much private investment in research and development that
export capacity. Over 80% of our exports are indeed the fruit
industrial activities. Not to mention that industrial activities have an effect
positive about the creation of indirect jobs. High tech rooms that are
found on turbines or rockets, through the production of
best beers in the world or developing innovative margarines
health benefits, our Region has multiple businesses with
products and services are appreciated worldwide.

English term for private investment in clean corporate funds (capital).

72

International expansion must become an automatism in our businesses to
to create opportunities beyond our borders. The Marshall Plan, in this
respect, heavily favored this revolution in mentalities, situating
Wallonia and its contractors on the map.
The PS project for companies is to make every effort to ensure that
the latter are the best. Training, innovation,
breaking down barriers and export will in this regard it will take paths
continue to borrow to support our companies to excellence. From
Similarly, the PS wants to continue efforts to that Wallonia
consider entrepreneurship as a key competence.
The focus on industrial policy will enable the Region to generate
growth while ensuring its transition towards a circular approach
the economy. The circular economy approach, transverse axis of Walloon
industrial policy entitled "NEXT" is to bring out solutions
to enable innovative decoupling of economic growth
the increased consumption of such resources focusing
the joint use of material flow and energy between companies, and
mutualisation of goods and services.
Wallonia must be the goal of achieving the EU target to
increase the share of industry in the Walloon GDP to 20% by 2020,
as the primary means of creating the jobs of tomorrow.
2.1. AMPLIFIERLAPOL IT IQUEDESP LESDECOMP O S T IT IV IT Y
Since 2005, the policy of competitiveness clusters initiated a renewal of
industrial policy in Wallonia based mainly on partnership
businesses (small and large), research centers and Operators
formations.
Based mainly from rupture of innovation projects,
industrial recovery that is emerging today demonstrates that:





Governance of the Walloon industrial policy based on the
Development of a policy whose orientations are conducted by
Industrial and supported by the public authorities is an appropriate model;
Wallonia, in traditional and emerging industries
has the skills and know-how it can also enhance
although in areas totally innovative activities in
niches with high added value;
competitiveness clusters constitute bases of regional roots
value chains, which are known to be global;
taking into account the changes in our industrial fabric
fundamental to identify potentially creative sectors
value added and employment in local presence, based on analysis
valeur6 channels worldwide.

A value chain can be defined as the set or the sequence of steps needed to
move a product / service design, production and finally to delivery, including recycling.

73

Under the Marshall Plan 2. Green, this industrial policy based on the
clusters was enhanced by integrating it more into a vision
sustainable growth.
This policy, beyond individual industrial results generated
two other results. First, in the period from crossing crisis,
areas industrial assets in the competitiveness clusters policy have
increased and sustained growth of Wallonia.
On the other hand, these companies in our area have been included in
a networking system that allowed them to expand their spectrum analysis,
creating new opportunities for innovation and development.
The policy of competitiveness clusters far beyond one
legislature. It fits over a period of several industrial generations of
workers, researchers, teachers, trainers, financiers
must continue to be encouraged to enroll in this logic
decompartmentalisation and partnerships.
The cluster policy should be complemented by transverse axes
complementary with very high added value, particularly in the fields
following:
 circular economy ("Next"), to promote the transition to a
sustainable industrial system and to support the competitiveness of our
businesses through synergies they promote reuse
waste as a new resource;
 the creative economy by stimulating creativity and programs
Innovation in all its forms (not technological, artistic,
design, etc.) as Creative Wallonia;
 the "business innovation" (different approach to the market) and innovation
organizational (efficiency) in order to create productivity gains
endogenous;
 the information and communications technology (ICT) to
enable our SMEs to seize the opportunities of the digital economy
(e-business);
 Intellectual Property;
 internationalization to promote the international visibility of the poles,
attract international funding and create opportunities to
abroad for our companies.
The revival in the territory of Wallonia must be supported and it should
to further amplify the cluster policy to bring out all the results
this policy, and that the benefit of both Walloon companies that activity
Economic generally.
It is therefore necessary that the political economy and research are
perfectly in tune for projects and funding that are proposed
the poles, clusters and companies meet development needs
according to their stage of integration into industrial policy. The PS wants
prioritize support to companies that develop within the dynamic
competitive clusters that create more value. The
research programs will in turn reinforce this support logic
74

to areas of activity, and also provide for the strengthening of project
transversal support.
Furthermore, the poles should continue their policy of internationalization and
seeking new markets for their businesses.
To reinforce the policy of clusters as the main axis
the Walloon industrial policy, the PS proposes to:


promote better integration of SMEs in the dynamic clusters
competitiveness and clusters;



further enhance synergies between large companies and SMEs
Through clusters, research centers, clusters,
clusters and other stakeholders;



expand the overall dynamics already implemented by calls for projects
(research, investment shutters, training, internationalization) to
the creative economy and circular economy;



consider and study the positioning industry
Walloon within value7 channels to ensure adequate monitoring
industrial interrelationships and act pro-actively;







support companies in adopting a circular approach

energy consumption ;



organize research and implementation of foreign partners
Further technological developments introduced in
Wallonia. It should indeed go for innovations developed

75

abroad that enable our SMEs to fill up faster
innovation process;


strengthen synergies between the poles and the network operators



strengthen the alternation in the training projects implemented in
competitiveness clusters, both for SMEs than for large
businesses;



develop programs in universities and colleges
modules / courses in critical skills, such as
the legal aspects in the life science projects;



encourage any initiative to accelerate the placing on the
market including specific support to companies
partners who are developing industrial pilot projects.

2.2. Promot IR UNEWALLONIEATTRACTIVE ETQUIS EX DOOR
Recognized as the first European logistics region and as one of
the most attractive regions, Wallonia hosted and collaborated with many
international big names for the economic development of the territory,
with the creation of thousands of new jobs and strengthening the potential
research and innovation of our businesses. Since 2009,
Foreign investment has garnered thus generated the creation of 8,800
direct jobs. These new investments were also strongly
contributed to the growth of regional exports.
Our exports have grown exponentially in recent years,
especially in priority markets such as the BRICS, ASEAN and the Middle
and Middle East. They have also benefited from the recognition of our
areas of excellence internationally, through competitiveness clusters and
Walloon clusters, since it is precisely in these areas that we
find growth.
To enhance the attractiveness of Wallonia and to better support our
export enterprises, the PS proposes to:






supplement and improve the export aid and development
the company abroad (web marketing, partnerships for creating
Joint Ventures or joint R & D projects, networking, clustering
transborder and international, etc.), including devices
targeted for SME exporters as assistance to partnerships
International or making available coaching voucher;
enhance regional expertise in identifying new markets
our economic and commercial attachés (network of 109 positions
date) and our regional centers in Wallonia to better advise
our SMEs;
deepen international partnerships with our priority countries,
76

BRICS, ASEAN, Middle East, Africa, strengthening
exchanges of students and researchers to then allow them to
meet social and environmental needs in their country
of origin;

3.



integrating companies with foreign capital present in Wallonia
transnational partnerships in order to further ensure the anchoring in
relationship with competitiveness clusters;



support host structures of foreign investors (Welcome
Office), especially from the Asian continent and the Indian subcontinent to enable them to benefit from mentoring
professional and validate their implementation project in Wallonia;



encourage synergies with other European regions including
by organizing joint missions and joint presences
international exhibitions;



continue and deepen the relations between competitiveness clusters and
AWEX in its "foreign investment" dimension by
sustainability of high-level industry experts.

S OUTENIR SMEs AND INDEPENDENT

Alongside measures to improve access to finance, PS
wishes to continue the efforts for several years to allow
a greater number of people to undertake in good conditions.
It is found in Belgium excessive nervousness and sometimes a perception
negative of entrepreneurship. The contractor is, however, a key player in
development of our society and its welfare. This positive image
the contractor is built at school. It is not a question of making all
citizens entrepreneurs but to value the initiative and fight fear
failure, educate youth about entrepreneurship and encourage
individuals achieve their dreams.
As far as business creation, growth thereof carries
jobs. It is therefore fundamental in establishing a framework for
the activity of independent and SMEs so that they create jobs and
value.
The challenges faced by every entrepreneur vary according to its
skills, the size of its business, its industry and its stage
development. For each specific situation, companies should be able to
rely on public actors, whether coaching at the
launch, or an advanced board during the various stages of
development, specialized support for companies in difficulty,
funding (see above), aid to transmit its business or
to export.

77

Finally, the PS wants the tax to be a tool to support the real economy and
that allows companies to grow. Taxation should serve
a targeted policy on employment, innovation, education and investment
sustainable production, with a particular focus on SMEs. She must
be an encouragement to economic recovery and based on measures
pursuing specific goals that substitute for linear measurements whose
effects are insufficient.
Specifically, in fiscal matters, the PS offers include (see also
Taxation section):


recycle means connected to the notional interest scheme for the benefit of
SMEs, the purchasing power of workers and job creation;



double the current deduction for investment for SMEs when
These are investments that generate stable employment or investment
in Research and Development;



provide an additional increase of the investment deduction
for SMEs (see previous point) when investments
concerned are funded by equity;



encourage companies that invest in training their
workers by introducing a deduction increased to 120%;



raise the exemption rate of withholding tax payment
for SMEs who maintain their employment level to help these
companies without affecting workers' wages, and further amplify
for those who create new jobs;



encourage companies to increase their volume of employment,
doubling the share of tax-exempt income for the recruitment
additional staff in SMEs (firms with less than 11
workers);



facilitate the launch of new businesses by removing any
tax surcharge in the event of the absence or insufficiency of payments
anticipated the first five years;



support the growth of SMEs by allowing them to enjoy for a
minimum of 5 years, tax benefits they are entitled
(now, when success is with go, an SME can lose
tax benefits (eg loss of the reduced rate) because of its
Change (increase in staff, increase in profit ...));



grant targeted, new individual companies that
create a single lump and tax relief to the IPP during the five
first years of activities.

3.1. FAVORISERETVALORISERL 'ESPR IT FOR IN TREPRENDRE
Valuing the entrepreneurial spirit is value creating activity. The PS
wishes to encourage entrepreneurship while raising the target audience

wants to bring more people to embark on the road

For the PS, you must enable anyone to start a business. This is
why we must facilitate the installation and launch businesses through a
appropriate accompaniment and quality.
Meanwhile, it is also the duty of public authorities to ensure
educate entrepreneurs about the importance of coaching when
launch of their activity to reduce the risk of future failure. The efforts
conducted for several years with economic operators and animation

specialization of their business support services should be pursued

For the PS, the future Agency for Enterprise and Innovation (AEI), following the
merger between the Agency and the economic stimulus stimulation Agency

growth and business innovation, but also in information and

In recent years, significant resources have been devoted to
support for new entrepreneurs ("starters") with
Effective mechanisms including, in particular, pre-business award. These
measures have proved their worth and should be continued.
For the PS, the next step is to complete the range of aid with a
more pronounced support to the development and growth of businesses
existing. Indeed, it must be in parallel to the pre-activity, offer support
quality growing companies. Our companies must grow as
and volume, which should result in more job creation.
For the PS, large, medium and small businesses are complementary. There
presence of large companies should be encouraged because they play a role
structuring for all companies. The vast majority of our
81

businesses are small or medium but have a high capacity
growth that is identified to help them grow.
PS proposes to:


identify high-growth potential companies (called
"Hidden Champions") in order to offer their consulting,
targeted training and funding at the local level through the
Operators economic leadership;



systematize the provision of independent directors
high level for a limited time;



study the impact of legal devices that generate effects "effects
threshold "impeding business growth.

Besides the creation and development of enterprises, it is crucial to finally
assist companies in difficult circumstances to find
effective solutions for out of crisis and challenge status
growth.
To do this, the proposed PS:


sustaining, based on the evaluation of the pilot project, the support tool
front line "of firms in difficulty Center (EDC)" and
ensure better visibility;



Board perpetuate the tool and accompanying "credit mediator";



continue the interim management policy and strengthen its suitability



identify independent in difficulty who turn to the CPAS
put them in touch with business centers in difficulty.

3.3. VALORISERL 'ENTREPRENAR IA TCOOP É ratif
The cooperative movement and the PS share a story that is based on
common values. The cooperative model demonstrates another economy
possible by following strong principles such as democratic management,
primacy of service to the community, solidarity, fair sharing
resources, training, long term, innovation or job creation
local rather than profit.
At a time when some entrepreneurs rediscover cooperative values,
partnership and sharing the cooperative model demonstrates its relevance
as the foundation of a sustainable economic model. In times of crisis,
social purpose cooperatives have weathered the storm better than other forms
companies through a combination of their strong values ​​and efficiency of their
management. The many projects that develop the field are only
confirm this renewed interest.
In Belgium, the Company Code defines as a cooperative society
single specific form of commercial company whose characteristics
82

main are to have a number of partners and variable capital without not
is required while meeting the essential cooperative values. Many
Companies therefore undermine the cooperative spirit for purely tax reasons and
administrative.
Today, the PS wants to qualitatively strengthen the cooperative model in
its status, recognition, in terms of simplification or access aid
Business. He also wants to make it better known and more used by
entrepreneurs because it is a real alternative to the individualistic model
and capitalist.
To further support the cooperative model, the PS proposes to:
 reform the cooperative corporation status to enroll compliance
standards and values ​​of personal and mutual responsibility and to
democratic governance, equality, equity and solidarity as
defined within the International Cooperative Alliance;
 mainstream of cooperative entrepreneurship, and values,
in educating students, whatever their discipline,
entrepreneurship;
 inform prospective entrepreneurs about the cooperative model by
Public accompanying tools for the creation of enterprises and give it
more visibility;
 boost scholarships for organizational innovation for
Companies wishing to organize their transition to a model
Cooperative;
 support, through the Walloon decree on "social enterprises", the
creation of cooperative societies with a social purpose, the innovative
technological, environmental and social;
 strengthen the collective dimension of the cooperative project by requiring, for
form a cooperative society, a minimum of five co-operators (the
instead of three at present) and five directors instead of one and
implement, for cooperatives, the principle of
"Economic democracy" in the company's management (a cooperator,
a voice) ;

develop, in consultation with unions, a legal mechanism
granting to workers in the event of liquidation or closure of a
business, pre-emptive rights to acquire the company in a
cooperative form, with the guarantee of maintaining the same social status;



clarify the allocation of profits to make them a priority
assigned to the development of the cooperative.

Fifteen percent of independent still live under the threshold of
Poverty, which represents about 150,000 people in our country. There
reality for many of them, these are precarious incomes and
painful pace of life, with the fear of not being able to make ends meet.

84

There is almost ten years, the PS was the maneuver when the extension of the
coverage of independent health care (small risks). Recent
years, many improvements were made to the social status of
independent by the Federal Government.
Among the most reforms
important are the reform of the calculation of contributions, alignment
family allowances, or the adjustment of pensions with alignment
the minimum pension at household rate on that of employees as well as the
revaluation, in the well-being of minimum pensions.
Previously, workers were either independent or employees throughout
their professional career. Mobility barely existed. Us
are now in a different configuration as most
self-employed have a mixed career. To facilitate the transition of a
status to another, but also to reduce the risk of poverty found among
self-employed, the PS intends to gradually bring the
for self-employed to that of salaried workers.
To make the system fairer, we must correct the collection system
social contributions by self because if the vast majority of independent
(97%) pays contributions proportional to their income, independents
reach a level of income of 80,000 euros benefit, themselves, a
cap.
For example, a person who receives income only 150,000 euros
pays 10 percent of premiums while the independent who receives
modest income of 30,000 euros pays him 21pourcents.
This is why the PS supports removing the ceiling of social security contributions
for self-employed, which falls far from the most basic
solidarity. This uncapping would provide for an extension of
social security benefits in favor of independent, and if the margins
unobstructed permit, relief small minimum contributions
independent, especially young people who start.
To facilitate the launch of the activity, the SP wants to strengthen the quality of
accompaniment
of

(see

Support) in order to increase the chances of success. Support
Financial needs to be conditioned by a better accompaniment.
In the next legislature, the PS proposes to:


rebalance solidarity among independent by uncapping
social contributions;



increase the amount of the minimum pension for a single person,
employed as independent, at least 1,300 euros / month (for
full career) by the end of the legislature;



T HE R deform PUBLIC

Representing 19% of the gross domestic product of the European Union, markets
public have a very important impact on business and employment. It's a
leverage that public authorities must use to condition certain
expenses and positively influence the development of our economy in favor of
welfare workers, business development and
sustainability.
The reform introduced at European level, at the initiative of Socialist MEPs,
should be a turning point to modernize the Belgian legislation on markets
Public and finally put an end to social and environmental dumping
destroyed the prospect of fair competition, deteriorating working conditions
abyss of workers and the environment. Meanwhile, the reform must
lead to a real strategy of sustainable procurement and the development of a vision
strategic for each contracting authority. Generalizing gradually
the use of social clauses in the public procurement, the PS
also wants to encourage more decent wages for workers. This
Reform is finally the opportunity for the PS to facilitate access to public procurement
for SMEs.
For all these reasons, the proposed PS:


widespread use to the economically most advantageous tender which,
the price as favors other criteria such as quality, respect
social and environmental criteria and sustainability at the
award of a public contract;



gradually expand the use of social clauses and
environmental in public procurement taking into account the
nature of the market and the sector concerned;



encourage dialogue between companies and contracting authorities
to gradually improve the use and practice of clauses
social and environmental realistic;



to provide contracting authorities of model clauses
social and environmental "types" and manuals
use to facilitate their effective use;



organizing training, educate target audiences (powers
contracting, CPAS, social operators, associations, etc.) and their
providing administrative and functional support by "facilitators"
the drafting of specifications load, implementation, monitoring and
evaluation of social clauses in public contracts;



promote the use of "flexible" clause to outsourcing
a part of the market to the social economy and / or the involvement of
the successful tenderer to the training of young people and seekers
employment;



strictly regulate the use of outsourcing by introducing a
co-responsibility between the prime contractor and subcontractors as well as
forcing the major prime contractor to identify the parts of the
service that will be subcontracted, the identity of the subcontractor and the
price of this service;



improve access to public procurement for SMEs by rules more
flexible to book their lots and their grant support



enable contracting authorities and businesses to choose
the most appropriate methods to local market realities;



implement a detection mechanism and price controls
abnormally low in public procurement through the creation
Federal and regional observatories prices to advise the
contracting authority ;



enhance control to detect issuing of bidders
execution false certificates;



provide, where possible, a quantitative and qualitative objective
given to the employment of people distant from the labor market;



improve compliance with control mechanisms and social clauses



coordinate the work of different levels of government (federal and state
Regions) by a cooperation agreement to pay particular
a more precise definition of the price breakdown, capacity

Project authors in price control, etc.

D EVELOPING THE SOCIAL AND SOLIDARITY ECONOMY E

The sociale9 economy plays a fundamental role in the development of
local services with high social added value for the population.
Furthermore, the social economy plays a crucial role in the integration of
jobseekers.
The PS has always supported the social economy by giving it a structural framework. TO
This requires that the social economy develops further to become a
genuine activity creating leverage and employment across devices
existing regional (integration enterprises, local services IDESS,
VESTA, Ressourceries, short circuits ...).

At European level, the PS proposes to:


support, within the framework of the European system of state aid (Commission Regulation
General Block Exemption), taking better account
criterion of "disadvantaged workers" hired by the company
Social Economy for grants.

At the regional level, the PS proposes to:

coming years.

MPROVING ruled NCE THE CORPORATE FOR MORE
TRANSPARENCY AND EQUAL

Business activities have a direct impact on workers,
shareholders and suppliers. They also have a social responsibility,
cultural and environmental sustainability to the whole of society.
To claim the so-called "corporate social responsibility
"(CSR), several conditions must be met by the
businesses. Indeed, they must have begun a process in dialogue with
all their stakeholders (employees, shareholders, suppliers,
customers, residents and others) to address the negative externalities created
by their activité10. It may even be a political "CSR" be much better
that limiting this externality and positively impact the environment (

10

As defined in 2011 by the European Commission.

88

example by limiting pollution beyond legal obligations or
the adoption of an action plan dedicated to the welfare of workers).
The PS wants to encourage companies to engage on this path of CSR
so that they take their responsibilities more widely especially
to improve the consideration for the welfare of workers and the impact
Environmental activities.
In terms of corporate social responsibility, the PS proposes to:
 to develop the social report content that companies need
set to include social responsibility policy
(CSR) to all its stakeholders and
in any case encompassing sustainable development, the welfare of
workers and the continuity of the business, without increasing costs
administrative.
In terms of promoting equality between women and men in
companies, important legislative developments in recent years
should be welcomed. But the road is still long for women
are as well represented as men in the said positions
responsibility. Thus, the boards are still unbalanced in
gender representation material without forgetting the steering committees,
executives and boards of companies. Equality and responsibilities
skills also implies equal pay.
To fight against gender inequality in business, the PS offers
including (See also Chapters male / female equality and employment):


strengthen the law control mechanism to fight against
the pay gap including through reports published by
the Institute for the equality of women and men and the view of the Council
equality of women and men;



encourage the establishment of an equality plan within large
companies including measures in the fight against the
wage inequalities and inequalities due to fringe benefits,
balanced distribution of women and men in different
enterprise levels;



insert in the Belgian Corporate Governance Code a section
on the fight against discrimination;



provide dependent employers an obligation to inform
systematic workers about the consequences
wage in terms of career and pension, or the choices they
they want to do;



promote the role of women in boards and
management committees of companies.

RESEARCH AND INNOVATION
The progress of knowledge is at the heart of economic dynamism and
Social our regions, vitality of our businesses. The latter depends
including the excellence and creativity of all research stakeholders.
By transforming the modalities of production of goods and delivery
services, research stimulates productivity and competitiveness of our
business, creates jobs and helps improve quality of life
citizens.
Basic research, applied research and innovation are
essential levers for a company that positively evolves and develops,
fair and inclusive manner.
Basic research, Wallonia and Brussels reached a level
excellence recognized worldwide as evidenced in 2013, awarding the Prize
Nobel physics at ULB Professor Englert. Basic research is
an indispensable source to feed the applied research.
If basic research must be strengthened, while maintaining its
independence, applied research must expand and diversify. This
Indeed last translated into practical applications and new knowledge
is the origin of the innovation process and creating new
economic activities.
Today, we can welcome the fact that large companies invest
in sectors like pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, participating in the
Job creation. To affirm the research capacity of our regions, it is
important to encourage investment diversification by exploring
new research areas, with greater involvement of SMEs in these
dynamic research and supporting them to transform these results
creating new economic activities.
This is the thread of the action of the Walloon Government which, for nearly 10
years, has developed competitive clusters. We must now capitalize on the
research results while identifying new niches
development.
For the PS, our Regions must develop innovation strategies
identify potential expertise and development opportunities
economic activity and support the economic development of these
sectors. The innovation strategy should be based on these clusters
and within the framework of the EU priorities in order to benefit
resources, networks and dynamics of research & innovation
European.
In Wallonia, the Marshall2.vert plan has strengthened the research areas
developed over the past decade in the clusters. It is necessary
now capitalize on research results while identifying
new development niches.

90

The PS supports the development of a dynamic innovation that links research,
Industrial policy and training policy between the different levels of
power concerned. The Regions and the Wallonia-Brussels Federation must
continue their efforts with the federal government to have an organization
Effective decoupling to avoid too frequent between activities
performing research on one side and economic and societal developments
on the other.

1.

SE PROVIDE AN ACTUAL SYSTEM SUPPORT
RESEARCH AND INNOVATION

The world of research consists of a multitude of actors, the
fundamental research to industrial and technological application. With
Creative Wallonia, Wallonia has been designated 'European Creative District "with the
Tuscany, among fifty European regions. For the PS, the stakes
to change our approach to research and innovation policy in order
place Wallonia, FWB and the country in regions and Member States of
EU high capacity for innovation.
To meet this ambitious project, the PS proposes to develop between all
levels of power at the start of term, a strategic plan "innovation"
linking research, industrial policy, economic policy and political
training.
This plan will be achieved by:
 a strong emphasis on research and innovation in own budgets
Regions, the Wallonia-Brussels Federation and the Federal State and
as in programs developed under the projects of the Union
European;
 greater mobility between undertakings, research centers,
universities and federal scientific institutions;
 strong synergies between actors of the Walloon innovation, those of the
Brussels-Capital Region and those of the federal State;
 close links with the research component of the 2022 Marshall Plan.

EXPANDING AND DEEPENING OF DYNAMIC INNOVATION

The PS wants to develop an expansion strategy to integrate all
the components of innovation whether technological or not
in technology:


making available of all forms of innovation skills
science and technology available in Wallonia and Brussels;



structuring a genuine area of ​​technology sharing;





developing a greater dimension (inter) Federal, European and
International.

The PS also wants to develop a strategy for deepening
to focus on a number of targets and providing the tools

The PS proposes to:


rely on clusters to become more
a major instrument of policy for innovation;



organizing cross-fertilization between the poles to emerge from
new industrial axes;



develop a specialization towards certain areas of identified clusters
as the most promising;



intensify the opening and positioning of poles internationally.
1.2.

DEVELOPING INNOVATION IN UNIVERSITIES AND RESEARCH CENTRES
FEDERAL SCIENTIFIC ESTABLISHMENTS

Basic Research Programs promote the emergence of new
Knowledge and innovation. The crossing of disciplines and unpredictability are two
among the most favorable conditions for innovation. Yet the chances of
see these selected projects are often lower, given their character
unforeseen and therefore difficult to integrate an innovation strategy.
For basic research, the PS proposes to:


support young researchers confirmed for the installation and
optimal development of new research teams (start-up
packages), building on existing mechanisms including in Flanders;



book a strengthened permanent attention to researchers in the
universities;



develop basic research funding programs
"Strategic" as qu'initiés in biomedical sciences in the WELBIO
targeting the disciplines of international excellence with a profile in
our universities;



fund research projects specifically transdisciplinary
original and risky and provide a specific evaluation criteria with
adapted by an ad hoc Scientific Committee;



maintain a federal mechanism for cooperation between universities
north and south of the country to consolidate excellence in all
areas of basic research and to facilitate the integration of these
Belgian networks in European and international networks;



ensure that federal scientific institutions level
financing allowing them to stay leading actors
level research.

IMPROVING THE TRANSITION BETWEEN RESEARCH AND THE WORLD ECONOMIC AND
INDUSTRIAL

Under this term, the Agency for Enterprise and Innovation (AEI) was created
at the initiative of the PS. It now includes all the skills
innovation including the technological component, stimulation and
economic leadership, spirit of enterprise and control tools
digital. This is a step towards more coherence and efficiency
the companies and the economic, technological and
Innovation in Wallonia.
For the PS, the AEI must:


implement a regional innovation system in partnership with
DG06 its partners, AWEX, Forem etc. ;



without prejudice to the freedom of research, put in place mechanisms
effective to enhance the impact of the various possible
fondamental research ;



identify untapped search results and contacting them
research teams and investors;



stimulate the integration of innovation in all its components
(technological and non-technological) in a sustainable manner
Strategy Walloon companies;



strengthen field crews, such as the approved research centers, which
innovative potential prospect to the companies and that frame
innovative companies in their processes;



support, through innovation, industrial, social and cultural development
of the Region.
1.4.

PROMOTING SYNERGY BETWEEN DIFFERENT OPERATORS

Support for research must be based on the existence of efficient public tools
structured and not redundant. In Belgium, the institutional evolution
fragmented support. Public research players have to organize in
networks. This structure could be supported by inter-operator financing.
The PS will encourage synergies:


between research stakeholders in further defining the role of each
and strengthening the specificities and complementarities;



between disciplines including by taking into account the impact of
technologies on society;



in sharing of equipment and infrastructure;



level funding programs whether European,
federal, regional or the Federation Wallonia-Brussels.

1.5.

BUILDING ON EXCELLENCE OF FEDERAL RESEARCH AGENCIES

The PS wants to:


continue creating convergence and synergies between
federal scientific institutions like the centers of excellence
on "climate", "Earth and the sun," "molecular taxonomy"
"Mapping";



at the wealth management, consolidate the scattered collections
to form new museum sets more consistent (Art
modern and contemporary, art nouveau, Flemish primitives, antique, arts
Decorative ...);



launch a master renovation plan for the Royal Museums of Art and History
including the Cinquantenaire site;



examine the possibility of developing in Wallonia, a decentralized Site
highlighting federal collections, like the "Louvre-Lens";



to provide federal collections in infrastructure
existing or in the form of a "mobile museum";



support the federal scientific institutions in the pursuit of
all of their missions as conservatories and display cases
our heritage as a scientific public service providers
for the whole country and finally as actors of research;



promote linkages between federal scientific institutions and
universities, including the establishment of post-masters courses and
doctorates with institutions.

Moreover, the PS wants:


support collaboration between research stakeholders and, if
appropriate, from industry, from different levels of power to
reach a level of critical mass in research areas
considered strategic such as energy, sustainable development, climate,
Space or health policy.
1.6.

DEVELOPING SOCIAL INNOVATION

Social innovation can be defined as the development and
implementing a new solution that responds more adequately the
existing solutions to a defined social need.
The PS wants to:


support universities in mobilizing skills
academic humanities, including the "Fresh Funds"
to power political considerations but also by citizens
for social and territorial development;



decompartmentalize circuits help to launch economic activities there
including the profiles of the social innovator;

2.

F INANCER RESEARCH AND INNOVATION

The objective of spending 3% of GDP on research and development (including a
third from the public sector and two thirds from the private sector) must be
continued. By 2020, the PS wants this objective.
The PS wants to promote the idea that R & I, which are primarily
investments in the future, are no longer included in the calculation of deficits
public.
For the PS, research and innovation achieve better results
when federate the means from the different levels of power.
To optimize research funding, the PS wants to:


simplify and harmonize public support systems and financing
ensuring ensure greater coherence between calls for proposals;



introducing greater transparency and rigor in financing
projects, particularly in generalizing the use of experts
foreign independent high level to evaluate requests
credits or positions;



defend the continuation of inter-university attraction poles (IAP)
maintaining collaborations between universities in the FWB, Flanders and

STRATEGY AND FINANCE FOCUSED ON GROWTH

IDENTIFIED AS PRIORITY SECTORS

To overcome the difficulties beyond business creation
(defining growth strategies and ability to identify investors
Private able to participate in the second or third round of financing)
it is necessary that :


organize contacts with sectoral investment funds
foreign, also allowing better knowledge of markets and
international networks;



establish sectoral and cross-cells within public Invests
and facilitate coordination between the various Invests Folder
themes.

2.2. PROMOTING RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BY TAXATION
The PS wants to maintain tax relief mechanisms for
research. New tax measures will be designed to:


double the current deduction for investment for SMEs when
These are investments that generate stable employment or investment
in Research and Development;



provide an additional increase of the investment deduction
for SMEs (see previous point) when investments
concerned are funded by equity;



examine the possibility of applying a regime "tax shelter" for SMEs
the innovative biotechnology sector by strengthening the direct link
with potential investors and the company;



encourage corporate sponsorship by a tax mechanism adapted in
Holders technology;



making donations and bequests to recognized public foundations
directly concerned by the most attractive research on
registration fee and succession;



consider raising the ceiling on deductible donations to institutions

the health sector.
2.3.

Redeploy PUBLIC FINANCING TOOLS BASIC AGREEMENT
OBJECTIVES

The landscape of research actors must be redefined in line with the strategy
research and innovation, notably by setting up contracts
credible objectives.
96

According to the PS, two funding criteria should be favored:
 the systematic search for critical mass and cooperation, in
including at international level, for greater efficiency,
 funding linked to performance.
Furthermore, the opening of border and international tools in their
all must be promoted, and developed strong synergies with the Brussels-Capital Region.
More specifically, for intermédiation13 devices, the proposed PS
of:


linking funding to performance, set in contracts
objectives;

research and innovation, should be helped.
For the PS, it is appropriate to pay particular attention to all stages of

SMEs contribute less than a third (28.4%) in investments in
research and innovation.
Moreover, many innovative SMEs, especially in the sector

PROMOTE THE S P S BUSINESS RESEARCH

Careers in research contributing to the prosperity and social justice
our Regions. The development and exploitation of new ideas support the
progress, creation of economic activities and give birth to new
jobs. The PS defends increased investment in research careers.
Yet the profession "researcher" is exercised today as a multiplicity
statutes covering the wage scale conditions and career prospects
very diverse.
Too often, the quality of work of a researcher is able only to
number of publications and referrals. For the PS, the amount is not
always synonymous with quality and other criteria should be more
valued in the qualitative assessment of production of the researcher.
The PS wants to improve the career and status of researchers.
PS proposes to:


harmonizing route by facilitating mobility between institutions
(portability of rights and seniority) and improving readability



create a university-business co-financing system for the
realization of theses researchers working in companies and

visibility of research conducted in Wallonia-Brussels.
The PS wants to strengthen the networking of researchers at European level
and international including support for participation in conferences and
scientific meetings or brief stays in an institution abroad.

AVOID BRAIN DRAIN

In terms of mobility, the reports of the Joint Research Centre of the
European Commission show that researchers are especially attracted to
research capacity of a country, the quality of its research and its
infrastructure. However, the level of compensation is only one element
among others and does not seem to pose major problems in Belgium 14.

E L A VALUATING REC Herche

The evaluation of research, process and outcome turns out to be a tool
Steering indispensable to ensure the most efficient use of
public means. While preserving the independence of research
fundamental, evaluation should be performed a priori, in the selection of
research projects, and a posteriori, based on the results that research has
able to reap the benefits and objectively there is hope.
The experience of the Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP) and the FNRS shows
These evaluations are particularly relevant when they mobilize
international experts. Assessments should involve specific projects
but also research programs in general.
The PS wants to:


organize the evaluation of research at inter-university level;



systematically evaluate the players in applied research (centers
Applied Research - CRA, academic centers) according to
scientific and economic or industrial benefits;



extend for regional funding, and project evaluation

COMPULSORY EDUCATION
The school remains one of the main levers for the well-being of citizens. It
allows each child, each young will acquire the knowledge, know-being
expertise necessary for its integration into the society of today. The school
aims to train responsible citizens, open to criticism and
world. It should allow to develop the skills that will enable
each of emancipation, grow professional and personal level.
According to the latest PISA studies, these international surveys that measure
level of students for all Western countries, the educational system
Wallonia-Brussels Federation (FWB) is one of the most unequal in the OECD,
despite the measures taken for 20 years.
How our education system is built generates inequalities
between schools, between pupils that produce unsatisfactory overall results.
Some schools focus the difficulties and others welcome the students
stronger academically but also those with more social capital. The good ones
students progress together while the weaker students are held back
in their evolution when they are concentrated in the same schools. Since
2000 PISA results show that the increase in inequality in FWB
Due to the strong segregation between schools, and that systems

complex.
The major economic challenges

which are faced Regions
to end this school market logic
effectively schools prepare students better
others are reduced to managing misery

For the PS, the main goal should be raising the level of performance and
reducing inequalities. All means of education should be
mobilized to achieve these goals. Improving the quality and equity
our education demand assessment, consultation and
continuous adjustment measures to boost social mobility.
In schools, educational teams are mobilizing, developing solutions
to meet the students' difficulties. These experiences should be
supported, developed, evaluated for wider dissemination. Priority
must carry on the fight against failure and grade repetition. Teachers need
be able to propose alternative solutions to the repetition,
adapted to each child.
For the PS, you have to trust the actors of education. In order to
meet with the school's mission, it is important to identify all the
problems and the most effective solutions and evaluate their implementation.
The mobilization of teachers is a priority of the PS. Must be offered
teachers the means to transmit knowledge and skills in
best conditions.
104

But it is not enough to provide educational teams of appropriate tools, it is necessary
also restore strength to its mission of emancipation and social justice.
Yet some do not perceive the purpose and meaning of the reforms under
the difficulties they face in their daily lives. We must therefore review the implementation
implement school goals while continuing to refer to the objectives
included in the 'missions' decree.
To (re) legitimize the goals of our education system, PS offers
"Pact for Education" involving, in some respects, the lifeblood
Walloon and Brussels. It will be preceded by a wide consultation in order
identify ways to achieve the ambitious goals of improving
performance of our educational system and reducing social inequalities
academic achievement.
The PS defends the mobilization of all around a mobilizing project for
the school and its actors. Everyone, whether teacher, head of establishment,
student, student, parent, association or union actor, economic official,
political agent, must feel involved in future developments of
educational system.
Regarding public school, PS will be attentive to defend public education
and reaffirm the continued management of the public school in the logic of
the authority of the public service.
The actors, each according to their level of intervention will have more
autonomy while being accountable, based on test scores
in a logic of external regulation and control. This accountability
must address the educational, social and organizational. The PS
wants to renew the school governance, from the experience of players
field evaluation results and indicators of the education system.
For the PS, the school must integrate, it must unite and not separate. The school
all children, whatever their social, cultural or philosophical.
The school must be unique and open to all, the success of all children.

1. SUCCESSFUL E P ROMOTING
PS, we think our school system must accommodate all students
to lead them to the highest of their abilities, without lowering the level. The
fight against inequality is actually first class, in the relationship
Learning with appropriate educational tools, based on a
Initial and continuing training of teachers renewed.
1.1.

MANAGING KNOWLEDGE BASE

Mastery of basic knowledge must remain an essential priority. Every
Students must attain the skills and knowledge considered essential for
fit, contribute to development, to live, participate in society. This
minimum threshold consists of reading comprehension, speaking,
written expression, solving mathematical problems, the approach
science and technology, knowledge of foreign languages ​​and
mastery of information technologies.
105

For the PS, the mastery of basic skills is the most average
effective fight against social and cultural inequalities. It is the mission
Master of basic education and the common core of education
secondary. The means must be implemented to ensure that all
Students master these basic skills.
1.1.1. SPEAK, READ, WRITE
Speak, read, understand and write the French language condition access to all
areas of knowledge and the acquisition of all skills. Mastering
spelling is crucial to facilitate the acquisition of knowledge in
all disciplines who use the written word. From an early age, that is to say,
from the first kindergarten, positive contacts with learning
fundamental - and more specifically with the language of instruction - will
developed.
The PS wants to:


develop a grammar book of common spelling
primary and secondary education and distribute it widely with
parents and the general public;



strengthening workshops literacy, homework schools
for pupils outside school hours and workshops
literacy to parents who do not master
knowledge base;



improve the mastery of French, particularly spelling,
among new teachers as part of the reform of the
initial training ;



develop partnership projects with public libraries and
encourage lending of books in classrooms.

For students whose French is not the usual language, attention
particular should help address specific challenges they
meet.
PS proposes to:


apply the teaching methods of the French language
developed in host devices and schooling primoarrivants (DASPA) students who do not have a mastery of
sufficient French when they arrive in education;



increase the number of DASPA based on identified needs;



develop pedagogical tools (manuals, software ...) specific.

The report written changes with the generalization of computers, smartphones and
tablets.

106

The PS supports initiatives to give meaning to learning
of writing. And especially :


research on modes of expression developed by children and
Adolescents with new means of communication in order to define
new skills and knowledge that teachers need
develop students to discuss and practice new
Multimodal records;



evaluation and, where appropriate, updating of initiatives such
Operation "Journalists budding" and "Open my daily life."
1.1.2. CALCULATE

Mathematics is considered difficult. This representation can be
exceeded with positive experiences in early learning. The
fundamental teachers should benefit from the extensive knowledge
mathematics, learning difficulties and methodologies
can lead and build mathematical thinking as progress in
Mathematics is also acquiring the notion of abstraction and promote
concrete. An update of methods and learning tools will
performed.
For the PS, it is important to:


propose a concrete mathematical content and appropriate fashion
at different stages of development of students, in line with
diversity of its uses in society;



foster learning mathematics through more approach
convenient and fun.
1.1.3. DEVELOPING SCIENTIFIC REASONING

The sciences are playing an increasingly important role in our daily lives.
In the perspective of a mastery of skills and knowledge needed to
fit in contemporary society, the mastery of a basic pedestal
Science is essential. However, the results for science
PISA studies in Wallonia-Brussels Federation are largely in
below the European average. It is therefore urgent to raise the level of
Science proficiency. Scientific fields that offer opportunities
are not currently met. The focus should be on actions to
for pupils of 10-15 years before they chose their first
orientation before entering higher education. Experimentation
helps control of scientific reasoning, it allows students to
perceive how science is built. Students need to be there
face to measure how much science is not static. In addition, the PS
be careful that the practical dimension, particularly in the register
Scientific, initial training is strengthened.

107

To educate students for careers in science and technology, the PS
offers:


encourage, in the competence centers and in the centers
autographed reference to new technologies, animation modules
like "Technikids" tailored to students 6-18 years of age;



develop partnerships between primary and secondary schools schools
for the provision of premises, materials, teachers
discover science experiments for elementary students;



develop scientific skills of new teachers
As part of the reform of initial training;



organizing awareness days and practices of science
Attention all teachers;



implement "scientific buses" that sail the schools
FWB;



Teachers make available suitable audiovisual material
whether by the Media, RTBF or enseignement.be.
1.1.4. PROMOTING THE CONTROL OF OTHER LANGUAGES

Each student, regardless of the industry study, must be able to
communicate in at least one other language at the end of his studies.
Language learning should benefit from attractive methods, live,
placing the student in a real situation, from an early age, especially in
bilingual areas.
For the PS, language teaching should be reviewed so as to promote
a more communicative, interactive dynamic, using
fully the opportunities of information technology and
communication to make the course more attractive languages.
The PS defends:


the progressive organization in the first primary of a language course
in all schools in Brussels and Wallonia;



the implementation of the Cooperation Agreement between Communities
promote the exchange of professors and organizing green classes
Dutch and German;



the opening of language teaching positions to which teachers
teach in their mother tongue by facilitating the recognition of
securities;



support for activities or projects organized in another language;



the implementation of a monitoring and a language test
during cycles and levels passages;



strengthening plans 'Languages' regional (internet platform
learning, courses oriented "trade", language courses,
108

immersion, internship ...).
The PS also wants:


enhance opportunities to follow one second in a sixth secondary
another language in Flanders, speaking Community or abroad;



continue granting scholarships for language immersion courses
students and teachers;



develop language courses oriented "business" for students
calling.

In recent years, immersion teaching raises increasingly
interest. The number of basic and secondary schools that are committed
in this way is constantly growing.
The PS wants to:


develop immersion teaching being careful that it is
a social and cultural emancipation factor.
1.1.5. STRENGTHENING THE USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND
COMMUNICATION

For fifteen years the political cross between Regions and FWB
allow to equip schools with new technologies. This sector,
constantly changing, requires both regular updating equipment
but also training and regular updating of knowledge
teachers.
Under the leadership of the PS, this Parliament has seen the emergence of a new dynamic
Digital to bring the use of information technology and
communication in a hundred schools. The aim now is to
emerging digital requirements and to respond in the most appropriate manner
possible in all classes. We must equip our students with equipment
modern and appropriate to their needs. We must also make sense to use
digital so that our children and our youth become actors
digital and not (only) Consumer Technology
Information and communication. The PS wants to generalize this dynamic
digital in all schools, from fundamental to higher education.
The PS wants to:


encourage further appropriate equipment to student profiles
and teachers and improving school connectivity;



encourage support for teaching staff in the use of
information technologies and communication;



encourage the teaching of ICT lecturers engaged
with the professional world of reality;



promote the establishment and the provision of tools and applications
109

evolutionary teaching age-appropriate;


ensure the creation of an educational community with the establishment of
online resources platforms;



consult publishers to encourage the creation of textbooks
interactive;



promote the use of free software;



simplify, for schools and teachers, procedures
access to digital tools for teaching or
acquisition of necessary training software;



strengthen, in the initial and continuing training of teachers,
specific modules for integrating new technologies
education;



strengthening online exchange platforms for courses, testing and
reference works.

In view of active citizenship, the SP finds it very
important to address issues related to the use of ICT and new media
and develop critical thinking in relation to what we find in the media and
on the Web.
The PS defends:


the awareness of developing tools for the use of new media
allow students to forge a critical view contents
with a view to active citizenship.
1.1.6. ORGANIZE A COURSE OF PHILOSOPHY AND CITIZENSHIP AT SCHOOL

The school is a place for socializing, learning for citizenship, for living
together. She must prepare our youth to integrate diversity into a
pluralist society. For PS, the school and is participating in the construction of a base
cultural references common to all students, fostering social cohesion.
It must therefore not impose a choice of religious affiliation or
philosophy from the first primary. Each family must educate its
children as she wishes in an area that falls exclusively within the
private sphere.
The PS wants to establish at an early age, a common course of education
citizenship, in accordance with the principles of neutrality:


centered on living together and on the philosophical questioning in
Instead of one hour during religious or secular morality;



with benchmarks and specific bases;



including learning of democratic values, values ​​of
human rights, the values ​​of living together and approach
historical philosophies of religions and secular thought.

110

This proposal is an essential step to bring together children in a
Optical living together.
1.1.7. DEVELOP ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT
The school's mission is to prepare each student to take an active role in
economic, social and cultural. It must be receptive to
changes in the world around him. Undertaking is not a matter
mindset. We must first master certain tools, its environment,
so feel able to launch his business. In addition, the act
undertaking is not limited to the world of commercial enterprise. For the
PS, entrepreneurship should be understood as the ability to put
project; project that can be part of an economic, social or
cultural.
The entrepreneurial spirit has become a skill to be acquired throughout
training program.
The Agency for Enterprise and Innovation (ex stimulus Agency)
in Wallonia and the Brussels Enterprise Agency (BEA) organized in Brussels
awareness programs and information on the reality of
entrepreneurship in schools. These actions must be pursued and
developed. Promoting entrepreneurial skills and attitudes to all
levels of education must be a strategic priority of education.
For the PS, each student should have the opportunity to participate in a collective project
economic purpose, social or cultural, to implementation to evaluation.
The PS wants to:


organize several awareness events on entrepreneurship,
for each student during his schooling;



increase awareness of the initiative, entrepreneurship and innovation from
secondary education through group projects playful case basis
resolve to acquire the first reflexes;



train teachers so that they have a basic knowledge
enterprise and entrepreneurship through the organization of projects
entrepreneurial, corporate meetings in their diversity (sector
merchant, non-profit sector, social economy, worker
independent, small, medium or large);



integrate in the project of establishment of each school, a component to
developing entrepreneurship, including in areas not
competitive, as part of a caring and responsible society;



promote within class devices for students
live the realities of the business (testimony, situational, creation
mini-companies;



develop entrepreneur-teacher pairs.

111

1.2.

EXTEND THE CORE AND GIVE GENERAL DIMENSION
"POLYTECHNIC"

Two milestones organize education: firstly, the core
covering the period from the entry in compulsory education until the end of
first degree in secondary education and, secondly, the second and
third grade of high school. All sectors are concerned. A
technician must be able to read a leaflet in another language. A plumber should
control accounting for the sustainability of its business and relationships with its
customers. Whatever the professional future of the young, mastery of knowledge
base is essential. For the PS at the end of the core curriculum, all students
must master the basic skills and knowledge (math, reading, writing,
Science, multilingualism).
The consolidation of the core curriculum should guarantee that mastery of skills
basic. The core also avoids hasty directions and
incurred towards qualifying education. PS hears that core
includes, in addition to the mastery of basic skills, a polytechnic dimension.
The course of artistic awakening currently planned in the core
persist in the expanded core curriculum. It must allow each
student, to discover and develop a positive approach and techniques
technology, which will give all students a realistic idea of ​​Occupations
Technical guidance and will knowingly at the end of
core. Referral to a general or a qualifying industry sector
will not happen until 15 to 14 years old. This elongation of the
therefore accompany core (see above) a strengthening
early identification of student difficulties and remediation. For PS, this
core must be defined with teachers, inspectors,
educational consultants and academics.
The PS also intends to consolidate the core to avoid pre-orientations
hasty. He also wants to ensure students good mastery of skills
expected at the end of the core curriculum. At the core then would succeed
enrolling in a sector "business" preparing to exercise directly a
profession or pursuing his studies with a specialization in higher education.
The PS wants to be:


lengthen the core at least until the third secondary;



give this a polytechnic core dimension in addition to the
mastery of basic skills, introducing technical courses and y
Technology for all students;



back the common external certification evaluation at the end of core
to make the main measure of basic acquired before the orientation
to general courses, qualifying or artistic;



encourage the organization of trades discovery activities
Technical and Technological Advice for all students, promoting
mobility of students and teachers between schools;



reorganize the education offer to create degrees of observation
Autonomous (DOA) of 3 years, these establishments specializing in the
112

pursuit of the common trunk side, who will offer a real
educational continuum with basic education.
1.3.

GUIDING STUDENTS WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION

Strengthening the core inevitably involves improvement
referral processes and the development of a guidance-oriented approach.
Attendance at a sector is usually the result of academic selection and
Social relentless. Qualifying courses too often serve pathways
relegation. The choice of study is however an essential act for the future
every young. A positive choice is the best guarantee that the student
not pick and obtain a degree and a qualification.
This choice should be gradual. Each student has to have an instance
that welcomes and helps define his personal project, proposing a
information on the specificities of each sector study, opportunities and
realities of the labor market, promising businesses and qualifications
expected. The information made available to young people should be objective and not
commercial.
The psycho-medical and social centers (CPMS) must participate in this dynamic
orientation. Similarly, teachers have a vital role to play in
Information and orientation process of the students.
For the future, the PS proposes to:


strengthen support for students with transition moments
are the passages to the primary, the end of the core curriculum, studies
Graduate and working life;



delete orientation certificates that enable the transition to
the next year by limiting the types of education where the student can
sign up to support a positive direction;



develop, in guidance and monitoring of students, synergies
between the PMS centers and training providers to ensure
continuity of the orientation process;



create a cross-window (FWB and Regions) offering information
on trades, orientation and condition of the opportunities presented on a site
Public Internet;



provide teachers and trainers of future teachers in
As part of their continuous training modules on guidance and
available resources;



incorporate activities promoting knowledge and trades
discovery of the world of work during any schooling and more
especially during the two weeks provided for in Decree
"Missions" to support a true "draft guidance" on 5th and 6th
Secondary;

DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVES TO CREDIBLE REPETITION

Our educational system is one of those most heavily uses the
repetition (46% of students aged 15 in FWB have repeated at least
once against 13% on average in the OECD countries) 15. These
International comparisons show that countries that practice the most
repetition are also those where social reproduction is the
stronger. Repetition generates suffering, generates low self
self and rarely helps fill the difficulties encountered by the student. In
Moreover, its deletion would generate over 420 million (6%
the budget for compulsory education) to strengthen support for
students, the immediate remediation of learning difficulties and taking
individualized load. Yet the current situation and measures taken in
direction from a ten year indicate that it is not enough to declare the non-
repetition. To end this culture of repetition, teachers
must have credible alternatives allowing all students to acquire
basic knowledge. The PS wants to eliminate repetition wherever it is not
necessary and appropriate.
1.4.1. Supporting initiatives "Safe classes" and "schools
Safe "
The PS supports the initiatives of "safe classes" and "free schools
failure "that some school partners and local actors have implemented or
intend to undertake in the near future.
This alternative - which needs to be supervised and evaluated - should not be
ignored since many education systems in Europe are already developing
artwork.
PS proposes to:


hire 1,000 new teachers to organize and remediation
assign them priority in schools that are committed to the fight against
academic failure and grade repetition.
1.4.2. Identify student difficulties

Teachers are often faced with the difficulty of identifying the causes of
Student dysfunctions in learning and develop
appropriate methods to allow them to progress. The error is part of
learning process. The teacher should be able to use to enable
the student to adjust his work.
15

114

The PS wants to:


focus in the initial and continuing training for teachers on
Error analysis and approximations of students on knowledge of
problems in learning and the construction and use of
educational tracks to alleviate it;



promote the exchange of practices between teachers allowing students
to overcome the difficulties they face (development
companionships between teachers, provision of resources
Site enseignant.be ...);



develop an accompaniment in small groups to clarify
difficulties encountered by the student.
1.4.3. Strengthen remedial devices

The immediate remediation and building devices offer students
struggling a different approach to the matter. These additional means are
effective when focused on the times when the student begins its
stall. The teacher must be in his class, the first speaker in
remediation. It must therefore be equipped to adapt its own practice, but
must also be able to bring the problem with his team
colleagues, PMS or outsider center.
The PS wants to:


hold a directed study time free for all students in
every primary school;



generalize the accompanying individualized plan for each student;



support teaching practices that allow such two
consolidate their class teachers to organize activities
differentiated, or another teacher to come in for support
a few hours ;



develop new forms of collective taking charge of
remediation in schools, including through partnerships with
CPMS, therapists and speech therapists;



set up mentoring mechanisms between advanced students and
lower within the same class, and between levels of students
different;



create and distribute software and specific educational applications



amplify the tutoring experiments in which education students
higher (university and non-university) students in frame
compulsory education with learning difficulties in the image of
Schola ULB;



ensure the organization of a directed study, available to everyone, in every
school.
115

1.4.4. Develop tools to fight against failure
To bring each student to overcome his learning difficulties, the teacher is
encouraged to develop learning activities adapted to capacity
each. For the PS, we must support the creation and dissemination of tools for
support teachers in taking into account the diversity of students
and individual learning modalities.
PS proposes to:


support the creation, distribution and use of textbooks
are genuine reference tools;



evaluate the financial support measures taken so far to publishers;



enhance the productions of teachers and researchers
FWB particular by www.enseignement.be website and in the magazine
"Teachers";



develop and disseminate specific tools to manage the difference
level in the classroom.
1.4.5. Involve and motivate students

The work at school and the fight against school failure are also a matter of
motivation and well-being at school. It also appears that anxiety about
certain substances can influence the acquisition of knowledge. This is particularly
If, as shown in the latest PISA 2012 mathematics.
Motivation of students throughout the school is a job
complex that can not be improvised. This particularly requires the involvement of
Students in the school life and the learning process. Working in
team to change the relationship between student and teacher, is
also a relevant lever. Interdisciplinarity, coupled with pedagogy
project, gives meaning to learning. Similarly, cutting the course in
During groups, modularization, must allow students to project
in short, medium and long term prospects.
The PS wants to:


support the organization of modules promoting or maintaining motivation
of students in initial and continuing teacher training;



evaluating experiences modularization launched during this legislature
and adapt these experiences to a generalization, if this proves
timely;



give teachers the means to prevent anxiety of pupils
continuing education offering solutions on registers
psychological (encouragement, confidence building, feedback-oriented
approaches) and educational;



encourage the participation of students in schools either by
active participation in the development of internal regulations, to
organizing projects and participatory activities, or support
116

establishment of student delegates from the 5th primary.
1.4.6. Developing tutoring after school
The PS will be careful to ensure that support for struggling students is not relegated
outside of school. The use of paid tutoring only
reinforce inequalities in access to knowledge.
The PS proposes to:


hold a directed study time free for all students in
every primary school;



involved voluntarily pensioners teachers and students
in the upper offer tutoring at local level;



encourage schools to have initiatives in neighborhoods;



regulate private and commercial initiatives taken proposing
in charge of the duties.

1.5.

ANSWERS TO MAKE CHILDREN NEEDS

Some students have special educational needs. For all children
are entitled to grow and develop to their full capacity
learning, their specific requirements must be taken into account
either integration into mainstream education or in education
specialized according to the needs identified.
PS is responsible for the establishment of an individualized system
flexible support for every stage of life needs of students
specific. The PS also wants to promote maximum integration of these
children in mainstream education and, if necessary, to adapt or improve
existing devices.
Beyond the availability of school infrastructure, the PS proposes to:


make logistical adjustments such as courses translated into Braille,
the use of audio and ICT (access course notes
on computers adapted for visually impaired students, applications
Specific, followed courses by email in case of prolonged absence ...) the
presence of a sign language translation or a personal assistant ...;



adapt teaching methodologies and pedagogies and
evaluations, including training of teachers in language
signs and interpreter training in sign language;



provide statutory recognition of specific functions to the sector
special education.

In addition, the PS wants:


extend the organization of the type of education 8 first degree of
Secondary;
117



offering students the suitable teaching a course Type 8
language to facilitate their integration into the regular high;



adapting initial training by better information for future
teachers, who will all be asked to integrate young people at
disabilities in education "ordinary";



guarantee at least a course in special education during the
initial teacher education;



train teachers to better identify children with dyslexia,
Disorders of attention (ADD) and Attention Deficit Disorders
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and organize a dialogue on this
problems between teachers and parents;



improve the fight against dropping out of school for students with disabilities
severe behavior by school structures using the
socialization (SSAS);



implement a quality support for students affected
a multiple disability or autism situation;



assess the orientation procedure to special education (type
8 in particular) in order to validate the relevance.

1.6.

FIGHT STALL

Too many young people are dropping out of situation. Too many young people leave school
without a diploma. The impact on the future of these young people are enormous.
Unemployment, insecurity, social exclusion or delinquency meet more
often in young people without qualifications. Absenteeism can be physical. But he
can also be more discreet when the student is physically present but
is "elsewhere". Many students feel demotivated due to incorrect
orientation or difficult for them to perceive the meaning of learning. They
fail to invest in their education while being very present in
class. The risk of failure and diploma without output is greatest.
1.6.1. ENCOURAGE "SCHOOL PERSEVERANCE"
Instead of hooking school, Quebecers speak of "perseverance
School ", a concept that incorporates the notion of effort but also to well-being at
work. Accompanying educational teams in prevention and
resolution dropout and school violence problems they encounter
is a priority of the PS. Attention will be paid to the involvement of teams
in educational dropout situations, promoting contacts
between the schools and PMS centers. If there is no miracle solution, the PS
convinced that it is possible to improve learning conditions and,
hence the success of students by developing a holistic approach where
the teacher, the educational team does not remain alone. The importance of partnerships
is fundamental.
Many initiatives of prevention and fight against school dropout
have been implemented in recent years: school attachment Service
(SAS), school attachment device (DAS) in the Brussels-Capital Region,
school mediation, collaborative arrangements between schools, centers psycho118

medical social and youth welfare services, methodologies based on
internal support process (PIA), mobile teams. The fight against
dropout requires a collective effort of all stakeholders. The PS wants
strengthen, after evaluation, devices that are most effective. A
attention will be paid to the interest of appropriate facilities to accommodate them
pupils temporarily excluded, to accompany them during the time
Exclusion (the lack of awareness, project development ...).
The PS defends:


Evaluation of the existing devices and optionally conversion;



the establishment of a coordinated plan for the fight against dropping out between
regional and community stakeholders, as part of the warranty
young people ;



sensitization of parents and bylaws uniformisationdes
institutions to better fight against absenteeism;



the realization of a practical guide to the prevention and identification of
stall which will be broadcast in schools;



the information school players in the role and interest of the devices
Mediation and hooking existing school-wide each basin;



the organization of a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the phenomena

rural areas ;



the organization of a consultation with the municipal administration
concerned to address absenteeism and non-registration of children
and young people of compulsory school age.

The graduating from upper secondary education certificate (CESS) is
essential, including for students who have opted for a qualifying industry.
For the PS, the FWB must ensure, including through campaigns
awareness of students and teachers, to highlight the importance of
End of secondary education (CESS), essential passport to employment,
especially in qualifying courses.
In addition, the PS wants to take into account the specific needs of students
High potentials:


being aware that they can develop their potential remaining
integrated in their school environment.

COMBAT VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS

A secure connection allows each student to learn in the best
conditions. The educational teams must be in a position to meet the
situations of violence whether physical or verbal, against a
student or teacher. Educational teams must be enclosed for
respond more adequately to these situations and look at a faster
School serene climate for the welfare of all.
The PS wants to:


2. S OUTENIR, VALO RISER AND MOTIVATE TEACHERS
Teaching is one of the best jobs ... But it's a tough job.
More than a third of young teachers leave their profession during the first
years of practice. According to a study récente16 these dropouts have
mainly held during the first year. And, moreover,
Many teachers are in short supply functions. These dropouts are due
by recruitment conditions, the multiplication of interims, lack
support early career, stress function, but also
skills of these young people that allow them to apply elsewhere.
Yet teachers are the cornerstone of the functioning of our
schools. Governments need to provide teachers with the means to
do their job in good conditions. The promotion of the profession
teaching is a necessary condition for the mobilization of
educational community in order to allow each child to make the
maximum its potential.
The PS wants the teaching profession again become attractive to the fight against
teacher shortage. Teachers must be able to rely on making
available the means necessary to perform the tasks which are theirs.
Throughout their career, they should receive support, advice and

position on the labor market, Cahiers du GIRSEF, in April 2013.

120

educational, human and material resources that enable them to respond
the difficulties encountered in the classroom.
The PS proposes to work on several levels: initial and continuing training
teachers, conditions of engagement and early career
accompanying early career, the fight against scarcity,
boosting careers and their development or improvement
working conditions in schools.
2.1.

REFOUNDING TEACHER EDUCATION AND THAT OF THEIR TRAINING

During this parliamentary term, broad consultation was carried out on reform
Initial teacher training for assessing the quality of the current training
Teachers first, and, secondly, to identify the interests of the actors themselves for training in 5 years.
This evaluation was conducted with all stakeholders. All the
world agrees on today: the training of teachers - and
mirror, their trainers, should be reviewed to contribute more to
development of a more just school, democratic and emancipatory for
all.
The objectives and content of the training must be adjusted, the
stringent requirements. If differentiated courses should be devised, and
guarded specificities, the new training structure must be thought in 5 years
for everyone. In addition, the PS will be attentive to what dimension practice
especially in the scientific record of the initial training is strengthened.
The implementation of this reform in the next Parliament will certainly be
one of the most important measures and the greatest potential effect
multiplier.
To implement the findings of this consultation, the PS wants to:


implement teacher training in 5 years, which is inscribed
strongly in the new higher education landscape,
enhancing synergies and collaborations (or co-graduations) between
training institutions;



establish a continuing training system for trainers
teachers;



continue the initiated participatory dynamic.

In terms of continuing training, the PS wants to:


revitalize teacher training in close articulation
with the reform of initial training;



refocus continuing education on the most in tune with the topics
Daily teachers and better able to support their
work;
121



supporting co-training devices, between master teachers
training, trainers, educationalists, researchers.

2.2.

ADAPT TERMS OF APPOINTMENT

Enter the teaching career is not easy. Before being appointed, is
often the obstacle course, the uncertainty of being taken over from year to year
the other, to share between several establishments or establishments ... In these
conditions, it is sometimes difficult to stay motivated. The PS wants to facilitate entry
in the teaching career and enable new teachers to deploy
best ability, motivation in the classroom.
2.2.1. BETTER SUPPORT FOR TEACHERS IN EARLY CAREER
To better support young teachers, the PS wants to:


develop a support program where young teachers
Candidate educational teams submit a project allowing them
receiving the support of young teachers;



organize a fellowship of young teachers by a teacher
more experienced;



standard design courses, accessible to all teachers as a basis



organize educational coaching sessions with all new
Teachers within each institution;



focus the ongoing training of young teachers on the difficulties
Specific encountered during the first years of teaching.
2.2.2. REVIEW THE TERMS OF HIRING

On conditions for hiring, PS wishes:


standardize procedures to apply as a teacher;



wage scale simplify rules in connection with the
simplification of regulations on the required securities;



standardize the appointment procedures to speed up the process
appointment and offer prospects for new teachers
faster stabilization and define services that lead futures
specific to a permanent appointment.
2.2.3. STABILIZATION AS SOON NEW TEACHERS

The PS also intends to change the rules for awarding course loads
to stabilize the labor market outcomes of young teachers:


shorten the period of allocation of positions in early and simplify
the allocation procedures;



analyze the impact of priority rules on hiring new
122

teachers;


coordinating supply and demand positions at the basin in
internetwork.

2.3.

BOOSTING THE TEACHING CAREER

The teaching career still offers too little development prospects. The PS
think we must provide diversification opportunities that allow
maintain the motivation of teaching staff while using the best
the experience and skills of teachers.
The PS wants to:


expand further recognition and better use experience

acquired in compliance with existing statutes and in compliance with
educational and pedagogical projects of the organizing authorities
(eg respect for the neutrality of formal education).

2.4.

FIGHT TEACHER SHORTAGE

The shortage of teachers is currently limited to certain disciplines and
certain areas of the FWB. However, the age structure coupled to the boom
population will lead to an increase in demand need
anticipating. The schools with the most vulnerable groups suffer
123

more teacher shortages. We must provide incentives for
encourage the commitment of teachers and the stability of educational teams.
In addition to the support measures for young teachers, the PS offers
of:


campaigns to improve the image of the teaching profession;



create a device to facilitate short-term replacements or
Another formula to meet the challenges faced by
educational teams when a teacher is absent;



amplify and collaborations with Forem Actiris and promote
career shifts into teaching;



allowing the delivery and overtime pay beyond the maximum time slot;



allow the staff member benefiting from measures
of retirement planning (SIPD) who so request
resume operations;



generalize the opportunity to continue his career beyond age 65
members of voluntary staff.

2.5.

IMPROVE WORKING CONDITIONS

The PS wants to develop the business of teaching and improve their
of work. He wishes :


better define the burden of



strengthen the teaching team work and promoting the work
interdisciplinary;



develop shared responsibility;



3. P ROMOTING SCHOOL INCLUSIVE EXCELLENCE COMBINING,
GOOD MANAGEMENT AND IBE N - BE
The PS wants to raise the level of student performance and reduce inequalities
academic achievement. The school must be inclusive but develop
devices suitable for all, as any had need. This inclusive school
will be the work of all. It is therefore essential for the PS to support directions,
educational teams by giving them the autonomy to adapt to
best practices and optimize the use of resources to meet the challenges
educational, demographic of our educational system.

124

3.1.

SUPPORT DIRECTIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM

The head is a centerpiece in the functioning of a
school. It is the real driver both in terms of pedagogy provided in its
establishment in the management and development of projects,
animation team and school culture. There is also a link
essential in the implementation of harmonious relations between
teachers, parents and students.
To perform this function, directors must receive the support and
training needed to be efficient managers of their establishment.
To strengthen support for directions, the PS wants to:


study the possibility of simplifying administrative tasks through eGovernment;



develop digital tools adapted to directions;



provide coaching and organizing exchange of good practices
management within the same school area;



adapt-career training of principals to
they have a solid management training and they
become true "learning managers".

But the directions need to be backed by a team for functions
cross.
To ensure administrative and organizational support, the PS wants to:


ensure the stability of teaching staff, including the
management;



strengthen collaboration between institutions for sharing
administrative resources;



provide administrative assistance to the fundamental directions.

3.2.

ENCOURAGING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT TEACHING TEAMS

Schools enjoy considerable autonomy. It allows
educational teams met, taking into account specific realities,
objectives assigned by the education system in the acquisition of
skills.
For the PS, the necessary autonomy of schools is accompanied by a
accountability of the different actors of education in logic
regulation and control. The educational system and its individual components
fall since the early 2000s in a driving dynamics
by objectives with the development of external evaluations, implementation
from support when the objectives are not achieved or
the organization of supply basins in school.
125

Schools and educational teams must be able to make the adjustments
necessary to ensure the best learning conditions for their
students in the local context, together with other
institutions in their area. Institutional autonomy should be regulated
collectively within the establishment, by the teaching staff.
To develop excellence in each institution, the PS wants:


each school can initiate an action plan according to the project
of establishment, the educational project;



each management or administrative body has autonomy of action
necessary to define the action plan in consultation with the team
particularly with regard to educational results of students
External evaluations organized by the Ministry of FWB;



This plan is developed with the support of educational advisors;



the realization of this plan be evaluated by the General Inspection Service.

For institutions whose students are lasting results below
the expected results, the PS proposes to:


establish a specific redeployment plan based on
needs of each institution, and with a device dedicated to
remediation and the fight against dropping out of school;



grant incentives and guarantee employment to teaching teams
establishments that fall into this redeployment logic;



provide support and assess the results by
university teams.

3.3.

PROVIDING QUALITY FRAMEWORK

For the PS, students as educational teams should enjoy
optimal material conditions.
The PS wants to be:


adapting physical standards of school buildings to take
Account pedagogical developments;



integrate space requirements of the collective work of the teaching staff
in the renovation of school buildings;



coordinating programming internship places deals with supply
education to ensure each student's educational choices;



ask the European level the reduced VAT rates on
school buildings 21-6%;



propose a coordinated management policy for school buildings
the FWB, public corporations administration of school buildings
(SPABS and SPABSC);

126



invest in building maintenance to avoid renovations
more expensive and subsequent search for a specific financing with
the European Investment Bank;



promote the inclusion of social clauses, environmental and ethical
for the construction or renovation of school buildings;



incorporate energy efficiency criteria in
renovation or construction of school buildings.

the

Project

MEET THE NEEDS RELATED TO DEMOGRAPHIC BOOM

Under this term, € 1.25 billion was spent on the creation of
nearly 25,000 new school places. The effort is important but
should be continued in order to respond fully to the effects of boom
population. The challenge is important. By 2020, there will be 25,000 students and more
in our schools. There must also be an opportunity to further meet expectations
parents.
The PS intends to continue monitoring needs in education, consecutive to
demographic trends, given the existing supply, based on a
Maps of places available and the needs identified. These needs
the buildings but also the commitment of teachers, the acquisition of
appropriate equipment and the renewal of the educational offer.
PS proposes to:


create and maintain a register of availability crossed with
needs to objectify the selection of school infrastructure projects;



lead and coordinate the creation of school places and ensure
strict monitoring of the implementation of planned places;



facilitate the reallocation of public land and property reserves
not used to meet the need for school places;



rebalance school provision throughout the territory of the FWB and
give priority to the creation of additional places in areas
experiencing the highest population growth rates;



redeploy the educational project of the least acclaimed schools
better meet the expectations of parents and students;



strengthen partnership with the actors of employment and training to
to respond to the phenomena of teacher shortage.

Increasing the number of places is, for the PS, an opportunity to develop
a teaching offer that meets the demands of more students and
parents.
The PS is favorable that these facilities offer:


of mobilizing pedagogies, inclusive and innovative, including
immersion;



general and polytechnic core lying in the extension
127

primary education;


new qualification options responding to new opportunities
society and the labor market.

3.5.

DEVELOP THE TIME SCHOOL FOR WELFARE OF ALL

School is a place of learning and a place of life. School time should be
redesigned to accommodate more children rhythms, promote their
wellness and improve learning conditions.
PS proposes to:


study the advisability of reorganizing the timing of school holidays
to better take into account the pace of the students;



redevelop the daily schedule taking into account, as far as
possible, own rhythms at each age.

A study by the League of families, 49% of parents express
perceived lack of time, which generates stress for 71% of them.
School time should be thought to include the duties and activities
sporting and creative in order to offer an educational consistency throughout the
school day. We need to take into account all the needs of
the child or young person, at different times of the day and throughout
the school year.
For the PS, the bulk of school work must be done at school. It is a way
to ensure equality of opportunity for knowledge is also support parents
working in reconciling work and private life. A
management of quality must be ensured in partnership with stakeholders
school care, culture and sports.
The PS wants to:


generalize the free care of children until the fundamental
18h without lengthening the number of course hours and by including a
supervised study time for the student has the opportunity to make his
duties in optimal conditions.

The PS also proposes to:


supervise and encourage the organization of directed studies for at least
one hour after the end of the course;



promote the implementation of the method
teaching "in voluntary schools;



invest in training of qualified individuals to supervise
Children's lunch time or after school;



expand the supply of duty of schools, as academic support and
key player in the school-family relations;



PROMOTING WELLNESS AT SCHOOL
3.6.1. OFFER HEALTHY EATING AND ACCESSIBLE

The school is a living place, where certain behaviors are acquired as
eating habits. The school must facilitate access for all to food
healthy health, balanced, diversified and quality.
The PS will be careful to ensure that school canteens have an offer
Food respecting nutritional recommendations for public health,
to contribute to the improvement of the health of the population. The
children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds being the most affected by the
overweight and obesity, the food supply in schools is an element
important in the fight against social inequalities in health. In addition, too
children do not enjoy every day a hot meal.
The PS proposes in particular (see also chapter Health) to:


offer each child, free hot meals and balanced in
all primary schools;



develop in terms of infrastructure and opportunities
Outsourcing of each school partnerships with schools
qualifications which have a food section or with kitchens
collective over the entity or school area;



integrating a majority of local food or season, or from
organic farming and fair trade;



distribute, for the morning snack, a fruit per day for each child.

The emphasis in favor of healthy and affordable food will be on schools
welcoming the less privileged public.
3.6.2. ENCOURAGE THE SPORT PRACTICE AT SCHOOL
The PS wants the school to be an opportunity to get a taste for practical
Sports students with an overview of the range of different sports.
It is also the opportunity to get students to perpetuate a sport
outside and after school.
The PS wants to include (see also Chapter Sport):


review the "Physical Education" core competences that define the
basic skills that students should acquire;



offer the student a discovery of different sports to
encourage them to play sports;



encourage collaboration between local sports clubs and schools;
129



encourage physical education teachers to play an active role in
detection and referral of students for the sport outside of school;



create a "sports school" label rewarding schools that meet
several quality criteria for sport;



actively support access to sports school infrastructure
outside the normal usage time, including through
devices integrated local sports centers.

3.7.

INCREASING SYNERGIES CULTURE AND EDUCATION

There is no education without culture. This is why the FWB adopted Decree
"Culture-School" in 2006. It strengthens the links between the two sectors and
perpetuates the activities that have proven themselves, while encouraging in to
new. The PS wants to put culture in the educational path of each
child.
The PS proposes in particular (see also Chapter Culture) from:


encourage partnerships to ensure student access,
during his school career, culture and different forms of
creation and artistic expression;



establish a check "Culture at School" for schools
welcoming the most disadvantaged groups in
to finance the
participation in a cultural event;



strengthen partnerships and synergies between compulsory and
Artistic secondary education reduced hours;



develop partnerships with academies
toy libraries and other cultural sites;



promote, in partnership with the academies, the creation of courses
artistic practices in basic education.

STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF PARENTS IN DYNAMIC EDUCATIONAL

Parents and families play a key role in the schooling of their
children. They are full participants in the education system. To create
a real dynamic around the student, it is important that parents are
in connection with the educational team. The dialogue-school families is fundamental
to give birth in the family a positive attitude vis-à-vis the school and
favorable climate study.
PS proposes to:


support accompanying projects of parents in monitoring the
education of their children in a perspective of co-education;



fostering partnerships with literacy associations
Learning the French language in order to strengthen
Skills parents do not speak French in supporting the
education of their child;
130



form, as part of their initial and further training, the
Teachers diversity;



mobilize directions so that is created, under Decree
"Parent associations" from each school, an association of
parents



improve synergies between teaching teams and staff
Home relying on the essential role that welcoming es play
after school that are often the most regular contact between the school and
the parents ;



support the initiatives of associations fighting against dropping
School and improve dialogue between these associations, schools and
families;



one day a year organize an open door to allow
new parents to visit schools.

4. V ISER The E Galite ACQUIRED
Inequalities between students remain significant. The gap between the most schools
strong and the weak is more important than the average of OECD countries.
The same goes for differences in social background of students.
For the PS, it is important to act at the earliest and on all the levers, both financial
or educational and organizational, to improve the fairness of our system
education. The aim is obviously not a race to the bottom. The PS wants
the school offers the appropriate means to ensure that all children can succeed
at school, according to their needs, without social or cultural discrimination.
4.1.

ENCOURAGING SCHOOL ATTENDANCE EARLIEST

Regular attendance of school as early as possible is a success factor
for the continuation of schooling. The PS proposes to encourage families to enroll in
school their children at school from two and a half. For children whose
French is not the language spoken at home and, more generally, for
the most distant world public school, attendance is at the earliest
the opportunity to become familiar with the school code and learn the language
education before academic learning really begins.
To encourage parents to enroll their children at school from two and a
half, the PS proposes to:


systematically organize open days in schools
and to focus on welcoming families of new students;



organize, during each school year, all schools, a
meeting between parents and teachers in order to clarify it, in the
a dialogue that reflects the level of information of parents,
expectations vis-à-vis school for parents and children;



organize accompanying parents at spaces
nursery education;
131



make parents aware of the importance, both for the child itself that
for the good organization of educational activities, a
regular attendance in kindergarten;



develop linkages between early childhood structures and
school including the training of childcare professionals.

In addition, the PS wants to make compulsory school attendance from 5
years. This obligation is all the more essential that the organization in
5-8 cycles become widespread. Early school attendance promotes
integration in school and hence student achievement. In areas
demographic pressure, all access to nursery education must be
Guaranteed.
To ensure educational continuity between kindergarten and third
first two years of primary school, the PS wants to:


mandating enrollment of children from 5 years and provide
intermediary phases in order to fit the needs in terms
infrastructure to make registration mandatory in the medium term
children from 3 years.

4.2.

LOWER SCHOOL FEES FOR PARENTS

Our Constitution provides that access to education is free until the end
compulsory education. This basic principle is also enshrined in
various texts of international law. Yet it is clear that
Many expenses are claimed by the schools and the cost of schooling remains
problematic for too many families.
To ensure support of the pupil for the duration of the time
education in basic education, the PS proposes to:


introduce free daycare lunch;



provide free hot meals at noon and balanced students;



set up in each school, after school hours, a study
directed and free, accessible to students who so wish;



offer free daycare in all primary schools.

In addition, the PS wants an assessment of the fees charged to students in
all schools in the FWB and better regulation of these. The decree
regulates participation in school trips and scenery will also
assessed and, where appropriate, as amended.
To reduce school fees for families, the PS proposes to:


create a central purchasing at the offering goods FWB
School organizers authorities and schools;



organize a procurement system for schools (heating oil,
132

supplies, services ...) to reduce operating costs
schools.
Each school is able to offer parents receive discounts to
greatly reduce their costs while maintaining the quality of supplies.
The PS also hears:


bring a note from monthly fees taking exhaustively
the fees charged for activities and equipment;



establish a list of equipment needed to use and comprehensive in
courses framework;



to identify, for each school, annual school fees to ensure
cost transparency;



encourage the payment of fees by a bank account for no more
the child involved in financial transactions with the school;



prepare annual ceilings for all school costs including
extracurricular activities and travel;



ensure accessibility of textbooks by promoting their development
Online.

Furthermore, PS means analyze the potential to neutralize the cost of
technical and vocational education, dependent parents, that is to
day more expensive than general secondary education.
Similarly, the PS also wants to ensure free access to culture and
sports for the greatest number, and priority for the
disadvantaged.
The PS wants:


access to academies remains free for children under 12
years and for the most disadvantaged families.

4.3.

IMPROVE THE DECREE "ENTRY"
For the PS, the regulation of entries avoids discrimination
the entry of secondary schools and thus promote a social mix and
improving the performance of each child. This regulation also favors
transparency, putting all students on equal terms for access to
secondary schools.
In recent years, the application of the decree "enrollment" has generated
side effects, which, even if they affect only a minority of families,
must be corrected.
In Brussels, these difficulties are largely amplified by the boom
population. In areas in demographic pressure, the opening of
new school places will therefore be a priority. The PS wants
133

increasing the number of seats is the chance to meet the expectations of
parents and students regarding educational offer. The organization
specially autographed the elongated core institutions will
also privileged.
For the PS, each child must be enrolled in a quality school,
easy access, according to an educational project that matches the expectations of its
parents.
The PS wants to maintain transparency and objectivity of enrollment in a
school. The PS also wants to strengthen the social mix in schools. There
better accessibility for all students in all schools should be guaranteed.
But there can be no question of returning to arbitrariness or to files.
The PS will pay attention to:


strengthen the social mix;



ensuring a transparent and democratic access;



increase the number of seats to ensure a place for every child
that meets the expectations of parents.

4.4.

SUPPORT SCHOOLS THAT FOCUS MOST PUBLIC precarious

The government has implemented mechanisms to support more
those who need it most. These are so-called "discrimination policies
positive "and" differentiated supervision. "
These policies, implemented at the initiative of the PS, used to give more
human and material resources to students who have the least to keep them
equal opportunity to succeed. This was a first response. But we must go
away.
Beyond the human and material resources, these institutions and these teams
teachers who welcome the most disadvantaged must be
supported to rethink their educational project, offering them options ...
PS offers:


the establishment of a specific action plan depending on the needs of
each establishment, taking account of needs identified across
School basin (see above).

PS offers yet:


evaluate differentiated framework policies and funding
differentiated in terms of the objective of social mix and lower
inequalities;



extend, where appropriate, the population while increasing
progressivity of funding based on socio-economic and socio-cultural students;
134



encourage experienced teachers to work in schools where
focused educational and social difficulties;



smoothing the granting of available hours (capital period and total number of
Professor periods) and calculating the financial resources of institutions
in time, to limit the pressure in the recruitment of students by
schools and competition between institutions.

5. V ALORISER The SEIGNEMENT QUALIFIED IN ANT
For many youth, qualifying education (technical and vocational)
is not a positive choice, but a default choice, after failures
repeated in the general. Qualifying courses not yet have nothing to envy
general programs. They are, also, real opportunities
employment, development, social integration and future.
For the PS, our educational system must operate to propose a revolution
positive integration in the qualifying. The PS wants to give flavor to sectors
qualifications, making them valued and rewarding sectors. It first passes
through better information, promotional work and pathways to qualifications
of qualifying trades. It is also the creation or redirecting streams
to the trades shortage or high technical added value. It is still
lessons really in tune with the realities of trades taught.
Finally, it is an overhaul of the organization of qualifying integrating alternation.
5.1.

INFORM ON SECTORS qualifying

Too many teachers in primary and lower secondary thought
although the orientation of their students in qualifying is a failure. The
Students should be encouraged and supported in their choices by information
realistic (including the requirements and opportunities) that underpins the sector
they have chosen. Parents are important players for choosing
sectors but unfortunately most parents today do not have
objective information (supply, opportunities, chosen sector / industry suffered ...).
Finally, it must also involve the companies to participate in
rebranding these trades.
To enhance the image of technical and manual trades, the PS offers:


the organization, in collaboration with the educational and qualifying
professional sectors, briefings 5th teachers
and 6th primary and extended core;



organizing competitions such as World Skills and
supporting young participants WorldSkills and media coverage
these events;



the annual village-business organization, allowing students to
discover and try out the technical and manual trades in
each school basin;



the implementation of a positive focus on integrating information
prerequisites and opportunities of the proposed sectors;
135



the conclusion of sectoral agreements with companies at
each basin about recovery and occupational information;



the business involvement in Liege Cities and Trades
Charleroi to promote contact with the reality of young trades
Technical and Technological such qu'exercés in companies.

5.2.

RETHINKING THE PROCESS OF ORIENTATION QUALIFIER

The PS wants to review the orientation process to avoid orientations
negative in qualifying. It offers:


develop projects facilitating the discovery of qualifying trades
during the elongated core;



provide an observation internship and / or center
competence at the entrance of qualifying courses (which will present 4th Technical
or professional) to sharpen the choice in the prosecution of the sector
qualifying.

5.3.

REALLY OFFERING LESSONS IN LINE WITH THE REALITIES
BUSINESS TAUGHT

The economic and social actors denounce the gap between content
lessons in vocational programs and the requirements of socio-economic world. Education should keep the ambition to train citizens to
Similarly, as stated in the "Missions" decree "to take an active role
in the economic, social and cultural. " For PS, next to a stem
common box, the calling instruction must provide training in line with
the expected skills in professional sectors.
5.3.1. REORGANIZE THE EDUCATIONAL OFFER QUALIFIER
The PS wants to:


generalize at least one "professionalizing" experience in
qualifying courses and gradually transform the current 3rd degree
Professional alternately starting with the careers of the future or
shortage;



review the offer of options in technical and vocational courses for
no longer die distinction but identify groups of
crafts;



a core set of common core competencies to all sections
including qualifying mastery of written and spoken French, notions
management, learning a second language;



organize language courses oriented "business";



adapt more, throughout the technical sector, said current
"General" to the realities of business;



expand the secondary school test than alternation;

136



convert pathways that offer no outlet or professional
possibility of further study;



ensure that the company properly plays its part by training
conclusion of sectoral agreements that determine an internship quota
basin and sector;



strengthen the links between education and qualifying sections
advanced technology centers (CTA), the centers of competence (CoC)
and reference centers (CDRs) in each basin
training.

This reorganization will form part of the continued modularisation
of qualifying courses. The "modular" organization allows to leave the
logic of "all or nothing" and contributes to the fight against school failure. The offer
modularized can leverage the benefit of all and at all stages
of life, opportunities to acquire, to recognize and validate
skills to the full development in society. It should also
provide assurance of the labor market.
The PS wants to:


evaluating experiences modularization, particularly with regard to
the repetition reduction target;



broaden the current experiences of new jobs, if any;



modularization organize related training organized by
Regions in order to promote the passage of sectors 'teaching' to
chains 'vocational training' in to validate
skills acquired at each stage.
5.3.2. DEVELOPING EDUCATION ALTERNATED

Alternating training provides skills for party
school or training center, partly enterprise,
alternating times and training locations.
For the PS, the work and training should be recognized as a die
excellence. It should even be gradually expanded to the entire
vocational education, starting with areas related to business
future shortage or. The alternation must enable young people to acquire the
technical, social and labor necessary to insert
directly on the labor market.
Alternation allows is a win - win partnership:
 for the young who must come out "equipped" to get a job
sustainable and quality;
 for the corporate world which, through this, will have access to a potential
skills that businesses need to remain competitive;
 for operators where synergies with the world
allow the company to enrich and improve the quality of their
training and teaching.
137

The rapid implementation of the reform of alternation will be a priority
next legislature to avoid competition that sometimes exists between
youth and between operators.
For the PS, the development of alternation will including the creation
OFFA of the French Office of alternating training, joint management.
The PS will pay attention to:


realize the unique status of the young alternately, in consultation with
the social partners, regardless of operator training;



strengthen, in a logic of articulation and complementarity, the
bridges and synergies between operators;



Business harmonize approval procedures of partners

5.3.3. SCHOOLS PROVIDE MODERN EQUIPMENT

The equipment of schools is an important lever for that training
qualifications are in line with the reality of the working world. The
in terms of equipment investment must organize from
collaborations between networks and stay focused in order to create a mass effect
critical to ensure modern equipment and quality.
PS proposes to:


Maps update the equipment;



specialize the provision of education institutions according to the offer
of equipment available and the needs identified in each
School basin;



consider whether to create a city of trades per school pool
based on a cross-network collaboration to mutualise
equipment and premises available to students.
5.3.4. STRENGTHENING CENTRES ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES (CTA)

The 31 advanced technology centers (CTA) in the territory of the FWB
were initiated by socialist ministers. They offer training
qualifying and put advanced equipment available to students and
teachers, and job seekers and workers. Organized
from the FWB, they always are in a school. They are
available to all networks. ACTs are supported Regions and
sectors, allowing a real basis in reality the sectors, a
continuous updating tools and training materials and adaptation
the supply of both fast training and the requests of
the labor market.
Given the interest of schools for the CTA, the PS wants to:


consolidate the device and better adjust to the needs of schools;



strengthen the use of CTA by schools and open to more
jobseekers ;



strengthen the inter-network dimension and guarantee an offer on each
School pool in connection with the changing needs of the latter;



negotiate with the sectoral social partners private investment
in the CTA;



decide whether to grant the CTA label to other infrastructure
School with advanced equipment and make it as
accessible to jobseekers.

139

5.3.5. BUILDING ON PARTNERSHIP WITH JURISDICTION AND THE CENTRES
REFERENCE CENTRES

Competence centers and reference centers offer training
specialized by industry and advanced equipment. The first are the result
partnerships between Wallonia, FOREM, IFAPME, social partners
professional sectors, research and universities. By Region
Brussels, reference centers are the result of a partnership between
Actiris, Bruxelles-Formation and the social partners.
The PS wants to:


maximizing, with the regions, investments in centers
competence and referral centers;



increase attendance centers by the schools;



strengthen links between regional initiatives and education and
organize complementarities with technology centers
advanced.
5.3.6. BUILDING CONSISTENCY BETWEEN LESSONS AND REALITIES
JOBS

For the PS, the training of teachers working in qualifying courses
must be underpinned by continued training specifically based on
specific to their industry realities. Links between teachers and industry
professional each sector should be developed.
In terms of teacher training, the PS proposes to:


support additional specific continuing education proposals
for teachers of qualifying, from profiles "business" and
training profiles;



encourage the organization of conversion to other modules
disciplines and / or disciplines "emerging";



promote awareness of teachers at the end of primary and
core elongated secondary to the knowledge of trades and
qualification courses;



develop training organized in partnership with the Forem or
Brussels-training and the sectoral social partners;



strengthen training for new equipment and technologies
Information and communication.

In collaborating with professionals, the PS will propose:


internships in companies for teachers;



professional interventions in the sectors concerned
classes;



an optimization of the use of resources proposed in the CTA
140

competence centers and reference centers.
5.4.

ADAPT THE OFFER OF OPTIONS TO REALITY OF THE WORLD OF WORK

Currently, some options do not allow students to find a
employment, while, in addition, some areas are desperately short of labor force. According to the PS, we must offer students a motivating trajectory
enrolling in a qualifying education job carrier dynamics.
The basin management, organized under this legislature should be boosted to
improve phasing education provision with the expectations of
students and their families and labor market needs.
The PS wants to:


deepen the reorganization of supply basin according to the expectations
students and families, needs and opportunities of the market
employment, in consultation with stakeholders and partners of qualifying
social;



strengthen synergies with the Regions by including better
Communication of job offers, including in the territories
Border to Wallonia and Brussels.

5.5.

STRENGTHENING THE CONSULTATION BETWEEN THE SCHOOL AND THE ECONOMIC WORLD

The importance of a shared future vision of the contribution of education
economic issues and ways to promote the integration of young people is
demonstrated. We must be able to anticipate the creation of new jobs,
updating the skills expected constantly seen developments
rapid technology in each of the training courses. Consultation
covers both the objectives and the definition of golf
training, definition of supply and territorial development based on
business profiles and training profiles of the Francophone Trades and Service
qualifications (SFMQ).
For the PS, you must resume the dynamics of contracting, initiated
previously under the Contract for school, to build
together with all stakeholders, school fair, efficient and
quality.
5.6.

UP REFORM OF QUALIFYING IN THE PROCESS OF EUROPEAN
REFORM OF EDUCATION AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING

The Copenhagen Declaration provides the basis for harmonizing
education and vocational training. It sets up a system
at European level for the mobility of a national system to another, but
also from one operator to another. The advantage of the approach is to promote
continuation and escalation learning pathways for citizens.

141

The PS will pay attention to:


continue the listing of these reforms at the regional level and
FWB;



preserve the specific features of our system which have been proven.

6. CCOMPAGNER THE SCHOOL S FOR MORE EQUAL
The school no longer distinguish the best students by separating and excluding
worse. The actors in education must be accompanied in their
autonomy in decision-optimal responsibility. The PS wants to associate
school stakeholders to these changes.
Other countries face similar difficulties, have managed to reform and
validly rebuild their school systems. These changes have been made
over a longer period a legislature. For the PS, we need to ensure
continuity of public action over such a long period. This continuity of
public action requires a strong consensus of all social actors on
the objectives that our education should achieve.
6.1.

SUPPORT AND SUPPORT SCHOOLS

Teaching needs to evolve, to find prospects allowing it
to calmly respond to the challenges that confront him. Reforms are
necessary. But for that to succeed, it is essential to raise
membership, that education stakeholders develop a shared vision of what
that should be a lesson for all.
To bring these changes, it is important to start with and adjust revalidate
priorities in order to identify priority areas for the future. It's about
seamlessly evaluate the initiatives, in close consultation with
trade unions, federations of organizing authorities, parents and
social partners.
The PS wants to initiate a "Pact for Education", involving, for some
aspects, representatives of forces Walloon and Brussels to
analyze the results achieved continuously operated by the reforms and
make the agenda of corrective measures to achieve the
objectives.
This Pact will aim:
 raising the level of student performance and prioritize reduction
the proportion of youth who do not have the skills and
basic knowledge in key subjects (reading, mathematics,
sciences);
 reduction of social inequalities in academic achievement and, through this, to
the dualisation of the school leading to social breakdown.
The PS proposes ambitious targets for reduction in the failure rate,
the dropout rate, increase in graduation rates, improving
results in international tests (both in terms of performance than link
142

between them and the social background of pupils), identifying, in consultation
with actors, how to achieve them.
The PS wants after consultation:


conclude a "Pact for Education" with stakeholders,
involving, in some aspects, representatives of forces
Walloon and Brussels in order to set the objectives of quality and equity
the education system, measures to achieve them, the processes
evaluation of initiatives, terms of continuous readjustment
as well as the mutual commitments of the actors involved.

In order to operationalize this new "Pact for Education", the PS
intends to develop local mechanisms to mobilize capabilities
change field players such pilot projects of great magnitude,
followed by participatory assessments to legitimize reforms.
In addition, the PS will support sectoral dialogue every two years. This
consultation with the education sector has led to many
advanced, affecting all categories of staff in our schools.
The PS wants to continue to make this social dialogue engine changes
education by focusing on the continuous improvement of the framework of
its actors.
6.2.

ARRANGE A CONSULTATION OF THE EDUCATION WORLD

It is necessary to redefine the rules of the game to own school and so
enable teachers to better exercise their pedagogical creativity.
In 2004, a consultation showed that teachers wanted
actively participate in the evolution of the school, they wanted to be involved in
the development of reforms that allow them to meet the challenges of
school.
Ten years later, the PS wants the start of term, organize a new
consulting teachers on the most effective ways to meet
the objectives of quality and equity. This consultation will take place by the end
2014 to quickly launch the projects that will enable players
Education redeploy the resources for best results. Improving
the quality of our educational system will not happen without the full participation
and complete all teachers.
6.3.

DEVELOP A GLOBAL DRIVING THE EDUCATION SYSTEM

Education providers and schools have
historically significant autonomy whatsoever in the management of
the establishment, definition of teaching methods, regulation of offer
teaching ... This autonomy should be strengthened to enable
players to adapt practices to local realities and achieve goals
excellence and equity. The strengthening of this autonomy, however, must go

143

along with greater regulation of the education system and a real
overall management of the education system based on ambitious targets.
This will, PS door for fifteen years with the "Missions" decree
1997, the Steering Committee in 2002, external evaluations not
for certified during the entire school career, the external test
allowing the granting of basic studies certificate (CEB) or reform
inspection during the 2004-2009 term.
The steering enables educational teams, directions, students and
Parents identify the achievements and deficits in order to implement support
adapted. External assessments, for certified or not, each and every cycle
level allow teaching staff to adjust their organization and
propose strategies for learning adapted to the specificities of each
student.
The PS defends increased school autonomy within a framework defined by
the power controller to enable a better adaptation to the needs and
specifics locally.
In addition, the PS is committed to:


strengthen the skills of inter-network Steering Committee
to include the overall management of the supply of places per pond,
harmonizing the status and careers of teachers and the
collection of data on their journey;



evaluate, with university teams, enforcement decrees
"Missions" and "School of success", especially on
methodologies and teaching devices created;



revitalize multiannual plans coordinated Education Research
by the Steering Committee to enhance the production of knowledge
and tools necessary for the control of education;



develop tools that ensure effective governance as
regular assessment of all the measures taken at
each establishment and regular monitoring dashboards
administration and school leaders;



generalize, after secondary education - including
qualifying education - pathways alternating and training, a
upper secondary test to assess on a
same basic control terminal and skills of students
ensure the uniform quality of diplomas.

6.4.

ENSURE CONSISTENT WORK AND OPTIMUM GENERAL SERVICE
INSPECTION

The General Inspection Service is one of the most important tools for
supporting educational teams and ensure proper regulation of the system
education.
It is clear that for two years, lives in a General Service
uncertainty due to the difficulties of recruiting and stabilize teams.
144

The PS intends, at first, solve this problem which has only
too long, offering concrete and stable outlook for the Service
General Inspection.
Secondly, the PS intends to open a reflection on the missions
General Inspection Service and consider his transfer to a body
multidisciplinary professional responsible for ensuring the quality of education
in all schools like what prevails in other
educational systems.
6.5.

STREAMLINE THE LANDSCAPE

To choose which school their child will make his schooling,
Parents have the choice between four establishments education networks
different. This freedom creates competition between networks and between schools,
with a consequent multiplication of educational provision and
additional costs which might usefully be allocated to the fight against school failure.
Especially as this segmentation no longer guarantees a real differentiation
pedagogical and philosophical models.
The experience of recent years shows that the level rise
performance and reducing inequalities face too often
oppositions between networks and between schools.
Beyond the historical and ideological disputes on the existence of several
education networks, the first concern is to improve the PS
quality and equity of our education.
Discussions should now focus on how best to
enable all education stakeholders to participate fully, without
competition, the common objectives of education. For the PS, it is necessary in
First, strengthen reconciliation and collaboration between
institutions at local, inter-networks. The decree "School basins"
offers supply management in this mode for the qualifying education.
This is a first step.
This intermediary organization on a territorial basis should be extended to all
teaching. For the PS, we must, at the supra-local level, targeting an offer
education and training and coordinated and complementary to
Place a logic of dialogue between players and management for
accompany school accountability.
In this new framework, the Regions have a key role to play. To
heart of the definition and implementation of recovery strategies
socioeconomic, their immediate contact with the ground, their direct link
with the provinces and municipalities and their skills
training and professional integration make actors Regions
essential for the success of a future education in Wallonia and
Brussels.
Finally, the PS will be attentive to strengthen synergies between the powers
the official organizers (municipal, provincial, and Cocof FWB), on base
voluntary, so the best use of available resources and improve
145

the organization of schools serving students (ie. easy replacement
absent teachers ...).

146

HIGHER EDUCATION
In 50 years, higher education has changed its purpose and practices. From
formation of an economic and social elite, it has also become an instrument of
social justice. Higher education has become an instrument
social ascension. Higher education in Wallonia-Brussels
is quality, the most accessible. It must remain so. For fifteen years,
higher education has changed dramatically to enroll in
European dynamic of Bologna. We must now ensure stabilization
the frame and secure in place of each institution in a redefined landscape.
The recent reform of the higher education landscape led by
Socialist further improves its accessibility by ensuring close
geographic by a programming channels on the whole Federation
at the same time it facilitates the mobility of students in the pursuit of their
curriculum. One objective of this reform is to fight against the competition
sterile, strengthen collaborations and synergies between all
higher education institutions.
The PS will be particularly attentive to assist institutions
higher education, academic centers and research and Academy
Higher education (ARES) in achieving the various advanced
provided (enhanced mobility for students, organizing reform
the year of study, promotion of success, etc.).
Higher education has seen its numbers increase dramatically
over the past 20 years. The number of students rose from 117,000
students in 1991-1992 to 174,000 in 2011-2012, an increase of
50%. With the weak development of the closed envelope, the increase in
staffing resulted in a 10% decrease in the subsidy granted by
étudiant17. This reduction caused a decrease of the guidelines
Students with a consequent worsening of social inequalities.
For the PS, the growing success of higher education must lead
its real democratization, ensuring that everyone can benefit,
in the best conditions, this teaching.
A reform of higher education funding will allow
guarantee the quality of our teaching, ensuring democratic access and
fight against failure. The necessary reform must also resolutely
fit into the logic of cooperation and collaboration initiated by Decree
"Landscape".

1. R ESee FUNDING EDUCATION SUPERIE UR
If the distribution of funding can vary between institutions depending on
number of students they host, the overall funding of education

147

higher (universities, colleges, higher arts education) remains
Stable whatever the number of students.
The PS wants to thoroughly review the funding mechanisms at work
in our higher education. In this he is firmly in

estimate will be built across the whole higher education but
taking into account the specificities of each discipline and types
teaching, research activities or artistic practice or
Work required of teachers.
The distribution of resources must also take into account the distribution
current supply and the rate of access to higher education. According to
Observatory of Higher Education, "a joint on two of
Hainaut province is part of the 25% of municipalities where the rate of
Participation is lowest. "18
Recognizing the importance of unmet needs, the SP wants to

3. MPROVING AC TRANSFERABILITY OF EDUCATION SUPERIE UR
During this legislature, the registration fees were frozen amounts
2009. Scholarship students no longer pay school fees. For the students
of humble origins, these measures actually allow access to
Higher Education. With the PS, young precarious no longer pay
school fees. But there are still barriers and financial fees
remain different between higher education establishments and
sterile competition.
3.1.

STRENGTHENING THE ACCESS SCHOLARSHIP

Currently, all potential grantees do not use the law to them
offered by lack of information. In addition, scholarships are awarded on the basis
income parents two years before the year of studies, while the situation
Economic family can vary a lot faster.
To remedy these problems, the PS wants to:


keep free measures for the stock;



conclude a cooperation agreement with the Federal Public Service
Finance to automate, for people entering the
conditions the granting of a scholarship;



review the system of student grants and take into account situations



gradually raise the income limits to open at all
families who really need it.

In this context, the PS will be attentive to avoid stigmatization of students
receiving financial or educational assistance.
3.2.

DECREASE AND HARMONIZE THE COST OF STUDIES

For the PS, depending on available funding, it is necessary:


adapt, after evaluation of the current system, the amount of scholarships
costs for studies to enable all young people to access
higher studies ;



develop social support within each academic center
to promote success for the poorest students;



establish scholarships for all levels of study;

further promote social loans by better information for
students;



improve information for students about to free media
courses for scholarship students.

3.3.

MOBILIZE

ALL RESOURCES TO FIGHT THE BRAKES
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL

The number of students directed to social services and institutions
CPAS is increasing. Yet the psychological barriers or
Institutional still exist and prevent some students start
or pursue studies in higher education.
For the PS, you must:

encourage social service institutions to share in
the scale of a pole, their financial, human and technical
to best meet the needs of students;



coordinate social interventions for students, according
whether from a social service of an institution, or a CPAS
another organization, for the establishment of a "global social issue"
which in respect of social work ethics, will
accelerate and facilitate supported.

3.5.

CULTURAL BARRIERS FIGHTING

Our higher education is meant accessible to all. To play its role
social emancipatory, it must allow the greatest number to benefit from
quality training by offering a range of local. However, beyond the
physical and financial difficulties, it also persists cultural brakes
make some young people consider teaching as little or adapted to
their needs or acceptable to the family. For the PS, we must develop
concrete actions that can overcome these cultural barriers to access to
Higher Education.
Thus, the PS wants to:


offer targeted, relevant information to public and families on
opportunities dies and their academic requirements.

3.6.

FACILITATE ACCESS TO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES

Although disabled students are more likely to
enroll in higher education, they are still too much to have to give up
schooling beyond 18 years. Many are forced to orient their choice
not in terms of the training they wish to follow but according to
accessibility of educational sites. Are growing, higher education
less accessible to disabled students because of obstacles
151

and additional costs that could generate disability: Braille copies,
personal assistant, sign language translation, mobility ...
For the PS, the pursuit of higher education is nevertheless the best way to
successful social integration. It is important to provide access to education without
discrimination.
Under this term, an important step towards a more just society was
crossed by the adoption of the decree on inclusive higher education. This
Decree helps fill at least partially related inequalities

Besides the availability of infrastructure

establish a database of education students
Higher order to automatically grant allocations
Family for youth 18 and older who study without
this requires administrative approach of the family;



allow the splitting of family allowances between the two parents

So Wallonia has several years to prepare to host this
skill.
But for the PS must begin work now and:


to achieve economies of scale and be able to pursue a policy
Social coherent, prepare the reception of family allowances within
the public interest organization in charge of health and assistance to
persons;



implement automated processes so that citizens do
not face any administrative difficulties when moving;



ensuring the convergence of policies in Wallonia and
Brussels;



continue to involve family representatives and partners

A CCUEILLIR ALL E HILDREN

The needs of families with regard to childcare are changing
constant. The diversification of family models should be taken into
account, whether traditional families, single parent families,
stepfamilies, LGBT Family ... Similarly, casualization
growing following the economic crisis, combined with demographic boom
in some areas of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation (FWB) increased,
in recent years the inequalities in access to care services.
The reception of the child is a central issue for many parents. For the
PS, we must move towards a universal welcome. We must therefore provide solutions
practices for all children by providing hospitality services
sufficient, financially accessible and quality. Special attention
should be reserved for social diversity and the care of children from backgrounds
insecure.
The reception of children outside the family environment must meet two objectives:
contribute to the development of the child and its integration into the community
while promoting access for all to quality services.
Home child policy implemented by the Office of birth and
childhood (ONE) is a lever to deliver solutions that make life easier
women and men to reconcile private and professional life,
participate in socialization, autonomy and the development of their child.
2.1.

DEVELOP SMALL CHILDREN HOME

The increase in the home demand of small children outside the environment
Family is the generalization of the work of both parents and
the increasing number of single parent families.
Moreover, for every child attending a host environment is
important for their development and education. The reception of the small

should benefit from docking solution based on their needs.

167

2.1.1. STRENGTHENING THE OFFER QUALITY HOME FOR ALL CHILDREN
The priority is increasing the number of target spaces in areas where the
demographic pressure is greatest and in areas where the coverage rate
is lower than average.
For the PS, you must:


continue the effort begun with the Plan by establishing a Stork III
new programming to create a total 10,000 new
subsidized places for 2019, primarily in deficit areas;



identify deficit zones by establishing at each basin
of life, a register of availability crossed with related needs
demographic changes to objectify the selection of projects
of Home and financing of infrastructure operating costs;



incorporating criteria related to the socio-economic situation of inhabitants
a joint in the selection of priority projects.

There is still a significant difference in service offerings as
subregions. This is explained by the presence of a Home offers
Private whose price is not proportional to parental income. But
also by high inequality subsidized home offers. Thus, the
towns experiencing the highest population growth rate
are often poorer and therefore less able to finance the
construction of new childcare facilities and in the operation.
For the PS, the new subsidized childcare places must be
primarily created in these municipalities. The PS wants to ensure coverage
more equitable across the entire territory of the FWB. To do this, it is
need to develop programming criteria and system control
Home Equity and aimed to review the funding criteria for
introduce more solidarity in the distribution of the means of
operation between education authorities and host communities.
To meet this challenge, the PS proposes a partnership between the Regions and
of the FWB:


Children and infrastructure to ensure the viability of all
subsidized childcare facilities, among other mechanisms
effective solidarity to make an offer on the entire territory of
The FWB;







encourage the establishment of nurseries in zonings;



assess and, if necessary, extend the experience of creating crèches
in stations in large cities.
2.1.2. IMPROVING ACCESS MEDIA HOME

The host communities remain inaccessible for part of the population
despite a progressive financial participation of parents. The PS advocates
a fairer and more effective management of access to childcare places
available. Everyone is entitled to a quality welcome.
The PS wants in this regard:


promote a social mix by improving affordability
childcare facilities, introducing greater progressivity
Financial parental involvement for low and middle income;



study the possibility of a differentiated financing of host environments
depending on the audience attending the host environment;



adapt the financial participation system to make it more

extra for childcare and thus ensure the respect,
transparency and fairness of registration procedures;



educate families particularly precarious, with the interest in their
children, attend a group home setting.
169

2.1.3. DIVERSIFY THE OFFER HOME TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS
PARENTS AND CHILDREN

For many parents, a support five days a week, between
7:30 ET 17:30 is not satisfactory. For the PS, we must diversify supply
Home to the specific needs identified supra-level (see chapters Local Government and Territorial Development).
The PS wants to:


develop emergency reception and supply halts to allow Home
parents to quickly benefit from an appropriate greeting;



create close to home stops training centers
job seekers and mobile home teams for the regions
rural or semi-rural;



strengthen home outside normal hours (reception told
flexible) to stick better to the needs of parents subjected to
irregular hours;



foster home provides home for sick children;



encourage the creation of services "integrated", that is to say offering
Home diversity formulas to promote a social mix.
2.1.4. STRENGTHENING THE COORDINATION OF LEVEL OF AUTHORITY

Child hospitality policy is at the cross-competencies of the FWB,
Regions, the Federal State and local level. The creation of new spaces
Home requires the construction or renovation of infrastructure, support
aid policies in regional employment, compliance with accreditation standards and
means of operation of the FWB, logistical and financial support of
municipalities and provinces.
For the PS, the next Parliament is expected to strengthen the joint
the policies pursued by the various levels of government involved
in the home of our children and seek simplification and efficiency.
For this, the PS is attentive to:


coordination, notably through the adoption of common selection criteria,
programming new places of care facilities and
subsidies to employment;



establish a one-stop destination for developers
Home projects to better inform them on different devices
support for the creation of childcare places and to facilitate their efforts
administrative;



organize consultation and exchange of information between ONE and
other administrations concerned while simplifying procedures and
criteria for the creation of places;



confirm subsidized jobs for the reception and optimize this

end collaboration between FWB and Regions.
2.2.

STRENGTHENING THE HOME AFTER SCHOOL CHILDREN AND DURING HOLIDAYS

The host school and during school holidays for children aged two
and a half to twelve years must meet the new needs of families and
be accessible to all children, offering a secure framework, quality and
fulfilling for children.
2.2.1. Expand OFFER
The demand for home outside school hours is up
these last years. The growing population but also lengthening
commuting time / work, flexible schedules outside
school hours reinforce the application (see chapter Teaching required).
The PS proposes to:


ensure quality home offers financially accessible on
the whole territory of FWB;



ensure a free offer home until 18h in schools
basic education;



encourage, within primary schools, organizing activities
sports, cultural and artistic after 15:30;



expand the supply of homework schools that play a vital role in
social cohesion and school relationships - family;



develop a financially available Internship offers for all
Children two and a half to six years during school holidays;



take better account of the specific needs in rural areas linked to the
low population density;



foster child bearers management of disability in
of-school childcare facilities as an extension of logic



sustain jobs and structures currently financed by the Fund
equipment and utilities (CSCF) and are developing home

Regions, in consultation with the social partners;



regulate private and commercial initiatives taken proposing
in charge of the duties.
2.2.2. STRENGTHENING TIES WITH SCHOOL OF THE VITALITY
CHILD / STUDENT

Home request for children 2.5 to 12 years old must be thinking
close association with the school. Indeed, a significant portion of time spent
in the school walls is part of the school context (before 8:30 am and after

171

3:30 p.m.). For the PS, it is essential to consider the linkages between these times
proposing a framework that ensures respect for the child's needs.
The PS wants to:




improve synergies
teaching of the school;



harmonize and simplify the funding sources for initiatives

ENSURING QUALITY HOME

The professionalization of current childcare sectors should be the
supported by the government.
PS proposes to:


ensure the quality of life in host communities (meals, infrastructure,
sleep ...);



secure reception areas and their surroundings (zone 30, panels
intelligent, pedestrian crossing ...) and consider the needs of children and
families (using strollers ...) in urban development;



supporting continuing education for professionals and home integration
in host projects taking account of cultural diversity and

HEALTH
A child who has a fever, a relative who fight against disease,
knowledge that soon gives birth, a toothache suddenly a
TV report on food worries us ... Health is to
each of us, a daily concern.
According to the OECD, Belgium spends 10% of its GDP on health care. This is
less than in France, the Netherlands and Germany for each system
Yet commends the quality and accessibility!
For the PS, it is important to preserve our social model of health care
while reinforcing its strengths (including the essential role of mutual societies).

1. A G NSURING FINANCEME NT ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE
The Socialists have helped build our health insurance system
binding in the postwar period. The PS wants to show its commitment there: the
quality of care, ensuring care accessible to all and model
social dialogue are all reasons for our pride.
Faced with budgetary pressures, the PS will continue to defend the conquests
social and will fight to keep the solidarity principle deal with the disease in
basis of our health model.
It will continue to rigorously manage health care, but new
resources will be needed to fund technological developments, improve
reimbursement of care and coping with an aging population.
The legal standard of growth of health care budget is necessary
and is part of this goal.
The PS therefore proposes:


keep at least 3% of the legal standard of annual growth
health care budget for the 2014-2019 parliamentary term;



secure funding for services transferred to the federated entities
enable them to carry out all their tasks.

2. P BACK THAT PLUTO T G UERIR
2.1.

ENSURE EACH IS IN HIS LIFE FEEL GOOD

In 2012, the Socialist Mutuality / Solidaris conducted a study on the state of
psychological well-being of the Francophone Belgian population. It shows that only
a French-speaking Belgian in four feels no discomfort and a person
ten felt a deep discomfort permanently.

173

2.1.1. Pay special attention to adolescents
Adolescence is a particularly difficult period during which
Many young people feel bad about themselves.
PS proposes to:


determine in each school two contact persons "welfare" and provide contact details for all students so that
teenagers can discuss their problems with the person
which they have the greatest affinity and the manner of their choice
(orally, by e-mail, telephone ...)



encouraging the opening of "houses of the adolescent" that ensure
the interface between existing services so that young (or
their families) can address in one place all questions
concern (social relationships, parent-child conflict, sexuality,
etc.);



further reform the mental health sector by extending it to
children and adolescents in order to help young people in their
living environment.

Education relational life, emotional and sexual (abbreviated EVRAS) promotes,
Moreover, young people skills to make informed choices to flourish
in their social life, emotional and sexual and act in accordance with
self and others.
This is to accompany each youth to adulthood with an approach
Overall in which sexuality is understood in a broad sense and includes in particular
relational dimensions, emotional, social and cultural including the
philosophical dimension. The EVRAS developed throughout schooling in
respect for differences.
This process should be implemented gradually in all
schools of basic education, education
secondary, special education and teaching alternately
organized or subsidized by the Federation Wallonia-Brussels.
PS proposes to:


generalizing education for social life, emotional and sexual workplace
school;



strengthen "support points" EVRAS that support schools
the development of their project is empowering and facilitate partnerships with
associative actors (particularly with family planning centers
and associations of health promotion);



EVRAS widespread in all walks of life including by integrating
the prevention of HIV and other communicable diseases, the fight against
violence and homophobia, contraception, reproductive health,
romantic relationships, sexuality, etc.
174

2.1.2. Encourage well-being at work
The problems of unhappiness and stress at work are, too, growing. The
burnout has become a disease of civilization. The worker must
always be more productive, flexible, available ... This is of course before
everything on the organization of work that we must act to prevent this discomfort.
However, more targeted measures can prevent some
difficulties.
This is why the PS match:


train more intensively (future) managers and (future)
occupational physicians regarding well-being at work;



write a best practice guide for employers,
suggesting, for example, take the time to explain to the worker
how the computer equipment, machines ... it must
employ, to provide quiet areas where the worker can
"Shelter", etc. ;



ensure that the "technostress" or stress related to new
technologies (smartphones, tablets ...), is taken into account in the
risk analyzes that employers must make under
the rules on welfare at work;



giving every worker, at the signing of his contract,
document summarizing the law on well-being at work and showing
Physician contact information of the work;



increase the number of labor inspectors in order to tend to
standards recommended by the International Labour Organization (1
inspector per 10,000 workers against 1 for 26,000 workers
Belgium).

The inability to work should not be seen as inevitable and return
Voluntary towards quality employment should be the purpose of policies
in this sector. It should not amplify the casualization of insured
social. We must ensure they provide a decent quality of life.
The PS proposes to encourage social partners to consider:


more responsible employers to reinstate workers
victims of long-term incapacity for work by creating a system
bonus-malus on social security contributions to encourage employers to
conduct proactive policies for prevention and reintegration in
a budget-neutral framework;



evaluate and develop the "Back to Work" by mutual and devices
partners (Forem, Actiris, AWIPH, Inami ...), always on the basis
voluntary;



remove the alignment period of primary incapacity allowance
unemployment benefit, which is a "double punishment" for applicants
employment which are recognized unable to work;
175



to reflect on the transition between disability and unemployment.
2.1.3. Permit consultation of a professional if needed

More generally, it is important to allow everyone to be able to consult a
professional who can help him solve his problems.
The PS therefore proposes:


collect statistics on consultations among
psychotherapists to better understand the public concerned and
consultations to develop a repayment pilot project;



continue the development of mental health services in the
areas which do not.
2.1.4. Fight against addictions

Alcohol use is widespread in our society and is
inherent in our culture. The vast majority of citizens consumes alcohol
without risk or damage.
However, alcohol can be consumed risky and harmful way. The
consequences are so significant for the consumer, his entourage
but also for society.
This is why the proposed PS:


encourage discos, cafes, student evenings, festivals and other
party venues to adopt the label 'Quality nights', which provides in particular for
free access to water and raising awareness of the risks to staff
feast;



Increased disclosure standards for alcohol;



clarify the legislation regulating the sale of alcohol to minors
taking into account the alcohol content of drinks;



prohibit the sale of alcohol in vending machines and in the
service stations along the motorway;



indicate on labels
energy (calories);



better raise awareness as a whole to the extent and
nature of the health, social and economic problems caused by
the harmful use of alcohol;



strengthen prevention policy, especially with regard to groups
most affected targets;



train professionals to the accompaniment of
people with alcohol-related problems;



intensify controls of alcohol at the wheel to control each year

As for tobacco, we must continue to take measures on the one hand
encouraging each smoker to quit and also to discourage the
citizen to start. We must therefore continue our efforts to make this product
less attractive as possible.
This is why the PS wants to:


launching bold awareness campaigns on the risks of
tobacco and the tobacco industry practices;



associate professionals such as dentists or gynecologists in
"Walloon Plan without tobacco 'to develop and intensify;



continue to pay at the Walloon level, withdrawal consultations
smoking;



prohibit all direct or indirect tobacco advertising;



adopt a policy of deterrent prices.

The issue of cannabis has been debated in the news lately. A
working group of experts has already been set up and should
make its report late 2014.
For the PS, it must therefore be aware of this information and then:


develop within a "citizen panel", based on the findings of
group of experts already set up on the issue, the best compromise
to safeguard public health while not penalizing the most
consumer. It will also propose measures to
protect consumers traffickers channels.

Finally, the harder drug use is a real
public health problem. Dependent people and their families live
extremely difficult situations which require specific responses.
Numerous structures exist to help them but for the PS, it
must supplement the existing range of care so that every patient can find
appropriate responses to their situation. The transfer of the policy against
addictions to the federated entities is an opportunity to build a
more coherent policy.
PS proposes to:


strongly develop prevention, against young people in particular,
including educating all students during their addictions
education, developing a particular methodology with stakeholders
Health ;



opened in some large cities, where the problems are most
important of safer consumption rooms to allow
for dependents, for which cessation therapies
have not yet been possible to achieve, not to inject their products

social workers and medical staff;


support the creation of housing for welcoming people
dependent emerging from treatment, so they are accompanied in
reintegration;



assess where and at what cost it may be appropriate to develop
Wallonia and Brussels diacetylmorphine treatment to
Long Term heroin, refractory to all other
treatments.
2.1.5. Ensuring safe food supply and encourage
healthy

Access for all to safe food and high nutritional value is a right
fundamental. For the PS, should be continued in the federated entities, the shares
launched in 2005 as part of the National Nutrition and Health Plan which aims
to change the eating habits of the population, with special attention
children.
An investigation by the Socialist Mutuality / Solidaris nevertheless confirms that
must go further: 63% of Belgians believe that most products
food have a "significant" risk or "very important" for
their health. 57% indicate not understand the instructions on the
product labels.
The PS wants to:


authorize or not food additives (preservatives, sweeteners,
dyes, flavor enhancers, emulsifiers ...) exclusively based
Independent scientific reports and in no case on the basis
of studies funded by industry as is
today ;



revalue faster food additives permitted in Europe
to take account of new scientific knowledge;



prohibit, at European level, food additives used for
no marketing of functional utility (such as certain dyes
food that may mislead the consumer into error);



have it checked by a public body present on the allegations
food packaging and advertising, such as "decreases
cholesterol "or" high fiber ";



strengthen controls to prevent new scandals like
of horse meat;



greater use of pictograms, more recognizable as text, for
indicate allergens on labels;



ensure the supply of healthy, tasty and sustainable food at all
collective structures for youth 0-18 years through the use of
special specifications prepared by high dietary schools;
178



free distribution to school, a seasonal fruit and production
Local daily to each student so that all children receive
healthy snack.
2.2.

ORGANIZE BETTER HEALTH PROMOTION

Acting health promotion is to take into account all
influence health: the environment, living conditions, the
income, employment, etc. The promotion of health is therefore outside
health sector but also in the sectors of employment,
housing, education, etc.

elements
relationships,
only the
mobility,

By acting on these determinants, health promotion contributes to the quality
life, welfare and health under the definition of the Organization
World Health (WHO).
To improve the different actions, the PS proposes to:


organizing "networks" of health promotion to gather
information on the initiatives taken locally and ensure more
coherence and better coverage of the territory;



allow health promotion operators to organize their activities
on a longer term concluding with them program contracts
assorted multi-year funding;



support the development of local partnerships between local centers
promotion of health and primary care services (service
mental health, medical homes, home care, planning centers
family, associations of general practitioners, the NEB services
promotion of health services at school, etc.);



bring the health promotion of those devices cohesion
social.

Health is a vital need to preserve and promote from birth. A
universal health care system must be accessible to all children without any
distinction to the end of their schooling.
The ONE and health promotion services in schools are services
universal.
To allow different audiences to access without discrimination, must be
develop complementary strategies, diversified and proximity:


combine individual offer offered by ONE (monitoring, consultations ...) with
Assignments collective health promotion, for example by
the organization of group facilitation sessions;



encourage partnerships between ONE and promotion agencies



actively promote self-esteem of each child by showing him

frequent;


conduct campaigns of general interest to promote health soon



strengthen the participation of target populations for program

2.3.

PREVENT THE SPREAD OF DISEASE THROUGH VACCINATION

Vaccination protects the citizen against the disease and its
possible complications and protect others by not spreading the disease
the family environment, friendly, professional, people rubbed shoulders in
transport as well as vulnerable people (the sick, women
pregnant too young to be vaccinated infants, immunocompromised individuals,
elders…).
The PS therefore proposes:


maintain and intensify vaccination campaigns based on
immunization schedule;



increase the immunization coverage rate to reach the critical threshold
beyond which the epidemic potential disappears;



to change the immunization schedule based on the recommendations of the
Superior Health Council;



continue to guarantee the opportunity to be vaccinated in both
providers
Individual
(pediatricians,
doctors
GPs,
Gynaecologists ...) than in the NEB structures following the transfer of the
full competence in the vaccination WallonieBruxelles Federation;



Gynecologists of any developments in immunization;



organize a structural partnership with the circles of doctors,
Local groups Medical Evaluation (Glem), groups of
pediatricians, gynecologists groups, the planning centers
family ... to raise awareness of the importance of vaccination;



ensure an exchange of data and regular collaboration

and

REDUCING HEALTH SOCIAL INEQUALITY

Disadvantaged people are more confronted with the disease
others. To be healthy, a person must be able to rely on
basic resources: housing, access to education, to eat properly,
have some income, etc.

180

The struggle against social inequalities in health is a major concern
for PS. It requires establishing partnerships and transversal
calls for the participation of all stakeholders.
The PS therefore proposes:


better train professionals to reducing social inequalities
health by developing a repository defining training needs
by occupational categories;



establish a charter to actively involve other sectors
(including education, housing, employment ...) in development
useful interventions to reduce health inequalities;



ensure increased participation of citizens and local actors
social sector, education, etc. in universal services and
health promotion programs;



integrate explicitly and structurally issues of inequality
Social in all health systems;



partnerships between the struggle against poverty and networks
operators of health promotion.

2.5.

Upgrade the FIRST LINE CARE

In prevention, the first line of care obviously has a role
essential to play. The role of the general practitioner is central and should be welcomed and
reinforced in the future.
PS proposes to:


promote the use of comprehensive medical record among both
GPs and patients to strengthen the role of
GP as a privileged interlocutor of the patient;



evaluate the system of prevention of global medical record module, the
"DMG +";



support group practice initiatives (in medical homes or
medical centers), enabling to offer a multidisciplinary framework
and increase the visibility of the first line.

3. I NFORMER PATIENT AND ALLOW TO EVERYONE
CARE

3.1.

INFORM THE PATIENT THE COST OF HEALTH CARE

It is not always easy to obtain information on the cost of a
visit to the doctor or hospital treatment. When the patient
receives the invoice and realizes that her application provider supplements
high, it is too late to consult another doctor.

181

To improve patient information, the PS proposes to:


create a website that allows each patient to know the price
a visit to the doctor he wants to consult;



improving information at the first consultation by obtaining
a patient's written consent to the treatment by a
non-contracted provider;



allow patients to get a quote before hospitalization
private room (surcharges have been banned on the initiative of
PS, in a shared room and two beds);



ensure that all care providers (contracted or not)
give, and must in any event, each patient
clear and detailed invoice mentioning at his own expense (including
the fee supplements) and community office;



strengthen the role of mutual societies as an actor prevention through
complete information on patient load fees.

3.2.

Revalue THE SOCIAL PRACTICE MEDICINE

To improve access to care for precarious people and strengthen
fundamental role of the first line of care, the PS proposes to:


encourage the creation of social medical homes by strengthening their
financing;



educate doctors in training in the practice of medicine
social proximity through internships in medical homes, centers
PMS or within the CPAS.

3.3.

AVOID THE REPORT CARE

The Public Health Institute already fell in 2008: nearly 14% of the
people postpone care for financial reasons. This fact worsens
even in precarious categories of the population and for patients
chronically ill.
In order to curb this phenomenon, the PS wants to:


automatically identify, in collaboration with the administration of
Finance (SPF Finances), persons likely to benefit from
increased intervention, that is to say a better reimbursement
health care ;



Social automate third-party payment through electronic billing
the precarious patients (recipients of increased response or
chronically ill status);



better pay dental and eyeglass lenses for these
same categories of patients.

182

3.4.

TAKE ACTION IN SPECIFIC DENTAL CARE

The PS wants to act from an early age to encourage each child
good habits in dental hygiene. But with
the lengthening of life, the issue of accessibility of dental care becomes
also more crucial than ever.
That's why the SP wants to take specific action
dental material and in particular:


develop preventive dental material in schools;



better information to families regarding free dental care
among dentists contracted for under 18;



mainstream dentists in medical centers (in
more doctors, nurses and physiotherapists (s) which are already practicing
currently) to enhance access for people with precarious
dental care ;



best reimburse preventive dental care and prostheses
Dental for people in need.

3.5.

REDUCE PRICES AND FACILITATE THE REIMBURSEMENT OF MEDICINES

Since 2006, the price of drugs to the patient decreased by 16%. For
to reallocate resources to reimbursement of new treatments it
is necessary to further reduce costs by continuing to favor
cheaper drugs (originals and generics and off-patent
biosimilaires19).
The institutions (hospitals and nursing homes) are still using too little
drugs cheaper: it is therefore mainly Herein lies the challenge for the future.
At the hospital, the PS proposes to:


pay a flat rate to all oncology drugs
encourage the use of cheaper drugs and so the
discounts negotiated by hospitals benefit health insurance, while
allowing growth of this class of drugs;



empower the hospital if it does not reach a usage quota of
new generics and biosimilars.

In the area of ​​nursing homes, the PS proposes to:


19

allow nursing homes to better negotiate prices
drugs allowing the pharmacist to supply, for all
Patients who have the same treatment, a generic of the same brand,
unless the doctor otherwise motivated prescriber;

Drugs produced by biotechnology whose patent has expired

183



reduce the number of drugs prescribed and improve choice
treatments by organizing "patient medication reviews" between
actors (prescriber, pharmacist and, if applicable,
coordinating physician and advisor to the nursing home) on the basis of a
pharmaceutical form containing the drug with the best
price / quality ratio.

In the outpatient sector, the PS proposes to:


automatically increase the percentage of cheaper drugs
that physicians should prescribe on the arrival of new
generic drugs;



require doctors to prescribe the active ingredient of the drug (and
not brand) for acute treatment and during the initiation of a
chronic treatment, so the pharmacist dispenses the patient
The cheapest drug.

The PS also wants to give special attention to the repayment
and innovative treatments against rare diseases:


negotiate at the European level of the tariff for drugs
rare diseases in order to obtain better prices for all;



allow early repayment of the Innovative Medicines
reducing time procedures.

More generally, the PS wants to move towards standardization at the level
European drug prices, including through the exchange of information
between States.

REDUCE HOSPITAL BILL

In the previous legislature, with the PS, the fees of supplements
common rooms with two beds have been removed. Since 2009, the cost
means a stay in twin bedroom has decreased by 30%.
Hospital care, all specialties, must be accessible
all. It is unacceptable that a small minority of doctors select their
clients in targeted geographical areas, accept to administer
care that particular room or abandon any hospital activity
in order to practice disproportionate rates.
Specifically, the PS proposes to:


prohibit fee supplements

Under the leadership of the PS, chronic disease management was a
priority of government action in health in the last five
years. Strong measures were taken as recognition of status
the person with a chronic condition or complete reform
management of pain in hospitals.
The PS proposes to continue these efforts and:


create, for chronic patients their agreement, folder
multidisciplinary medical electronics which all providers

in case of difficulty to diagnose and to prevent the return of
doctor to doctor, quickly organize a
consultation
multidisciplinary gathering various specialists to reduce the
time of diagnosis, improve the quality and ensure taking
load and adequate treatment.

4.3.

PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES TO HOSPITAL CLASSIC

When possible, it is preferable to shorten or avoid stays
the hospital to promote the well-being of the patient and reduce the cost of treatment
while maintaining quality of care.
The day hospitalization is becoming more common and length of stays
the hospital is greatly reduced. We must continue this trend, ensuring
however, that it does not harm the vulnerable populations.
Furthermore, we must ensure, at home, the care required by the patient in
safely and at lower costs than institutional care, through
an efficient organization.
The home hospital provides patients whose condition requires care
complex, within several health professions, but do require
over the continued presence of these professionals nor the heavy infrastructure
technology available in the hospital.
This comprehensive support required in some cases the use of services
home help.
PS proposes to:


develop pilot projects to determine an alternative
(at home or in a rehabilitation center) adequate, accessible and
quality to conventional hospitalization cases where the condition of the
patient no longer justifies an intense medicalized environment
specialized;



anticipate doing so adequate funding for the management of
patients who, because of their socio-economic status and / or
the lack of suitable infrastructure home, an extended stay

SENIORS
For the first time in our history, five generations coexist and
meet. The presence of seniors in our society is an asset
for everyone. It is important to give them more attention for their
afford to live in good health and as long autonomously
possible. This is a major concern for seniors and their relatives.
For the PS, this is in the context of a global and coordinated approach between
various actors involved, to act not only for their income,
security, independence and their health care, but also to enable
Elders participate fully in the social, economic, political and
associative within their means, needs and aspirations.
The authorities must continue their efforts to preserve the autonomy

intergenerational solidarity and strengthening social cohesion.
The regionalization of expertise in this area offers the opportunity of a
greater consistency and enable the development of an integrated policy that places
the elder at the center in order to offer the best service at
best price.

O ffering A CADR E VI E OF THE OLDER THE AGREAB

Retirement does not match inactivity. Seniors are present in all
sectors of social life. It is therefore essential when promoting and maximizing the
to encourage active participation and intergenerational solidarity.
It is important to continue to make public space safer and more user-friendly
for seniors. Mobility is also a necessary condition for
active participation of all in society and the fight against all forms
isolation.
Participation requires access to information in order to stay connected to life
society and benefit from his rights: culture, housing, assistance, care,
pensions, etc. This access can be facilitated by the creation of contact points
proximity.
In this context, the PS proposes to:


offer a pleasant and clean environment, green spaces,
places to rest (benches), welcoming sidewalks for
seniors, safe pedestrian crossings, public buildings
accessible, private and public services responsive to seniors;



promote the establishment and maintenance of small shops
in neighborhoods and villages;



This transfer of authority will be the opportunity to improve the consistency between
home help and residential care policies. It nevertheless represents a
major challenge since it will ensure that everyone receives his allowance
timely and that the institutions are properly funded.
For the PS, it is essential to:


A person aged 65 and over in five is exposed to the risk of pauvreté20,
against one in seven people in the under 65 years.
A consistent policy, pension costs will increase by 0.8% of the product
GDP by 2018 and 4.5% of GDP by 206021.
We can obviously we divert needs of pensioners
current and future pretext that the means shall fail.
For the PS, we must develop our pension system to make it more
fair. There needs to be a minimum level of pension common to all
pension plans so that every pensioner is entitled to a decent pension,
whatever may have been his career. It is also necessary to make the
more transparent and better inform citizens when entering the
labor market to increase confidence in our legal system pension.

E NSURING FINANCEME NT THE PENSION

In the coming years, the share of seniors in the population will
stop increasing: today, 15-64 years constitute 66%
population against 18% for 65 and over, whereas in 2060 they
representing respectively 58 and 26% of the population.
A consistent policy, a relatively small number of workers will
therefore finance the pensions of a greater number of retirees.
For the PS, it is necessary to ensure the funding of a decent pension
for all current and future seniors. This is also why the PS
claims that we make structural security for the balance staffing
social.
Moreover, it would be indecent to ask the fifties and that soixantenaires

We always can not ask for more efforts to youth
generations to finance the pensions of their parents and grandparents. The
young people face the economic crisis, with real estate prices more
and higher, mortgage credit less accessible to
child care expenses ... We must give them to them, too, an adequate income
and, later, a decent pension.
To reconcile these legitimate interests, it is imperative to concentrate efforts
on job creation (see Chapter employment): if we create jobs, we

Social to pay pensions.
It should also draw upon those with the broadest shoulders. For the
PS, this is not a caricature to say that we must tax the rentiers rather than
ask the cashiers or masons to work longer: it is a
simple matter of social justice (see Chapter taxation).
Finally, we must continue to foster increased effective retirement age to
retirement. To do this, the PS proposes to give a tax credit representing a
net gain of at least 120 euros per month to all who have the right to leave
early retirement given the legislation but choose
continue working (provided that their net income is less than 3000 euros
per month).

M AKING PENSION SYSTEM OVER THE EQUITAB

Our insurance-pension system, that is to say that everyone pays
contributions and pensionable salary that depends on the number and
years of labor worked. But our pension system is also supportive,
so as to ensure a decent pension for people who have had a small
income and / or experienced personal accident (illness, unemployment, loss of a
spouse, etc.).
For the PS, it is important to maintain both. However, in a
period in which it is difficult to unlock new ways for the
pensions (simply because the current system is already
a high cost), it is preferable to assign the priority means
available for the benefit of small and average pensions.
The PS therefore proposes:

22



MPROVING THE PURCHASING POWER OF PENSIONERS

The situation of a number of pensioners is worrying. Certainly,
the level of the state pension is not enough to express the real standard of living of
Pensioners: depending on whether one is owner or not, depending on whether one has a
supplemental pension or not, etc., a pension of 1,200 euros / month may have
a meaning quite different.
This is not only on pensions that action is needed to
improve the living conditions of pensioners. The pension is often not enough
to pay the bill of a nursing home, for example, but for the PS is
directly on the cost of nursing homes and on improving services
home help that action is needed to meet this goal, not on the level
of the pension, which is sometimes touch for 30 years while we have spent 3
years in nursing home.
Nevertheless: it is essential to ensure that every pensioner receives
means that allow it to live in dignity, to leisure, to please
his grandchildren.
For this purpose, the proposed PS:

5.



bring to the minimum pension for a single person to at least 1300
euros / month (for a full career) by the end of next
legislature, regardless of the regime (salaried, independent, official,
mixed career);



bring to 1,150 euros / month income guarantee for the elderly
(Grapa), enjoyed by people who are not entitled to a pension
sufficient, for example because they have not worked enough
years and who have no other financial resources;



preserve the automatic increase pension under the
link to well-being (in addition to indexing);



adjust the rules for calculating the withholding tax to
translate, better than today, gross increases in pension
net increases;



continue the process of individualisation of rights without undermining the
established situations.

The uptrend in sales of goods online is one of the
Key trends in purchasing behavior in recent years.

221

Belgium is on track to meet the objectives of the Digital Agenda
European since 45% of Belgians have made purchases online in 2012
(the target is 50% by 201525).
If we welcome this diversification of supply, it is essential to strengthen
information and consumer protection to avoid scams and
other abuses. The online sale has indeed a series of risks that PS
strictly regulate wishes to foster the growth of online commerce
optimum safety.
Thus, for example, too often consumers purchasing a property in a

framing the issue of domain names .be puts at risk the
protection of consumers and SMEs face lightly armed sellers

That is why the proposed PS:
 strengthen control and watch over the Internet and respect for

MPROVING ENCE OF THE T RANSPAR nancial FI PRODUCTS

In recent years, public confidence has been severely weakened after
the actions of some international financial institutions but also
Belgian. This is why major reforms were launched to better
control the financial products offered to consumers, mainly by
a strengthening of the Authority's supervisory tasks and services markets
Financial (FSMA).
The PS considers it necessary, however, remain aware that reforms
now produce their effects and wishes of further progress for the
consumer.
PS proposes to:


require for a particularly complex financial product can
get his European passport and be distributed throughout
the European Union, that a certain proportion (percentage) in
is sold in the country in which he obtained his passport;



implement an ambitious labeling program
understandable financial products and implement a monitoring of it;



prohibit the purchase, subscription, sale, supply, dissemination or
promotion of financial instruments whose obvious purpose is to
to depend on the performance of the investment on speculation



strengthen controls to ensure compliance with and implementation
effective of the directive on markets in financial instruments
(MIFID) to improve the transparency and readability of products



require banks and insurance companies to guarantee the level of
adequate training for their employees, allowing them
to inform the consumer correctly;



extend the advertising rules applicable to savings accounts



merge the base rate and the fidelity bonus in a single rate,
facilitating the comparability of interest rates offered on

MPROVING and pest ON IN RESPECT OF INSURANCE

Ensure it is simply to protect against what might happen. In
Indeed, no one is immune from an accident that can result in damage
tangible and material. Insurance is primarily based on the principles
human solidarity and sharing, thus allowing to protect
the biggest number.
But insurance companies have too often

Today, it is unacceptable that some people can

important simply because one is young or senior; they live or Liege
Virton, or that we have had a health problem. For the PS, only the
actual individual behavior of the insured and the criteria on which it can
actually act should be included in the insurance premium.
PS proposes to:


reintroduce the bonus-malus system for civil liability
(RC) car to fight, especially against excessive bonuses
claimed to young drivers and seniors;



make more transparent the criteria for defining the
amount of insurance premiums in particular by prohibiting totally

AND

DEMOCRAT ISER

10.1. REDUCE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE
In recent years allowed to show substantial progress in
reducing the digital divide by providing an increasing number of
citizens access to the Internet. We are well past 34% of Belgians
having never used the internet in 2006 to 15% in 2012.
Although the goals of the European Digital Agenda are attained in the
terms, Belgium still lags behind in some neighboring countries and should
aim for much more ambitious goals. Reducing the cost of access to
Internet, still too high despite efforts must be continued.
The biggest challenge today is to fight against fracture
Digital strikes Internet use (digital divide second
level), ie the ability of citizens to use the internet optimally
according to its needs. In recent years, the fracture has indeed changed
Access to use so that the current challenge is to ensure that the
Users of the digital potential draw a social benefit and
especially adults.
In line with the objectives set at the European Union, Belgium must
have the ambition to gradually reduce the digital divide
offering, a few years here, easy and democratic internet access at all.
For the PS, it is fundamental that the most insecure citizens are not
private access to the multimedia world and do not face discrimination
based on their income.
In this perspective, the PS proposes to:


adopt a new national plan against the digital divide following
the evaluation of the first plan;



reinforce the learning of new technologies in adults;



index the reduced maximum amount for rates of beneficiaries
Social and ease of automation, like what is done for
energy;



take steps to involve telecom operators in the fight
to reduce the digital divide, including strengthening
the availability, at an affordable price, an Internet connection

public libraries;



continue the development of digital public spaces (EPN) for



promote digital technologies and services easier to use

10.2. ENSURING QUALITY AND SAFETY TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS
In the coming years, we must pay the utmost attention to
development of a high performance and efficient broadband network (100 Mb / s) ..
The level of high-speed broadband connection must become a reality across
the territory. Belgium must also meet the objectives of the strategy
European declined in the "Digital Agenda" 27. This is especially an issue
competitiveness for our companies as an opportunity enabling the
Tomorrow population have very high speed. On the other hand, despite the
Legal enhancements, enabling customers to more easily change

consumer protection.
Finally, the proliferation of malicious attacks via the Internet has demonstrated the
need to quickly put in place an action plan in which the
Operators will have a key role to play to protect the best
consumer.
Therefore, the proposed PS:


promote the development of very high speed on the whole territory
by the adoption of a national broadband rollout plan
coordinated between the federal state and the regions, like our neighbors
European;



continue the fight to democratize the cost of internet access in
European level;



require operators to participate in network security and development
establishment of a national cyber security policy;



oblige operators to ensure the protection of data
staff of their clients;

27

Remember, the objectives of the European Digital Agenda 2020 are:
- 100% of households have access to an internet connection of more than 30 Mbps
- 50% of the subscribers must have more than 100 Mbps connection

228



stimulate providers to increase the capacity and quality
their offers, especially the triple play;



require operators to provide information about the speed



oblige operators to indicate the volume explicitly
data exchanged on the invoice;



increase transparency on tariff rates and invoices,
including standardizing invoice templates;



facilitate comparison of prices by reducing the number of packages

10.3. ENSURING THE NET NEUTRALITY

Today, the technological possibilities (Internet, smartphones, ...) to
communicate, exchange, innovation and access to cultural works are
ever more numerous. These multiple access possibilities undergo yet
direct or indirect attacks of operators or production companies
technological devices to restrict this access. To counter these
attacks, the development of quality Internet, net neutrality
and terminals are three crucial issues.
The net neutrality guarantees such a simple little blog or website
Local information is also easily accessible than a big streaming site.
But today, in many countries, the net neutrality is reset
involved: the internet service providers in favor websites
according to their own commercial interests that might create an internet
"Two-speed" at the expense of the free choice of users, freedom
expression, innovation and cultural diversity.
On the other hand, the neutrality must be guaranteed in terms of media
so that every citizen can have access to all the offers available on the internet
including public audiovisual services, without selection or orientation
prior operators or apparatus products to a specific content
making it easier access thereto. This is called neutrality
terminals.
The PS proposes to:


adopt a law on net neutrality in the context of the future
European directive to ensure that neutrality (Speed
download, allocated bandwidth, information transparency
consumers, ...);



ensure neutrality of terminals, including:
o

forcing producers at European level terminals
(smartphones, tablets, etc.) not only put on the market
terminals providing access to any Internet without restriction.

ACCOMMODATION
Housing is one of the main concerns of the population. Often
too expensive and / or dilapidated, housing is playing an increasingly important
in household budgets. Unregulated market, failure of an offer to
quality both private and public, non-adapted housing aging
population and changing family patterns, price increase
rents, difficulties to access the property, unhealthy, energy charges
important are factors that make access difficult housing.
Yet without accessible housing and good quality, it can not be a
welfare and social emancipation.
Therefore, for the PS, it is essential to conduct a housing policy
coherent and voluntary.



systematically use the building charges for integrating the
public housing across the private real estate project (renovation or





rehabilitating buildings classified by their transformation, where
technically possible, public or mixed housing.

If the optimal use of land and property resources is
a prerequisite for the massive construction of public housing, it
also necessary to accelerate the implementation of projects. In this regard, the system
Law communal drawing on regional subsidies, experimented with
successfully for subsidies for road works and public buildings,
must be transposed to the housing sector. The drawing right, through a

distribution of subsidies among municipalities based on objective criteria and
known in advance, allowing each municipality to know over
multiyear the exact amount of the shell to which it is entitled.
The advantage of the investment fund on the current distribution system
budget "accommodation" is that it includes an important simplification pane
Administrative, based on the principle of trust, which accelerates the
implementation of projects: an investment program approved by the
government, a lighter supervision, a single administrative contact for
operators greater autonomy, liquidation of regular envelopes
independent of the rate of completion of work, a subsequent check of
thereof.
PS proposes to:


use the system of "drawing rights" including in the fund
communal regional investment subsidies for
231

Housing and distribute the "Housing" section of this fund based on
objective criteria related to the needs of the population and the rental offer
local public.
To increase the supply of available rental housing, public authorities
may also act on private assets underutilized or poorly-used. For the
PS, it is appropriate to strengthen the tools available, including the management decision
adding frames rent and housing quality leased to
fight more effectively against the vacancy of the frame or its degradation.
PS proposes to:


strengthen management decision - by the Social Estate Agencies (AIS)
and public service housing companies (SLSP) - Housing
deprived by the government, forcing each municipality to
join an ISA, by ensuring adequate funding (especially
to compensate for losses due to transfer of jurisdiction
provincial to the region) and conducting awareness campaigns on
the benefits of management taken from the owners, with
special attention on rural areas characterized by low
number of available rental properties;



develop a strategy involving the Commons to put on
Rental Market unoccupied dwellings, by operating the principle of
"Soft requisition", namely the well through the management decision
work through bonuses and loans at favorable rates,
provided that if the owner of an unoccupied dwelling is not responding
or denies the management decision or rental of his property on the market
private, it will be automatically applied it to a municipal tax whose rate
minimum will be set by the Region;



support joint if needed supra-organized way in
development of a public real estate agency, responsible for operations
redemption and renovation of substandard housing, unoccupied or
uninhabitable for resale or rental of their implementation;



promote the development of housing on the upper floors of
trade and processing of empty offices into housing, by
establishment of adequate taxation and an accompanying
owners (Information management decision and leases, assistance
Installation of planning dossiers to create entries
Private, bonuses, etc.);



encourage owners to value their undeveloped land, located within
central areas in rural and urban areas, to avoid retention
land and to fight against real estate speculation by providing
dissuasive taxation of owners of these lands
(rights holders for 8 years and older, unless the vacancy is due to
a case of force majeure and from a floor area).

Finally, the creation of housing and also happen necessarily by
massive private sector investment. It is therefore necessary to support the sector
construction which employs nearly 300,000 people in Belgium, not jobs
relocatable.
232

To support the industry and encourage them to build more housing,
especially in the central areas of cities and villages to avoid
dispersed settlement, the PS offers include:


further simplification of administrative procedures and
accelerating the processing of cases for the construction or
housing renovation;



extend to all areas of rehabilitation and urban revitalization and
as rural development schemes, the reduction of VAT from 21
6% on demolition operations / reconstruction of buildings
abandoned, whatever the type of operator;



create within the regional administration an "partnerships Service
public-private "to accompany the technical implementation and
financial public-private housing development projects, creating
conditions of mutual trust between the partners and thereby facilitating
the realization of projects.

2. R EGULER THE PRIVATE RENTAL March C HE
If the construction of new housing, both public and private, can alleviate
real estate pressure, it is not enough to restore a balance between supply and
demand in the private rental market. Households, as precarious as those
from the middle class, will experience more and more difficulties to face
the cost of rent and the security deposit to form. To do this, it is
necessary to establish a genuine regulation of the sector today
abandoned "all market", and strengthen the rights and duties of both
owners and tenants.
The PS proposes to:


frame the rents by the establishment of a system of "bonusmalus" tax of weighting the real estate tax property
leased depending on the compliance of the rent compared to a
Indicative grid rents established based on the type of property, its
sanitary equipment, its energy performance, situation,
etc ... to reward owners respectful of wellness
their tenants and strengthen responsible ownership bit
scrupulous;



give the magistrate's jurisdiction to review, at the request of
tenant or prospective tenant a rent that exceeds
unreasonably and unjustifiably these reference rents;



statutorily limiting rent increases of two contracts
lease concluded with different tenants (excluding consideration of
Any improvements made good);



fix the security deposit two months for all tenants;



create a regional fund universal rental guarantee, powered by
233

all the guarantees from banks presently constituted,
which would guarantee to the owner, if the conditions are
met and in case of early termination of the lease, the payment of the
comprehensive warranty even if it is not yet fully formed
by the tenant (the warranty can be made gradually
with the funds).
If the rent must be reasonable, it is also appropriate to ensure that
landlords paying their rent.
PS proposes to:


explore the possibility for Wallonia to set up insurance
loss of income for the tenant, like the loss of insurance
Revenue for Contracting a mortgage, to ensure
payment of rent for up to 6 months despite the loss of income
Provisional tenant;



establish an alert mechanism for the owner, from the
Non-payment of two months' rent, seize the Joint Committee
tenant-owners of a Conciliation Commission, where appropriate in
relationship with the debt mediation services.

Nevertheless, the regulation of private rents will be implemented only if
Governments have complete and accurate information on the state of
housing market.
The PS proposes to:


establish a register of real rents, through the intersection
data from the rental license and the Regional Guarantee Fund
rental, provided that the obligation of communication to the candidate
Tenant energy certificate will be extended to the rent previously
perceived and, at its domicile in the town, the tenant
communicate the amount of the rent.

Certain legal obligations establishing a balanced relationship between owners
and tenants exist but are poorly enforced. It should strengthen
existing rules and enforce them in order to protect both tenants
the owners.
PS proposes to:


extend the obligation to hire opportunity for all leased assets and forecast
it will be valid for 5 years for goods under 28 sqm and10 years
all other goods;



included in the rental license certificate PEB, which will
to inform the tenant of compliance with minimum health and
security ;



mandatory use of a lease-type, in order to make the relationship
contract between the lessor and the lessee more predictable;
234



improve information for owners and tenants about their
rights and duties, through communal services of housing,
time of registration of the lease, etc. ;

Finally, some owners, fortunately rare, are taking advantage of the precariousness of
part of the population and non regulation of the rental market for rent
substandard goods and often at exorbitant prices. For the PS, the fight
against the slum landlords must be a priority for all
authorities (municipalities, regions, police, fire service, CPAS, etc.).
PS proposes to:


strengthen the fight against slum landlords at local level
by the implementation of a systematic action against owners
focusing both on the information that prevention and sanctions, which
requires better coordination of relevant services (police,
firefighters, CPAS, urban planning, population, etc.);



ensure, through the planning permission, to avoid the division of buildings
too small cells;



allow eminent domain buildings
unhealthy and uninhabited.

3. P ERMETTRE A FAIR IN THESE AC RENTAL HOUSING PUBLIC
AND IMPROVING THE "LIVING - TOGETHER"
The lack of public housing and the criteria for allocation of these limited
currently the possibility for a portion of the population, including
workers with low incomes, access to public rental housing. In
parallel, the past ten years, some public housing neighborhoods
becoming real ghettos where social problems accumulate and
strengthen, degrading the quality of life in cities. For the PS, the social mix
in public housing through housing construction more
diversified and adapted to changes in society (aging
population, blended families, etc.), better integrated in their
environment and better distributed throughout the Walloon territory.
In this respect, for the PS, it is important to achieve the minimum 10% objective
public housing by municipality. However, this offer must be adapted
the needs of the local population and must take account of the situation
special property of the municipality (high real estate pressure zones,
rural, aging or rejuvenation of the student population,
rental demand or rather acquisitive, etc.), whilst ensuring a minimum of
rental housing to households with insecure income, to avoid

FROM

The Walloon public housing sector is today at a crossroads.
After a decade of reforms that have resulted in underfunding

find a financial balance, otherwise not be able to assume the
necessary investments in both new construction and renovation

tenants, taking greater account of the economic value of the property
rented while maintaining its social character.

239

In order to improve the sector's financial situation, the proposed PS:


establish a new calculation of public housing rents, which is
transparent, balanced and fair, starting from the economic rent and
subtracting the social characteristics of the tenant household;



reinforce the perception of unpaid rent in all SLSP, by
proactive approach to the defaulting tenants and a quick call

MOBILITY
Mobility is a key issue for the PS. It allows everyone to access
work or school, to practice their leisure or just to make his
races. Extensive use of the car and the truck and the impact this
generates in terms of congestion and pollution are, however,
significantly affect our mobility and our living environment. The objective of
PS is therefore to promote mobility which contributes to social progress and
economic development of our society while respecting our more
environment.
The first challenge is to ensure safe and accessible to all guests. The PS does
not want a two-tier society where some citizens have the opportunity to
move easily while others have never crossed the borders of
their country, their city or even their neighborhood. It's a financial issue but
also access to information that must be resolved to make public transport
accessible. This discrimination also affects people with disabilities.
The second challenge is economic. Belgium and Wallonia have since
long focused on the transport and logistics as sources of
development and employment. To continue their growth, these sectors should
become more sustainable. The dependence on oil is also a decrease
issue to be considered.
The third issue relates to our quality of life. Road traffic is the
first source of insecurity and produces stress, pollution
air and noise that are harmful to health. Fossil fuels
emit more greenhouse gases that contribute to global
planet.
Faced with these challenges, the PS designs mobility in terms of accessibility. This is,
not only facilitate travel but also reduce the need to
move. Services, jobs or hobbies must be closer
citizens. The utility offers must be redesigned to become more mobile,
especially in rural areas (see Chapter rurality). Moreover, policy
mobility and territorial development need to be more coordinated.
In parallel, PS advocates enhancing the complementarity between means
transport. This means that every movement must be considered in its
and all it takes maximum ease combined use of several
modes in a same path based on the needs of
each and available offers.
This requires mobility planning and coordination of actors
to provide quality service at the best cost. It should also strengthen
European dialogue between levels of government, federal, regional and local.
In this dynamic, the PS wants to maintain a supply of public transport
sufficient and quality in order to structure mobility. In addition, the
alternative public or private, collective or individual, must be
amplified to meet every need of the most appropriate way.

242

At European level, the SP wants a thorough review of liberalization
Transportation to develop a real sustainable mobility in the service of each
citizen. Liberalization can not be the opportunity of selling the security and
quality, reduce supply, see prices explode or disinvest modes
transportation more environmentally friendly. For this purpose, the PS defends a
strong public regulation and prioritization of the public offer.
This also means that the system of public transport subsidies is
relaxed so that states can continue to invest in infrastructure:
free competition can not be the only goal of an ambitious policy
mobility. Europe also needs to invest in infrastructure and
European transport corridors and harmonize up work rules
in the sector to enhance the mobility of Europeans, the development of
our economy and creating quality jobs.

AND
THE ORGANIZATION S OCIETY TO REDUCE THE NEED
MOVEMENT

In terms of territorial development, the PS proposes to:


improve the mixed use planning to reduce the need for
moving and encourage the use of alternatives to the car (to decrease
distances to services to encourage cycling and walking by
example);



densify living areas, taking into account their urban character or
rural, urban sprawl and streamline, in order to offer
quality transport for all at the lowest cost;



install the service places of employment or priority accommodation
near public transport nodes.

In addition, care must be taken to rethink the organization of our society to
reduce travel and traffic jams. That is why the PS
proposes:


further modulate the arrival and departure times in services
public and private enterprises for workers who wish, in
consultation with unions to avoid that everyone should be
move at the same time in the same places;



study whether the same approach can be applied to schools per zone



promote telework for workers and who wish for
functions that allow, in consultation with the unions;



develop accessible and easily shared offices outside
large cities in order to reduce congestion by providing
quality infrastructure workers outside their workplace



improve the supply of public mobile services, particularly in rural areas.
243

2. P LANNING FOR MOBILITY AS THAT TRAVEL URS
GOODS FOR S

To better coordinate the available supply to the needs of
citizens and businesses, the PS proposes to:


reach a European vision of mobility, which sets priorities for
mobility, which maintains a supply of quality public transport, which
promotes the creation of jobs and activities in this sector, which embodies
the implementation of trans-European transport networks and provides
sufficient financial resources;



implement a plan for the mobility to and from Brussels which incorporates
all levels of political power involved, operators

o also integrating networks fluids (gases, liquids and electricity
in particular) that contribute to the mobility of goods;



encourage all municipalities to implement a municipal level
or supra-municipal mobility coordinated with the regional level and to encourage
stakeholders to implement it;



reinforce travel plans within public administrations,
businesses and schools to better organize mobility

3.1.

STRENGTHENING INTERMODALITY

Mobility should be thinking in terms of moving chain in which
each transport means is used at the appropriate level (the train that ensures
structuring an offer mass to walk that offers a solution
Individual short distance). Complementarity between modes of transport
must be strengthened. This should allow a mobility offering that is better
adapted to the needs, which costs less to the community and individuals who
remains accessible to everyone and that reduces congestion and
environmental impacts. It takes more strengthening passenger information
so they can easily organize their trip and adapt in real time if
necessary.

244

Therefore, the PS proposes to:


create a mobility center for adequate land area
offer personalized information to citizens on all
mobility of the offers available, which will ensure coordination between the
various public and private operators to avoid duplication, and
if necessary propose new mobility services tailored to
realities on the ground in order to allow everyone to move at a cost

IMPROVE PUBLIC TRANSPORT

At the federal level and Walloon (SNCB and TEC), the PS proposes to:


take better account of users' expectations and improve
quality of service, information and punctuality while meeting the
growth in demand;



maintain and adapt social tariff to enable each

STRENGTHENING POLITICAL PATH PEDESTRIAN AND FACILITATE TRAVEL

Cycling and walking are wholly owned means of transport in the
moving chain. The PS wants to develop their practice because they are good
to health, do not pollute and do not contribute to congestion. Finally,
they cost less to public authorities and users than other modes
transport.
To encourage them, the PS proposes to:


continue and expand the plan "bike Wallonia", in connection with the actors



improve information and training of public space managers
so they systematically take into account the needs of cyclists,
pedestrians and bikers.

3.4.

PROMOTING ALTERNATIVES TO PERSONAL CAR

As soon as possible, alternatives to the private car should be
encouraged. This is not to demonize the private car but to set
coherent priorities.
At European level, the SP wants to strengthen environmental standards (standards
Euro) vehicles. Vehicle pollution measures tests must
also be reviewed to better reflect the actual conditions of use.
At the federal level, the PS proposes to offer employees the possibility to replace
their company car for personal use with a "mobility budget" equivalent to
use for other means of transport.

247

In Wallonia, the PS proposes to:


encourage carpooling, pursuing the creation of car parks
main road junctions and other strategic locations in space
public, coordinating carpooling promotion initiatives and
Reflecting on adaptations of traffic, such as book
carpool lanes at certain times of the day;



integrating environmental criteria in road taxes and
circulation, taking care not to penalize citizens who do not have
the means to buy new cars that emit few pollutants and
greenhouse gases.

3.5.

FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF ROAD NETWORK

Promote alternatives to the private car does not preclude the need
provide roads and road service quality to users.
Therefore, the PS proposes to:


complete the rehabilitation operation of the Walloon network and ensure
maintenance;



develop a dynamic traffic management and information system
real-time to improve the use of existing infrastructure and
traffic flow;



increase the capacity of some existing roads, limited in number, but
strategic for the future in terms of economic development and
fluidity;



complete some road improvements to prevent through traffic at
heart of the cities and villages, especially trucks, which is source
danger and noise;



develop plans for parking as a tool for mobility while
preserving free parking for certain categories of users
(residents, health professionals, ...);



promote and regulate access to parking spaces for residents in the
shopping centers or public authorities outside the

opening hours to meet local parking difficulties.

4. THE ENFORCER T RANSPOR R T FREIGHT QUAL ITE
Mobility of goods and logistics are essential pillars
economic development, job creation and innovation of
territory. In this context, Wallonia and Brussels are conveniently located
heart of Europe, close to the most important maritime north European ports.
They also offer interconnected infrastructure networks.
These strengths must be reinforced to provide a transport system
Goods efficient, secure and interconnected between all modes of
transport. This requires developing a strategic vision to be
implemented through the concerted action of all stakeholders, be they
public or private.
The waterway and rail will be used whenever possible. The objective is
to deploy a mobility greener goods
the environment and reduce traffic congestion.
Multimodal nodes must also be strengthened to promote
transfers between transportation. In addition, they are provided for the future
of anchors which can concentrate logistics activities and
job creation. The availability of land around these nodes
Multimodal is a strategic issue.
Finally, at a time when our infrastructure have reached a certain degree of maturity, it
should focus on their maintenance, upgrade and template optimization
their exploitation. Besides thinking mobility of goods
terms of infrastructure availability is not enough: the system must
be considered in a wider vision integrating a set of useful services
economic actors for the delivery of products.
At European level, the PS proposes to:


harmonize the practice of logistics and transport in terms of
Regulatory, infrastructure compatibility, pricing their
use and industry players working conditions, especially
truck drivers;



significantly relax the constraints that prevent states
members to support alternatives to road transport (rail and road

249

development of rail transport and intermodal rail which implies
(see below).
In Wallonia, the PS proposes various actions in terms of planning,
performance of transport modes, intermodal and good management.
4.1.

IMPLEMENTING A MULTIMODAL MOBILITY STRATEGY FOR
FREIGHT TRANSPORT AND LOGISTICS

In Wallonia, the PS proposes to:


implement a "transport and logistics" strategy, which in
form of concrete measures in the short, medium and long term, consistent
with the regional plan for sustainable mobility and the Marshall Plan in 2022, which
will be based on analysis of existing infrastructure and services;



develop a structural regional thinking in logistics
to feed this strategy;



bring together all actors involved in the implementation of
this strategy in an ad hoc structure to ensure success and
develop a common vision and multimodal (that is to say the actors
policies, network managers, the competitiveness cluster
"Logistics in Wallonia", enterprises, carriers and various
logistics service providers);



energize the operation of the Walloon ports to strengthen as
logistics players:
o by fixing their objectives to be achieved;
o by promoting cooperation with the seaports and harbors
interiors of neighboring countries;
o diversifying their activities to the provision of logistics services to
businesses;
o through partnerships with enterprises;
o strengthening coordination between them or merging in some
if it achieves a better capacity for action;



strengthen inter-municipal economic development
they also offer logistics services to companies
coordinated way therebetween.

4.2.

AIM PERFORMANCE FOR EACH OF TRANSPORTATION

In the rail sector, for freight transport, the PS proposes to
Walloon and Federal level:


identify existing industrial connections and pooling between
businesses where possible;



develop a specific service for the treatment of individual wagons and
diffuse traffic management and partnerships with
250

near traffic operators, to support the diffuse traffic
compliance with EU rules more flexible;




continue the implementation of the Euro-Carex project at Liège Airport
which aims to develop rail freight lines for high-speed

For the waterway in Wallonia, the PS proposes to:


the maintenance and the renovation of waterways and large
hydraulic structures;



complete the 9,000 tons template update downstream Meuse
Namur (Ampsin Neuville locks, of Yvoz-Ramet and Lanaye);





implement a Walloon plan for the dredging of waterways and
management of dredgings;



develop the Walloon level the pathways operating European system
waterways and navigation will allow the exchange of information
real time for better traffic management.

In road matters, the PS proposes to:


offer space, security and services for road transport
along the main network (traffic areas, catering services, parking
secure and real-time information);



encourage the use of cleaner lorries, including
through differential pricing according to standards

4.3.

ENSURE INTERMODALITY

To better focus on the complementarity and compatibility between modes
transport, the PS proposes to complete the multimodal platforms park
Planned and especially to develop the potential, using the best
characteristics and the location of each. Therefore, these platforms should
be put in networks and must provide efficient logistics services. A
Particular attention should be paid now, firstly to
the commercial exploitation of these platforms, the other services that are
are available (customs documents and availability of operators and equipment
handling for example).
251

4.4.

DEVELOP EXCELLENCE TO CREATE JOBS DIES

The professions of transport and logistics require skills
Specific to be developed at all levels of training from
secondary school to university. These skills are essential to
the optimal exploitation of our situation and our infrastructure.
That is why the proposed PS:


invest in quality job creation and training, both for
general business (drivers, forklift drivers, handlers) for
more specific profiles (boatman or transport economist).

4.5.

ENSURE AVAILABILITY TERRITORIAL

Job creation and economic activity requires mobilizing spaces
Sufficient nearby infrastructure networks and platforms
multimodal.
For this purpose, the proposed PS:


build and regularly update the inventory, "B-Space", which
centralizes land offers equipped and available for immediate use
for any investor (eg land located along rivers
water will be reserved in priority to companies wishing to
develop their activities in relation to the waterway);



ensure proper use of these spaces are developing activities
and services, while avoiding turn them into storage areas
no added value;



when the inventory of available land is no longer sufficiently expanded
or when they do not meet the specific requirements
investors, provide clear procedures to respond
dynamically to applications within a reasonable time.

4.6.

IMPROVE FREIGHT TRANSPORT IN THE CITY

The issue of urban logistics is a mobilizing issue for the next
years. Additionally to housing, the city must live through different
functions such as trade or production that require inputs and
Output products. It is therefore necessary to manage congestion issues,
road safety and the environment in connection with the mobility of people.
In this context, the proposed PS:


SUSTAINABILITY
"A global agenda for change" was the objective of the
Norwegian first Socialist Minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, when it began
emphasizing the concept of sustainable development, there are more than 25 years,
address the risks posed by an unsustainable global development
long term.
In this line, the PS wants to be a force for social change in order
to ensure the development of all combining social progress, development
economic, environmental and participation of everyone to life
town, in a logic of sustainable development. Faced with the many
crises that our society faces, it is vital to provide
cross answer by rethinking our development model to ensure
the welfare of each and a better future for all.
The PS does not therefore create sustainable development around the only
environmental issue. Indeed, sustainable development requires support
the creation of businesses and local jobs for the citizens, their
well-being, their prosperity, their health and their environment. It's about
an economic opportunity, not a brake.
This dynamic must also and above all help to reduce inequalities
social and not dig, both between North and South and between European citizens,
Belgian and Walloon. Indeed, the first victims of a development
anarchy are often the most vulnerable people. The PS wants therefore
Coherent action without penalizing citizens and workers but
on the contrary, to support them to live well, today and tomorrow.
Social, economic and environmental issues are intertwined. In
this context, the PS calls for a just transition to a society more
concerned about the quality of life of citizens and their quality of life, to a
sustainable society. Each company actor must contribute, at all levels,
the most local to the most global, but governments in particular have a
Triple vital role to play:
 a regulatory role for social justice, economic development
and respect for the environment will not be realized for themselves;
 a social support role so that each winner of this
transition to sustainable development;
 an exemplary role, strengthening policy coherence decisions,
link with the objectives of sustainable development.
In general, the proposed PS:


defend internationally transition to development
which ensures sustainable strong social protection while recognizing also

WTO, OECD, bilateral agreements, etc., by including

o achieve the Walloon strategy to be rebalanced in its

TERRITORIAL DEVELOPMENT
Wallonia has many assets such as its ideal location within
Europe, the available spaces, quality infrastructure and
natural resources. Wallonia is also rich in the diversity of its
territories, whether rural or urban, natural or processed by man.
Under the leadership of the PS, Wallonia has implemented for several years
territorial development policy actions and targeted resources aimed at
enhance these strengths and overcome our weaknesses. Like the Marshall Plans
successive, this strategy is a daily fruit and is now recognized
by all.
For the PS, it is important to continue these efforts while ensuring use
raisonné of the territory and its resources and using their potential to
improve the quality of life of Walloons and amplify the economic redeployment
the benefit of all.
This dynamic should strengthen social cohesion and integrating changes
territorial, demographic and energy of tomorrow, in a logic of
sustainability. Spatial planning should also consider
much more mobility issues to reduce the need for
movement of citizens and the environmental impact of transport.
For this purpose, the SP wants to strengthen the balance and mix of functions offered by the
territory to meet the needs of citizens and businesses. The various
functions to be reconciled are housing, services, including
community facilities, economic activity, businesses and agriculture,
transportation, recreation and natural areas. The PS wants to ensure genuine
territorial regulation that ensures the right balance between the freedom of citizens
and enterprises and the collective interest, between the rights and duties of each.
To strengthen the harmonious development of Wallonia, the PS wants
also declined at the scale of relevant territories that structure our
space the analytical approach, partnership and targeting actions and
means that the success of the regional plans. Wallonia is indeed
composed of a series of subsets each presenting its own
characteristics and its own dynamics.
The ambition is to define for each relevant area of ​​our territory a
adapted strategy that covers all areas of management action
Public to implement a coherent project.
Beyond the general and sectoral objectives applicable to all the territory it
exist in parallel two types of approaches for Wallonia: one
concerns metropolitan and urban areas (the city and its hinterland); the other
relates to rurality. These two approaches are not mutually exclusive. He
may even be that some municipalities are in the combination of tools and
of shares under the two types of approaches development framework
suits them.
The legislature that just ended was marked by two major projects.
On the one hand, it is the updating of the space pattern of development
261

Regional (SDER) that produce a vision for the long term territory. Other
hand, CWATUPE (Walloon Code of spatial planning,
Urban Planning, Heritage and Energy) has been reformed and converted into a
Code for Spatial Development (Codt). This is the toolbox that allows
implementation on the ground, territorial policy. In this context, the PS
defended reforms to facilitate redeployment and the Walloon
simplify procedures for citizens and businesses, ensuring
the balance between public interest and individual interests.
The objectives of the next Parliament will be to complete the two PS
reforms and implement them on the ground, in accordance with the vision
overall planning. In this context, it should identify, with all the
necessary speed, difficulties that may arise and without remedy
neglect the essential stability of the legislative framework. The concrete application of these
two texts is just as essential as their potential for improvement

people and goods and services that develop there);
 a project (or contract) development for each territory, buoyed by
Field actors;
 rules and governance structures to ensure that projects are

These territorial projects from field initiatives must cover
all of Wallonia. Their emergence is based on responsibility
shared between the region - which has an interest in these territories
develop harmoniously - and field players who are guarantors
of taking into account the characteristics of the territory and wishes
people who live there.
The effective development of regional projects requires a change in
modes of governance of public action, which implies, for the PS:
 further collaboration between levels of government;
 mutual reinforcement of sectoral actions;
 the establishment of a more integrated dialogue between public and private actors;
the emergence of territories of communities (see chapter Local Authorities)
charged with carrying a dynamic supra-local development based

S IMPLI PROUD impr ove AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF
OF TERRI TORY SPATIAL AND URBAN PLANNING

TOOL S

Land use planning and urban planning must be effective tools to
service of citizens, businesses and public authorities in order to contribute
development of Wallonia. The new code of territorial development
constitutes the essential lever.
The PS now wants to implement it effectively to ensure rules
clear and stable, by improving it if problems arise. The procedures
will be corrected, if necessary, so that they are workable and simple
and fast as possible, while respecting the general objectives. The roles
each must be well defined. Each actor (citizens and businesses,
communes, intercommunal, regional administration officials delegated,
notaries and architects) must be empowered to participate fully
and effectively to the Walloon development.
In this context, the PS proposes to:

F D EVELOPP ENT AVORISER THE DEPARTURE OF CITIES AND
THEIR AREA OF INFLUENCE

In Wallonia, cities, whether large or small, structure the territory.
They unite around them flows of people, goods and services. They
are an engine of economic development and wealth creation
benefit of the whole Region.
For citizens, the city and its hinterland are a space in which
services, transportation and solidarity can organize themselves
optimal. Reflecting on this scale also allows to take better
account environmental challenges. For businesses, urban areas
have advantages, both for access to jobs that offer information
and diversified services, and innovation or for access to a market
wider. Research proves in this respect that the dynamism of cities and
their hinterland is crucial to ensure the competitiveness of regions.
The future of our territory thus requires a renewed dynamism of its poles
urban.
Cities also face a number of specific challenges such as:
 the development and maintenance of major infrastructure projects which benefit
all such hospital infrastructure, school,
cultural, sports;
 territorial solidarity and the issue of sharing of resources;
 the necessary complementarity between urban spaces and spaces
surrounding rural;
 commercial relocation cells in the periphery and loss
attractiveness ensuing for the centers.
Moreover, a series of challenges take on a very specific dimension
when it comes to large cities, such as:
 social cohesion in particular with the increased phenomena
impoverishment and social exclusion may encounter some of the
urban populations;
 security, mobility, housing, industrialization, quality
housing, the living environment, the environment, the vitality of town centers;
 governance expressed at different levels (districts, communes,
supracommunalité relevant spaces).
The image of our major urban centers is reflected on the whole territory:
strong and attractive cities make an area safe and attractive. The PS wants to
devote specific attention.
Small and medium sized cities are, in turn, face the challenges of
maintain a supply of services qualitatively sufficient to avoid a loss
attractiveness to the detriment of peripheral areas. As such, maintaining,
in the cities of smaller, an acceptable level of employment is a
challenge, including the development of balance of the entire
regional territory.

268

To contribute to these objectives, the PS proposes to:


recognize the structuring of urban spaces and
metropolises, that is to say large cities and their agglomeration, such
defined by the SDER to support regional development;



enjoy the regionalization of the Major Cities Policy
establish, from this device and other policies
existing regional (urban renewal and revitalization, management
city ​​center, ..) an integrated system of support to project

projects by citizens and accentuate the objectives of
project development beyond the physical requalification
neighborhoods;



move towards alignment of the investment spent on subsidies
this territorial policy on those devoted to cities
Rural Development and reserve these credits to meet common
specific criteria proving their urban character.

Furthermore, the proposed PS:


adopt partnership contracts between the Region, the communities of
territories and local authorities (municipalities, CPAS, provinces,
intercommunal) to define the common project
development in connection with the regional organization as a whole,
and tag the coordinated action and the reciprocal commitments
regional and local levels for the duration of the regional legislature;



maintain the concentration of the means of Urban Policy
transferred to the regions in rundown urban neighborhoods
currently supported by ensuring that they are part of the project
Territorial comprehensive of these cities;



give public authorities the tools to plan,

RURALITY
Too often, the perception of rural areas comes down to a recreational place or a
space marked by commuting to the cities, where agriculture
remains the only real economic activity next tourism. Wallonia
Rural however extends far beyond these few shots. It produces
goods and services for the Belgian market and export, and among them,
some jewels of our economy: food, forest products,
tourism products. Furthermore, rural ensures the major part of the
renewable energy production.
It is also noted that rural municipalities, especially the
remote of them, are not spared by poverty. People
elderly but also single parents, and must be at the center
Rural attentions.
Moreover, rural areas combine the handicaps in terms of access to
basic services. Living in rural areas, is often live far from their place of
Working away from public transport, close schools and doctors, far from
mail and shops. It is sometimes difficult to find housing or
yet, for the youngest, with difficulty accessing leisure. Yet access to
these quality services, whether public or private, is a powerful means of
fight against social inequalities. Public services such as providing
services at lower costs, allow to identify the purchasing power for
households.
So the risk is very present of marginalization precarious populations
In a rural area. It is to avoid such inconvenience that the issue of
rural services should be at the heart of concerns.
The challenge is to maintain a living rural areas so that it continues to play
its role in economic and social leverage, while maintaining its quality
environmental, and contributes, alongside regional development and
urban, to the welfare of all without exceptions.
To achieve this, we must provide answers to the various challenges presented by
Rural:
 social cohesion, rural areas being after very urban centers
dense, the second environment where insecurity in our country and concentrated
cohabitation between rural and neo-rural also constituting a
voltage source that calls for answers;
 dispersal habitat, collective source of additional costs and vectors of
certain loss of identity and quality of rural living conditions;
 mobility for all;
 energy and environmental component;
 employment;
 housing, particularly access in some areas, housing
for young families;
 access to public services, emergency services and police and
health care.

271

For the PS, it is first of thinking about development of rural areas in
the characteristics and wishes of its inhabitants and its users.
The project that we support must reflect the realities of rural areas and
the potential it has, and must translate our values ​​of solidarity and
social justice.
The development of rural areas through the provision of tools
serving public and private managers.
In this regard, the PS proposes to:


promote the emergence of supra-local development projects in
rural areas;



continue communal rural development programs (SRCP)
and support all joint wishing to engage in this type
operations;



further studies and analyzes that allow to understand the
sociology and socio-economic dynamics underway in the
rural areas;



ensure the development of agriculture and forestry in
harmony with other activities present in rural areas and the
environmental protection;



integrate the rural dimension into sectoral policies
(see chapters agriculture, economics, mobility, environment, housing,
public services, public service, health, public safety, culture and sport).

As everywhere in Wallonia, access to employment and economic development
constitute the first challenges in rural areas. Increasing employment
endogenous rural is indeed a factor in increasing well-being and
the fight against poverty. It offers a complement to the overall efforts of
economic recovery. It is also a factor of cohesion of the territory.
Finally, it reduces mobility needs, directly and indirectly
found by the attractiveness of the territory for a range of services.
To promote economic development and rural employment,
PS proposes to:


ensure easy access for job seekers and workers to
training, with a reflection on mobility and decentralization
some rural training;



creating small-Home Child Day Care centers nearby
training for job seekers and mobile home teams
for rural or semi-rural areas;



support the creation of craft activities, TPE and SMEs by
creating relay halls, business incubators and other initiatives
rural like;



regulate the development of renewable energy and maximize
local benefits by giving priority to collective projects (support
272

cooperatives) and supporting projects initiated by authorities
premises.
In rural areas, the issue of housing is an important element of attention
well-being of the population. Primarily, two issues are
concern in rural areas: financial affordability in
certain areas of high pressure on land and access to comforts of housing
minimum, especially for the more precarious people.
To improve the quality of habitat in rural areas, the proposed PS:


launch an investment plan for housing development
ensuring the public register in the heart of towns and villages to
bring the services;



encourage owners to develop the undeveloped land within the
central territories, including those located in rural areas;



promote the principle of lease for households
modest and average incomes, especially in areas
high land prices;



encourage practical solutions to share costs
related to housing, such as colocation, solidarity habitat or
solidarity between cohabiting people, and are particularly
adapted to rural areas.

Physical distance and low population densities LEAD
also problems of access to certain services, public and private. It
increases the existing phenomena of precariousness and impairs the attractiveness of
rural territories. The PS defends equality of users before the public service,
but that does not necessarily mean uniformity of service. In order to ensure
equality of access, specific solutions to the rural environment should be
developed.
In access to services, the PS proposes to:


support the creation of village houses that can accommodate
local cultural or festive activities and can also become the place
gathering of youth organizations, seniors or dating
all;



maintain a quality postal service, accessible to all, while
preserving the role of the factor in maintaining social ties;



promote rural development securely (public lighting,



population;

In terms of mobility, the PS proposes to:


create a mobility center for adequate land area that will offer
personalized information to citizens on all deals
mobility available, which will ensure coordination between the different
public and private operators to avoid duplication, and which will
work if any new mobility services tailored to
rural realities in order to allow everyone to move at a cost
affordable (social taxi on demand, car pooling or rental
Car and bike for example);



continue to operate small SNCB lines providing routes in
rural areas;



maintain a public offering of quality and reorganize the offers by TEC
area according to the actual demand to respond more effectively
citizens' needs, combining the express lines, the lines
classic, school lines and local bus;



support collective taxis and taxis social demand, to
complete the offer of public transport and thus maintain social ties in
if necessary developing partnerships between TEC and powers
premises.

General medical care is particularly difficult to achieve in
rural areas: the distances are important, access to a set
skilled providers, including dental care, and remains problematic
doctors are too few and must take several guards
night per week while they also work day.
To remedy this, the PS proposes to:


expand as quickly as possible to the country number
single telephone 1733 that directs the patient to the most solution
adequate: visit the GP, go to a post
guard, hospital emergencies, etc. ;



create 45 additional guard posts;



supporting the ability of GPs to conclude a
agreement with an emergency service to ensure the night shifts;



encouraging especially in rural areas, the creation of medical homes
strengthening social funding and by including dentists
274

(in addition to doctors, physiotherapists and nurses (s) who perform there
already present).
In order to support social cohesion, the PS proposes to:


strengthen coordination and synergies between CPAS to promote
standardization of practices and promotion of good practices
could improve the service provided to citizens and streamline
the costs and administrative burdens, especially in the context of basins
common life;



in terms of permanent habitat, increase the number of upstream
decent housing at affordable prices and develop alternatives.

In terms of environment and quality of life, the PS proposes to:


strengthen actions implemented in order to preserve the nature and
landscapes, and restore biodiversity;



intensify the fight against invasive alien species;



amplify the role of parks and cross-border cooperation to
to reconcile the preservation of nature, human activities and activity
tourism through consultation with all social and economic stakeholders and the local population;



strengthening river contracts that allow social management,
balanced economic and environmental rivers and their
different uses in consultation with local people and stakeholders
concerned.

275

AGRICULTURE
For the PS, agriculture plays a central role in our economy in terms of
producing good quality food but also in terms of maintaining
economic activity in rural areas. Farmers are a crucial link
rural areas and, as such, it is to involve them fully in the
reforms that affect them. Despite the essential tasks that make
farmers to society, many of them are in a situation today
precarious. Employment in the sector has been declining under the political effect
agricultural inappropriate and detrimental to business creation. It is now
rehabilitate the profession of farmer, accompanying it to become a
real rural entrepreneur. Particular attention should be paid to
the situation of young farmers in order to create jobs again in
agriculture.

1.

MPROVING THE S TATUS AND INCOME AG RICULTEURS

For the PS, we must improve farmers' income, particularly that
Breeders who are those who suffer most today. This requires
including through a rebalancing of direct payments in the new policy
Common Agricultural (CAP) that is emerging at European level. PS made
improving the income of farmers a priority and intends to do the
the first premium hectares a reality.
In addition to increasing their income, it must be attentive to improve
quality of life of farmers. Farmers have a rhythm of life exhausting.
There are many workload problems, resulting
ill-being and family tensions.
PS proposes to:


establish a more egalitarian redistribution of aid
direct (CAP);



set up a monitoring to assess the impact of the aid reform
direct (CAP 1st pillar) and in any case, conduct an inventory after
two years to make the adjustments necessary mid-term;



give an ambitious content of the concept of "active farmer" for
favoring real farmers, that is to say those who work the land
or raise livestock, which create jobs;





Furthermore the use of traditional agricultural replacement services,
set up a system allowing farmers to use
the mobile workforce in order to save themselves time off without
compromising operations management.

R deform ACCESS TO THE AFI N LAND OF PROMOTING
Installatio PREMIERE N

For the PS, we must curb the phenomenon of disappearance of small farms
which are swallowed by larger, destroying jobs and destabilizing the
rural areas (consequence of the current CAP in particular). The PS wants
promote the first installation and better regulate land prices so that
the latter is related to the expected fruits of their operation. There
transmission of agricultural enterprises and expertise must also be
further facilitated by public support for young people to resume
exploitation.
In this perspective, the PS proposes to:

facility to allow those who want to go to find
financial resources and support required;



facilitate the transfer of expertise and of agricultural enterprises by
improving farmers' access to mechanisms such as

rural entrepreneurs to be supported by the development of a
specific support, especially to better inform and simplify
administrative procedures.
For this purpose, the proposed PS:


decompartmentalize and encourage collaboration between the agricultural sector and
players in the economic leadership (Walloon Agency for Enterprise and
innovation) to offer the possibility to rural entrepreneur to be



to change the controls of the Federal Agency for the Safety of

ALORISER V THE ROLE OF GENERAL INTEREST BY PLAY
FARMERS

For the PS, farmers perform many functions extremely
useful in our society such as the production of quality food,
energy production (biomass, biogas, renewable energy, etc.),
preserving the environment and biodiversity (grassland maintenance
forests, rivers, landscape maintenance, etc.).
Our region is also full of quality local products, like the
diversity of terroirs, the result of know-how of its farmers and its
artisans. For the PS, it is appropriate to strengthen the identification and recognition of
Walloon products, expand market share, both in Belgium
export, developing a coherent strategy with tools
effective promotion and enjoying stable funding.
PS proposes to:


fight against the shortage of veterinarians in rural areas by setting
relationship of the academic world with the agricultural world to better
identify needs and offer internships to students;



fight against the breakdown of service providers fabric
agriculture in rural areas;



recognize the public utility nature of agricultural activities and more
inform the public about them (what is done in such a period, therefore,
pollution, etc.);
278



increase opportunities with public institutions for
local products by the increasing use of social clauses and
environmental in public procurement enabling
communities to source from local producers;



support the use of local produce in schools and canteens
administrations;



create a trademark for differentiated quality that allows the
consumer to identify the origin of the product and its features
own (intrinsic quality, production methods, etc.);



develop specifications, clear and precise, controlled by
independent bodies attesting to the differentiated quality
products;



encourage and continue recording of local products in
European (protected designation of origin, geographical indication
protected);



strengthen relations between farmers, processors, distributors and
Consumer coordinated actions, ensure
transparency of value chains;



promote the conclusion of cooperation agreements between the large
distribution and specialist retailers to turn to local produce

Local products of differentiated quality (gourmet rallies, markets
soil, etc.) and intensify the development of short circuits in the
distribution of agricultural products;



develop joint initiatives with the tourism sector
develop the sale of local products to that specific customer.

TOURISM
Provider of non-relocatable jobs in the catering industry, culture, transport
or trade, tourism is a sector in Wallonia
the important economic development potential. Its growth implies
working mainly on two projects: a better development of
tourism assets on the one hand and a professionalisation and optimization
the second sector.

The Walloon tourism sector has strong growth potential. His
development will necessarily involve the establishment of a policy
coherent including better worker training, technical support
increased to operators, an optimization of investments and
rationalization of public actors.
PS proposes to:


strengthen the training of workers in the sector, by organizations
Traditional Training (Forem, IFAPME, education) but
also economic stimulus organizations like
chambers of commerce and industry or the intermunicipal

HERITAGE
Heritage in Wallonia, it is primarily a great business card for
our region.
Restored, well maintained monuments and sites involved in the foundation
a quality brand that can benefit citizens. They
also represent an important asset in terms of quality of life with
investors, Belgian and foreign, likely to integrate this dimension in
the location of their investment. The
label "World Heritage
Humanity "assigned or about to be in many goods classified
Wallonia gives them unparalleled visibility abroad. You have to press
awareness of these sites to boost the economic and cultural sector
affected areas (hotels, museums, restaurants) and carry forward the image
positive brand they release.
Heritage restoration is an essential tool requalification
Urban. It must still be emphasized to contribute to the revival of
urban centers. Many monuments lend themselves relatively easily to
reallocation in housing or offices.
These witnesses of history must also be able to contribute more strongly to
strengthen the development of cultural tourism. This does not translate
Only through the creation of museums in classified monuments. It may
also take the form of classified and restored theaters that
welcome quality programming, but also of accessibility
classified sites that reflect our rich industrial past.
To realize this potential, the PS proposes to:


stimulate further maintenance current approach of classified assets
to avoid having to undertake costly and cumbersome campaigns
restoration by strengthening the maintenance policy of heritage
could take the form, as the experience in the Netherlands, a
Regional team to go into the field and advise
owners in a preventive, non-binding approach;



better program interventions on the public heritage,
encouraging the conclusion of agreements with the municipalities and provinces,
to jointly identify priority investments
their territory, in particular as regards the churches, often
disused or abandoned and located in the heart of urban centers,
must be able to find an assignment;



encourage the reallocation of assets classified policy, including
facilitating public-private partnerships, but also by strengthening
devices for combining multiple policies (heritage,
housing, site remediation, rehabilitation and urban revitalization,
energy ...) and through innovation in the types of possible reallocations
Based on the Institute of Walloon Heritage whose advisory role in
reallocation will be expanded to the monuments that are not yet
considered at risk;
282



pay particular attention to the renovation operations and
reassignment of classified industrial heritage that can accommodate usefully
new economic activities;



develop a strategy classification of new goods, prioritized on
the basis of objective criteria to distinguish what really falls
of regional interest or beyond (see World Heritage) to which a
local scope;



redesignate the existing classification arrested for consistency in
both by streamlining rankings (review the scope of
ranking downgrade when no member having founded
classification exists) and a focus on the goods that have
undeniable heritage features;



think about alternative financing methods, such tax support
sponsorship of heritage, which would encourage investors to
carry out investment projects in the restoration of monuments
classified enjoying preferential tax treatment for amounts
invested;



develop a network of competence centers incorporating a
orientation Heritage Skills, led by the Centre
Heritage Skills and training institutes, particularly to
develop expertise on energy performance of buildings
old, including listed buildings;



expand youth awareness policy by strengthening
field experiences with the sector of technical education and
Professional and alternation instruction allowing these
students to discover this deposit skilled jobs but also



improve the conditions of access to public markets for our craftsmen



encourage the renovation of the small Walloon Popular Heritage;



amplify synergies between policies of heritage and tourism
Wallonia, the definition of common projects;



increase collaboration with the Wallonia-Brussels Federation to link
these joint projects in cultural policy, including expanding
tourism cooperation agreement heritage / culture 2008 to
professionalize the common approach and integrate the dimension of
the reception of tourists in the design of reallocation projects



rely more on the iconic heritage elements, such



consider the transfer to the Region, and the COCOF, relative competence
Movable Heritage to ensure policy coherence

ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE
Protecting the environment and climate are major issues for the
PS because they directly affect our quality of life, now and for
future generations. This is a fundamentally more social question, because
are often the most vulnerable who suffer the most
environmental degradation. These are often the people least
favored living in the most polluted areas, in areas where the
road heavy traffic or in areas without green spaces. The
environmental inequalities are also social inequalities.
The preservation of our environment also offers many opportunities
Business, including local, to create employment and activity
Economic. It is also an opportunity for them to become more competitive
using less natural resources.
Provide a healthier environment for citizens and workers will in
Also reduce health costs for individuals and powers
public, and help improve the well-being at work and to reduce
absenteeism.
Of course, this legitimate desire to preserve the environment and the climate
should not lead to new social inequalities or curb redeployment
Economic. Everyone must contribute according to his means and his
responsibility, and everyone should benefit equally.
The authorities have therefore a critical role to play in terms of
regulation and support of the most vulnerable citizens to promote a
development that is socially, economically and environmentally.
Governments should also lead by example, as to speed
change to reduce their own costs.
In this context, the key issues are climate change, the quality
air, biodiversity and nature, waste, product standards and
impact on health and the environment, management of soil and water, and the fight
against flooding.

climate change reinforce inequalities between North and South,
rich and poor. The most vulnerable populations are the first victims
the consequences of global warming as they are the least
officials. This fight however, can not be the basis of new
inequalities. The fight against climate change is also an opportunity
improve air quality, since the measures to be implemented are often
joint.

285

At all levels of power, the international level down to the local level,
PS proposes to:


contribute to the conclusion of a binding global climate agreement
2015 to limit the increase in global temperature
maximum 1.5 ° C to 2 ° C and ensure the success of the Paris Summit in 2015;



Register at the heart of future global agreement the goal of a just transition and
towards a sustainable society that emits few greenhouse gases and
consumes less raw materials; which requires to ensure
social support for more fragile and workers and
ensuring economic activity in order to make it acceptable change;



set an ambitious and realistic climate strategy, with steps
intermediaries in 2030 and 2040 to 2050 that reduces
emissions of greenhouse gas from Europe to 80-95% in 2050
compared to 1990 and which is based on the following principles:
o assess the costs and social benefits (including in terms of
health), economic and environmental measures to be

o be based on a fair distribution of effort and coordination
effective, both between each European Member State, on the other
between the regions and the federal state;
o be declined in each region (Wallonia, this will be done by the
Map-air climate and energy will be improved if necessary) and
strengthening the role of local authorities;
o based on the efforts of the federal government that are to come strengthen
regional actions (mainly in terms of transport, energy
renewable in the North Sea, product standards and taxation);
o be coordinated between all actors of society and
mobilize citizens through positive communication oriented
on the right moves to implement;
o ensure consistency between the emission reduction policies
of greenhouse gas effect, building savings



realize the support to developing countries to help them
face the consequences of global warming and the fight against
deforestation;



prepare now the adaptation to changes

health, agriculture, fisheries and forestry).

286

Especially at European level, the PS proposes to:


reform the gas emission trading system for greenhouse order

socio-economic impacts and to better regulate this system
eliminate fraud;



establish a correction mechanism at the borders of the Union

Biodiversity and nature affect us all. They contribute in effect
our quality of life and offer many "public services" and
resources must be accessible to everyone. This course aims spaces
and natural landscapes, but also the quality of water and food we
consume, natural resources such as wood and stone, access to
outdoor recreation or drugs and cosmetics that
are made from natural products.
Nature therefore has an environmental role, but also social, health and
PS economical than keen to preserve. This biodiversity is a source of
progress must be strengthened and whose use must be sustainable and for the benefit of
all. We must also make better known to the public and to all
public and private socioeconomic stakeholders the benefits of biodiversity and
need to protect.
2.1.

PRESERVING BIODIVERSITY AND NATURE

At all levels of power, the PS proposes to:


strengthen the strategy and concrete actions implemented to
preserve nature, actually halt the decline of biodiversity and if
can restore it to 2020, from the local level to
International;



continue and expand the plan "bees" coordinated with all the
stakeholders and different levels of power, and to promote
within schools and community groups in the creation of a hive
including educational purposes;



whether plant or animal, and develop a management strategy
new pets (tarantulas, snakes, etc.),
coordinated between levels of power;



strengthen controls to reduce the illegal trade in animals,
plants and wood protection;



better define sustainability criteria for biomass based on its
287

uses to ensure that the environmental impact is positive and
its operation does not affect the rights of workers
(biofuels, palm oil, wood and natural waste for example).
At the Walloon level, the PS proposes to:


promoting access for all to nature, notably by enhancing spaces
greens and nearby places of walks and leisure, especially
in neighborhoods that have few;



encourage collective and communal vegetable gardens and involve
citizens and local associations in order to promote their management
biodiversity, recreation and social diversity;



continue the development of nature reserves and the program
Natura 2000 - which constitute a network of sites to protect and which are
key biodiversity management tools - strengthening
dynamic partnership between public authorities, associations and
owners of the sites;



implement the "Wallonia nature" by evaluating the social impacts,
economic and environmental and the measures proposed by
focusing on the most effective measures at the lowest cost;



improve the mobilization of citizens and public and private stakeholders
for the preservation of nature and biodiversity by promoting
provision of clear information and shared management
(especially by the river contracts, municipal plans

Urban);



make awareness of nature and biodiversity accessible
all students in primary and secondary education;



amplify the role of parks and cross-border cooperation to
to reconcile the preservation of nature and human activities
tourism through consultation with all social and economic stakeholders and the local population;



develop environmental linkages (eg forests,
parks, natural areas, hedges and trees, late mowing zones,
rivers, marshes and ponds) on the Walloon region to improve the
biodiversity and the living environment, increase tourism and recreation and,
as regards water, to better fight against flooding;



reconcile agricultural development and environmental preservation
and biodiversity.
2.2.

ENSURING A BALANCED FOREST MANAGEMENT

PS proposes to:


ensure the balance of the various uses of the forest they are recreational,
social, economic and environmental;



continue to adapt forests to climate change by
planting of appropriate tree species;
288



maintain the economic role of forests and their potential for job
including ensuring a balance between hardwood and softwood and
preserving industry linked to logging quality;



encourage use of the most job-creating wood and give
Priority wood used as material, particularly in the areas of
construction and furnishing, compared to wood used as
fuel.
2.3.

PROMOTING AND PROTECTING FISHING RIVERS

PS proposes to:


strengthening river contracts that allow social management,
balanced economic and environmental rivers and their
different uses in consultation with local people and stakeholders
concerned;



ensure dialogue and effective collaboration between the actors

social cohesion and environmental education, establishing a
framework and tools for the development of this activity;



improve the promotion of fishing, especially with regard to youth;



preserve aquatic environments and native species.
2.4.

ENSURING SUSTAINABLE HUNTING

Hunting is an essential activity in Wallonia. It is necessary to balance
nature and biodiversity. Its weight in the Walloon economy
major (mainly via the catering, sales of food products,
tourism and rental of hunting grounds). Finally, for many
Commons is a primary source of financial income.
This legislature has been marked by a stigma in the world of hunting
particularly because of certain excesses for intensive feeding of
big game.
That is why the proposed PS:


mend dialogue between hunters and the authorities either
Walloon through the Supreme Council of the hunting associations
representative of the sector;

ROMOTING AGEME P A N S SUSTAINABLE WASTE

Waste production and disposal have a major impact on our
environment and health of citizens. Many efforts have been made
to produce less waste and recycle more. Wallonia is
also one of the most successful European regions in this field.
About 97% of household waste and 90% of industrial waste is
valued. For the PS, it is important to extend this action to strengthen
European hierarchy of waste management. It is aimed primarily
reducing the amount of waste generated and sorting allowing
reuse and recycling, energy recovery from waste and, last
use, disposal.
That is why the proposed PS:


provide product standards (European or federal priority if
required) that reduce the amount of waste generated and
overpack;


encourage the use of recycled products, particularly in
and public procurement markets at all levels of power, while respecting
citizens' health and the environment, while maintaining a
specific framework to prevent abuse;



improve control of the various operators and sectors, and aim to
Priority illegal actors in the waste sector (metals, textiles and
electronics in particular) to reduce risks
public health and the environment.

Especially in Wallonia, the PS proposes to:


strengthen social measures for the benefit of the most vulnerable households
to reduce the cost of invoice;



evaluate the mechanism of "cost-truth" and apply a tax on
waste that is balanced to ensure a fair cost to households and
Business for the treatment of their waste while giving
priority to the most environmentally friendly techniques;



Walloon develop a new plan for the waste management:
o taking into account existing tools and future needs;
o ensuring the best service at the best price for citizens;
o better protecting the health and environment;
o strengthening partnerships between operators, whether private and
290

public and by enrolling in a circular approach to the economy
based on the Walloon program "NEXT";
o using sparingly public budgets available;


reduce the amount of waste produced by providing a prevention component
ambitious waste in this Plan:
o involving the public authorities, which must set an example in the
material, field actors, recovery bonds (this is
approved organizations that organize the recovery of certain wastes such
as packaging or batteries) and businesses (eg
supermarkets regarding food waste);
o diversifies actions beyond simple communication
promoting global projects (eg redistribution
unsold food), fighting against all the waste and
enhancing the repair and reuse of products;
o to continue preventive actions in schools;
o which provides for performance contracts to be concluded with actors
Prevention;



continue raising awareness of citizens, public authorities and
companies of the importance of sorting;



encourage the recovery of organic waste in a manner adapted to
each local situation;



enhance the attractiveness of waste treatment Walloon tools - both
public and private - in order to create jobs, and improve profitability
reduce costs for the benefit of citizens and businesses;



invest in R & D and innovation in terms of reusability,
recycling and waste treatment;



develop new sectors including reuse and
recycling of construction waste, electronic waste,
rare earth, hard plastics and hazardous materials to
create local jobs and use resources sparingly
natural;



continue to promote the social economy in the waste sector,
coordination with classical economics, and encourage projects targeting
training and rehabilitation;



better coordinating the policies of waste and soil management,
particularly in relation to the recovery of waste and methods
pollution analysis.

MPROVING STANDARDS FOR PRODUCTS TO REDUCE
THEIR IMPACT ON H EALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

The influence of the environment on health is a key factor that suffers
sometimes a lack of information. For the PS, it is essential to improve the

291

living environment for all citizens and enable clear information
regarding the consequences of certain consumer choices.
Promote standards of products that better meet the health and
the environment is an effective means in this context so as to act
cross (indoor and outdoor pollution, electromagnetic waves and
noise). It is also to regulate a range of new technologies
the development of which should not be hindered if it is beneficial, but box
in order to promote reasonable use.
This also requires further research to better understand the effects
on health and the environment of these technologies and other products
potentially harmful and favor alternatives if necessary.
PS The last wishes to strengthen the coordination of actions on
environmental health at every level of government in order to strengthen
efficiency.
4.1.

REGULATE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND HARMFUL SUBSTANCES

The PS wants to act at all levels of power and if possible at the most level
General to provide the broadest protection.
On pesticides and chemicals, the PS proposes to:


accelerate and facilitate the implementation of the European REACH
(which seeks to control chemicals);



more control over the products placed on the market:
o reducing the size of the bottles sold to individuals and
prohibiting the most harmful substances;
o better training professionals in their use;



use non-toxic alternatives instead of pesticides in
public places, in consultation with workers not to make their
more painful labor;



improve the protection of workers in sensitive sectors,
particularly in SMEs and among the self (laundries, salons
hairdressing, farmers ...)



register products containing nanomaterials (substances
microscopic that are used in a variety of products
consumer) and generalize this system at European level,
to ensure transparency in relation to consumers and
workers and to better assess the risks to public health;



establish the criteria for classifying disruptive
endocrine (hormonal substances that disrupt the functioning and
deteriorating human health) and launching a European action program
2020 to control these substances.

292

In telecommunications technology, the PS proposes to:


give accurate information concerning the waves emitted by GSM,
smartphones and other telecommunications technology to
encourage their rational use, and to limit their sale to children;



assess the health impact of these technologies and antennas
transmitters to ensure adequate protection for all citizens
ensuring quality access to new technologies and
avoiding slow economic development.

On GMOs, the PS wants to maintain a specific monitoring
supervise their potential effects on health and environment.
The socio-economic impact of GMOs in the future should also be taken into
account to assess their added value for society.
That is why the proposed PS:


ensure systematic labeling of products containing GMOs or
from animals that had a GMO-based food, so
ensure vis-a-vis transparency of the consumer;



maintain public expertise so that knowledge
GMOs are not only the private domain and thus ensure
effective regulation for the benefit of citizens;



review the functioning of the National Biosafety Advisory Council to
to provide a scientific committee which will decide on the risks to
health and the environment of GMO issues and an advisory committee that
positioned on other aspects of order ethical or socio-economic.
4.2.

REDUCE POLLUTION INDOOR

We spend about 90% of our time indoors. Or,
because of better insulation and higher maintenance products and
the particular furniture, indoor air contains more substances
chemical, sometimes harmful.
To improve air quality, the PS proposes to the European and federal level
of:


continue setting standards for construction materials,
components of furniture and other household items, and products
chemical for domestic use;



regulate the sale and labeling of interior and deodorants
fragrances (scented candles, incense sticks or
incense burner) to limit the emissions of substances or allergens
irritating (particularly benzene or fine particles).

At regional and community level, the PS proposes to:


improve the knowledge of the air quality diagnostic system
within private homes;
293



inform citizens about the harmful effects of certain materials or
products and promote the use of best available techniques;



develop projects in collaboration with the sensitive sectors
(crèches, schools, hospitals and nursing homes primarily) to
reduce or eliminate the use of potentially harmful products and
raise awareness of the need to air regularly on the premises;



fight against the risks linked to asbestos strengthening monitoring
asbestos buildings and supporting the asbestos removal, especially
when there is a health risk and in settings that host
children;



reducing carbon monoxide poisoning by strengthening
prevention and maintenance of the installations (boilers and
including water heaters).
4.3.

PROMOTING PRODUCTS MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY

At all levels of power, the PS proposes to:


gradually introduce product labeling data
standardized for their environmental and social footprint order
that the public can choose in full knowledge of the facts;



make clearer information about the sorting of the label
products;



set standards for products that they consume less energy
and water, they emit less harmful substances or waves for
health and the environment and progressively restrict market access
the least efficient products while controlling their price;



further reflection on product design and management
their life cycle, with business, to promote the
development of circular economy, that is to say, which consumes
fewer resources and favors the reuse and recycling;



fight against planned obsolescence of products by lengthening
warranty periods and improving after-sales services (possibility
repair mainly).
4.4.

COMBAT NOISE

PS proposes to:


establish at European level (federal or if necessary) standards for
limit the noise from various products, vehicles and construction equipment and
provide for a specific labeling;



improve the protection of sensitive areas identified on mapping
noise and define the perimeters of actions and priority actions
(coatings and other road schemes in particular).

294

C OMBATTRE INFRACT ION THE ENVIRONMENTAL

At all levels of power, the SP wants to improve the fight against
environmental violations in order to improve the health of citizens,
usability and quality of our living environment. This is also to ensure the rules
Fair game for businesses.
For this purpose, the proposed PS:


prioritize the most problematic in terms of offenses
health of residents and impact on the environment and the economy;



strengthen the fight against illegal dumping and incineration
home;



strengthen coordination, both between European states on the other
between the municipalities, the regions, the federal government, customs, police and
justice.

6.

D EPOLLUER SOILS

For the PS, soil remediation is a key lever of development
Wallonia is threefold:


strengthen the region's attractiveness by offering new courses
"Recycled", primarily in urban and rural centers, to limit
urban sprawl;



improve public health and quality of life;



remove brownfields that degrade the landscape.

In this context, governments have a role to play in strengthening
the attractiveness of the areas that are most affected and ensure treatment
Fair territories and their inhabitants.
In addition, soil pollution is not just about brownfields.
Some regions are also heavily affected by pollution
historical, including where there has been no industrial activity (embankment, land
alluvial loaded with heavy metals, including accidental pollution
authors are gone ...).
The decree "soil" that organizes the management of soils and their pollution is
an essential tool for action. It has just been revised and now has to be executed
effectively.
That is why the proposed PS:


implement the decree "soil" of the clearest and most
practicable as possible for the benefit of all users and priority
citizens and businesses, by providing steps to allow time
field workers to adapt and improve the rules if
required;
295



to reflect on the degree of requirement for pollution control,
which better reflects the territory concerned, the type of pollution and
type of function that will host this space cleared, without compromising
public health imperatives;



promote best possible techniques to ensure
sufficient and faster remediation at the best cost for
landowners and public authorities;



expand the activities of the soil remediation funds stationsservices (BOFAS funds) to help individuals repair their field
polluted by an oil tanker, based on their income;



continue the remediation of polluted sites in the strategic framework
Marshall Plan in 2022 to provide new well located land for
economic development projects, with emphasis on sites
which concrete projects are already planned and those constituting a
serious threat to health and the environment;



establish a Walloon plan for the dredging of waterways and management
dredging sludge to promote inland mobility;



develop an integrated treatment system and reclamation of land
polluted land and construction in order to enhance the activity
Economic and create local jobs;



reconcile the objectives of decontamination and rapid recovery in activity
during the economic bankruptcy of enterprises located on polluted soils.

G Erer WATER EFFICIENT AND SUSTAINABLE

For the PS, water is a vital resource to which access must be guaranteed to all
Walloons. The right to water passes both the mastery of price by support
Citizens who know the most difficulties facing their bill.
The second objective is to ensure a sustainable development of the sector
water. This means promoting a rational use of water and
maintain good quality of resources, underground and surface,
distributing the water management costs fairly among all users.
The third objective is to ensure an efficient and transparent functioning of the
water sector and maintaining a fully public management "cycle
water "(collection, distribution, drainage and sewage) to ensure water
quality to the benefit of citizens and professionals.
At European level, the PS refuses any liberalization. he is also
important to maintain an ambitious policy to protect resources
while strengthening the right to water and contributing to the socioeconomic development of Europe.
7.1.

ENSURING EQUITABLE ACCESS TO WATER

The PS wants to ensure a fair price that allows everyone to provide any water
financing expenses management and remediation of water needed
296

to meet the quality objectives defined at European level. Rising
water prices can not lead to a two-tier society in which
some could not pay their water bills.
That is why the proposed PS:


ensure effective control of the water prices, following the regionalization
competence, to ensure the mastery of the price while ensuring
quality service to the community;



broaden access to the social fund of the water, which helps citizens to pay their
water bill ;



rational water resource protection and equitable distribution
costs among all users;



regulate private water intakes to prevent further privatization
the resource, strengthen solidarity between users and allow
more coherent and sustainable management of resources across the country.
7.2.

PROMOTING WATER QUALITY OF ALL PROFIT

The water is much needed both citizens and professionals. A water
good condition also contributes to the landscape and environment quality
Wallonia and the safe practice recreation (fishing, swimming and
other water sports). A harmonious development of the water cycle
will be possible by guaranteeing access for all to water, both for drinking only
for fun, while protecting water quality and ecosystems. This
dynamic must also contribute to the Walloon economic development and
local employment quality.
To achieve this, the proposed PS:


maintain a high degree of quality of tap water;



continue sensitizing citizens to inform the good quality
of tap water and the importance of not throwing waste in
WC ;



continue the implementation of district management plans
Hydrographic coordinated with stakeholders with a view
to achieve the water quality objectives:
o

ensuring sufficient resources and planning the best
investments and measures to achieve to meet the
European deadlines;

o

including, for sub-basin, the priority to the most action
effective at the lowest cost;

o
maintaining a level of activity and employment in sufficient
sanitation sector;

o

ensuring equitable distribution of efforts between citizens,
businesses and farmers;
297

distributing loads evenly between them;



continue the protection of aquatic environments and biodiversity;



reconcile the development of agriculture and water protection in
particularly as regards the agricultural nitrate.
7.3.

ENSURING EFFECTIVE PUBLIC MANAGEMENT AND WATER SECTOR

The SP insists on maintaining a fully public management of water, as it
This is a much too important to be considered as a simple
commodity. The PS also wants to ensure efficient and transparent operation
the sector. To this end, we must strengthen coordination between operators
Walloon. Partnerships must also be developed with Brussels and the
border countries.
PS proposes to:


ensure effective regulation of the water sector, both from a point of view
economic and technical;



conclude a cooperation agreement between Brussels and Wallonia
ensure sound management of resources;



develop collaborations with neighboring countries to value
Walloon resources and create employment in the sector;



strengthen partnerships and voluntary mergers between players
in the water industry.

AGAINST THE UTTER INO NDATIONS

Flooding can be a real calamity for citizens. The
Global warming may also strengthen these phenomena. For
avoid or at least reduce the effects requires a strong response and
cross.
That is why the proposed PS:


improve information to citizens about the risks of the
near a river or a run-axis;



edit personal protective tips guide to flooding
to reduce the damage to citizens;
298



strengthen coordination between Wallonia, the other Regions, the
provinces and municipalities concerned to intensify the fight



promote an integrated approach to watershed scale in
coordinating stakeholders, also in times of crisis (Regions,
provinces, municipalities, ...);



improving regional support to municipalities to strengthen the efficiency and
the consistency of their actions;

floods and natural water cycle;



implement preventive measures, even in areas
remote streams as well as upstream waterways to mitigate
the effects of heavy rainfall and reduce runoff and erosion
land (include specific measures for land
territory, favoring grassy ditches along the roads, promote
good agricultural practices, restore wetlands ...);



encourage managers to maintain different streams of
suitably;



strengthen dialogue with farmers to reduce the risk of
mudslides, mainly through river contracts;



systematize the cost-effectiveness analyzes of the actions to be taken to
to better use the available budgetary resources.

299

ANIMAL WELFARE
To improve the welfare of animals, the PS proposes to:


support and promote the national and international levels, pathways
and farmers who go beyond the current standards for
producing, among others, laying hens, chickens, rabbits
meat or swine;



encourage the inclusion of specific clauses in favor of products
respectful of animal welfare in the specifications used
canteens in schools;



limiting animal experiments strictly necessary, stimulate
developing reliable alternative methods, especially with regard
experiments involving sensitive species, intensify checks
laboratories, attaching great attention to assessing
retrospective experiments, especially the most painful;



carry to completion the implementation of cats sterilization plan, which provides
the prospects for lasting solution to overcrowding in shelters
while bringing a respectful response of animal welfare in
problem of stray or feral cats status;



strengthen the breeding standards of dogs, and control, to fight
against genetic diseases, marketing of animals poorly
prepared for life in society, aggressive or ill, farms
clandestine, illegal trade, particularly on the Internet ...;



prohibit the raising fur animals;



ensure that the rules on the keeping of animals in
zoos and circuses are correct and updated
according to the evolution of knowledge;



raise awareness, especially students, to the issue of animal welfare and abuse to animals.

Finally, the PS, it is important that the EU adopts strategy
ambitious in terms of animal welfare and which is limited to animals
pension but also provides pets.
Internationally, he finally agreed to continue to advocate for a more
respect for animals, especially those whose existence is threatened by
hunting, poaching, overfishing, or the gradual disappearance of their
habitat.

ENERGY
Energy is a basic necessity. No one can live in dignity
without a minimum of heating, electricity or means to move.
For the PS, access to energy is a right for every citizen. This request
action at four levels: controlling energy prices, reduce
consumption significantly while maintaining a quality of life equivalent
or improving it, better inform and protect consumers and support
Citizens who know the most difficulties facing their bill. In parallel,
PS keen to ensure energy supply of our country in all
circumstance.
Attention should also be paid to companies and professionals
that energy can sometimes be a very significant load, which then
the money spent could be used to create jobs, train
workers and invest in innovation.
Our energy consumption also has an impact on the environment and
contributes to global warming. The social and
our economic consumption is not negligible. The PS
calls for changing our energy behavior in a sustainable approach,
reconciling social progress and solidarity, economic development and
respect for our living environment, the benefit of citizens and businesses. It
also contribute to meeting our international climate objectives in.
For this purpose, the PS prioritization on the reduction of the energy consumption
both for individuals and professionals. Governments
should also be copies. This strategy will strengthen our independence
energy, as the development of renewable energies must
be continued by taking into account the potential of each of the streams and their
social, economic and environmental impact. Renewable energy
should not blow up the bill for households and businesses, but
otherwise contribute to its reduction.
The PS will lead his action, as he has always done, paying attention
specific to households with low incomes and resources and giving priority to
the fight against energy poverty.
The regionalization of certain skills following the reform of the State offers
also new tools to Wallonia to act: the transfer of a large
part of the lease law, some aspects of property taxation and
regulation of distribution tariffs. For the PS, this is an opportunity to conduct
housing policies and more efficient energy, social and contact information so
provide each quality housing that consumes less energy.
The energy sector, face all the challenges ahead, also provides
great potential for local job creation and quality development
industrial and technological innovation. The PS will also be attentive to the future
active workers in energy.
The PS also wants an energy landscape works and in which each
actor (suppliers, producers, transporters, distributors, public authorities,
301

regulators) ensures its role effectively and transparently in order to offer
quality service at the best possible price for citizens and businesses.
For this, governments must fulfill their strategic tasks, a
by regulating the entire market and its players, the other playing
an active role in terms of consumer protection, security
supply and network management.
Coordination must also be strengthened between the country's three Regions
and the federal government so that the objectives of each are
consistent. This concerns in particular the control of energy prices and
realization of a long-term energy vision for Belgium, articulated
with the European strategy, which is stable and discussed with all stakeholders
energy.
Finally, the liberalized European market needs to be reviewed from top to bottom. Europe
can not settle for ineffective market and 28 member states
organize their security of supply isolation. The emphasis should be
on the fight against energy poverty, consumer protection,
energy efficiency, price regulation, corporate access to energy,
the development of European infrastructures for production and transport,
reduced environmental impact and improved coordination of
national policies for a real Europe of energy.

1. NSURING THE ALL ACCESS ENERGY
The four axes defends the PS to guarantee universal access to energy are
Price controls for households and SMEs, information and protection
consumers, helping people who have difficulties paying their bills
and the support of citizens and businesses to reduce their consumption
(see point 2).
At European level, the PS proposes to:


define the criteria for energy poverty and implement a
transversal action to eliminate it (declining strategy
Then at federal and regional level);

environmental and dedicated assets) of energy companies that are
transnational and often beyond the national control;



strengthen collaboration, both between mediators between the other
national and European regulators, ensure exchange of best

such as ticket offices or homes of energy:
o which will be accessible to the general public and SMEs;
o who will provide information on access to energy and
advice and work to save energy;
o that directly provide advice and support
personalized, or that links to relevant actors, such as
Loan regional fund to reduce consumption (see point 2), the
CPAS or federal mediator, responsible for all issues
relating to the functioning of the market;
o that will ensure coordination between the different regional actors
jurisdiction to avoid duplication;



improve the work of energy accompanying social services
combining consumer protection, learning management
efficient energy and support the reduction of consumption;



strengthen the work of energy tutors in CPAS (that help reduce
the energy costs of insecure households), coordinated with the fund
Regional loan, which go directly to the meeting of households
insecure, complementing the work of the contact points;



organize or strengthen exchange sessions and training
destination of social workers to protect the best
vulnerable consumers;



help households who heat with kerosene to use other
fuel less harmful to their health, such as stoves or
quality pellet boiler (wood);



assess the prepaid meters of gas and electricity budget to see
if they are the best social protection for the consumer to
reasonable cost to the community and develop alternatives if
required;



complete the installation of individual meters in all homes
to allow each household to control its own consumption;
304



deploy smart meters only selectively
(for certain types of consumers) and segmented (at the
medium voltage) based on a socio-economic assessment, in order not
not burden the consumer invoice and install meters
in cases where they actually allow better manage
consumption, while protecting data privacy.

2. R ED UIRE THE CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY
Reduce energy consumption while maintaining a quality of life
equivalent or even higher is the priority for the PS. Consuming less is
spend less. Consuming less is less polluting. Consume less,
is to reduce our energy dependence vis-à-vis the outside. Consume
less is finally the most effective way to fight against global warming
climate. There are several levers to act either by buildings,
industrial processes, land use (see Chapter Development
territorial) and transport (see Chapter mobility).
At the federal level, the PS proposes to:


strengthen product standards and gradually ban products
less efficient (in particular as regards the boiler,
appliances and lighting) without the prices increase to
promote products that consume little energy and preserve
better health and the environment (see chapter Product Policy);



improve product labeling for the same purpose;



Fedesco amplify the action of the public corporation created to reduce
energy use of federal public buildings, improving
coordination with the Buildings Agency for the management of the park
federal real fully integrates energy objectives;



extend to all areas of rehabilitation and urban revitalization and
rural development schemes as the decrease in VAT of 21
6% on demolition operations / reconstruction of buildings
unhealthy, regardless of the type of operators in order to foster
development of buildings that consume little energy.

At the Walloon level, the PS proposes to:


create a regional public fund which will take over the tasks of the FRCE the
Federal reducing the overall cost of energy funds after
Regionalization:
o

which will be active throughout the Walloon region;

o

which will grant interest-free loans to households, according to
their income to finance saving work
Energy, on the model of the third investment;

o

which lend as owners, co-owners only
tenants of public and private sectors;

o

which will aim in particular households in low and middle income
ensuring, in consultation with the single point of contact and
305

CPAS, specific support (social, technical,
Budgetary) more precarious public so that each Wallon
can reduce its invoice;
o

which will work in coordination with existing players and
integrate other public lending mechanisms;



encourage citizens to invest primarily in the most work
efficient in terms of energy savings before investing in the
renewable generation or other energy efficiency actions
less efficient, strengthening the conditions for granting and
providing adequate information on various loans and
aid;



evaluate all premiums for insulation and those for renovation
homes to see if they can be simplified or merged and
change so that households with low and middle income are
really and primarily assisted in their work for energy savings;



pay particular attention to tenants who must also benefit
efforts to reduce energy consumption, using various
levers of action: for example, CPAS, regional funds or other
regional actors must act in order to promote agreements between
landlords and tenants, and premiums for insulation and renovation
must also be made more accessible to tenants;



launch joint operations to reduce consumption
residential energy (public housing, apartment buildings or
territorial approach "street by street" or neighborhood, for example), with
the support of local actors, who will benefit from funding
specific (taxation, loans, third-party investors, European aid); this
to achieve economies of scale, achieve effects more
significant and strengthen the fight against energy poverty and
social cohesion ;



implement ambitious standards to reduce consumption
building energy while avoiding the social,
urban and negative economic, favoring measures

these progressive standards for the sector to adapt without
create additional costs and distinguishing the requirements for buildings
new, for renovations and old buildings and
heritage;



promote initiatives by social economy enterprises
to perform minor surgery to improve the effectiveness

of the heating control, for example);



continue efforts to reduce energy consumption
buildings and public housing (see Chapters and sustainable development
housing);



improve the efficiency of employment-environment alliance for
sustainable construction - which brings together public authorities and partners
social around a dual objective of creating jobs and improving the
306

energy quality of buildings - and amplify its implementation on the
ground, in consultation with the social partners;


invest in research and innovation in energy efficiency,
including strengthening partnerships between universities, centers
research and businesses.

As for businesses, the PS is particularly attentive to strengthen
energy efficiency to reduce production costs and their
help create more jobs.
For this purpose, the proposed PS:


expand branch agreements (which are a commitment by industries
reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases and consumption
energy in exchange for public support) to other professional sectors
(tertiary sector and SMEs);



putting energy saving counselors available to SMEs and
non-profit sector, as they do not always have the opportunity to engage
full-time staff to take care of the reduction of their
energy consumption ;



encourage companies to hold an energy accounting and Maps
energy of their buildings;



promote circular economy approach, based on the
Walloon program "NEXT", to help businesses reduce their
energy consumption, for example by favoring the joint use
flow of materials and energy between them.

3. G NSURING SAFE AND AVAILABLE ENERGY
The PS wants to ensure security of energy supply at all times.
This requires reducing consumption, plan and develop
adequate production capacity in Europe and Belgium, secure
supply routes from outside and develop
energy transport infrastructures between European countries.
At European level, the PS proposes to:


develop a real energy strategy compared to regions
external to Europe in order to ensure diversity and reliability of our
sources of supply;



strengthen internal coordination between Member States in terms of
security of supply to clear and consistent policy
ensure that the decisions of a State weakens supply
its neighbors;



harmonize European rules production support to avoid
that producers do not competition between states but
otherwise establish a security of solidarity
supply between neighboring countries;

307



promote European investment in energy infrastructure
(production, networks and interconnections of offshore wind farms) to
reduce costs for consumers;



supporting interconnection projects between European countries and between
Europe and its neighbors.

At the federal level, the PS proposes to:


ensure nuclear exit, on schedule, by developing
adequate alternatives in order not to undermine our
electricity supply;



continue the development of renewable energy taking
account of a realistic development potential, cost and
social and economic benefits associated;



rebalance the access of energy networks to prevent
efficient gas power plants are closed as they remain
essential for our supply and to avoid job losses;



develop research in the storage of energy, including
developing electric vehicles which can be used to store
electricity during the night;



stimulate electricity demand management mechanisms
reduce the consumption peaks (that is to say
encourage large consumers to reduce their consumption
electricity during periods of high demand);



facilitate administrative
production capacity;



expand the possibilities of the network operator

provisions to be adequate and available to be released
in good time and avoid these costs refer to the community
(present and future);



promote nuclear medicine research for which Belgium
has an expertise recognized internationally.

4. DEVELOP RENEWABLE ENERGY SAVE IES
The development of renewable energies should continue to
strengthen our energy independence at the European and Belgian level, of
reduce our emissions and greenhouse gas, responsible
global warming and to achieve our international climate goals.
The impact in terms of creating local jobs and quality must be
also amplified.
For the PS, this necessary development can not continue that into
account realistic development potential of renewable energy
our territory and their advantages and disadvantages in terms
environmental, social and economic. The deployment pace is
also be reflected to avoid the additional costs and other difficulties that could
lead to a massive rejection of renewable energy by the population.
The PS also wants to ensure the proper integration of renewable energies
in the energy system. Given their maturity, they should be treated on a
par compared to other energy sources. This concerns both
network access, balancing supply and demand as support
public. On this last point, it is essential that renewable boom
should not complicate excessively the bill for households and businesses. The PS
holds also focus public aid on development
community infrastructure so that renewable energies can benefit
to all.
At all levels of power, the PS proposes to:


invest in research and innovation to make energy
competitive renewable;



Renewable control support costs in order to limit the impact
on the bill of consumers, especially the most citizens
fragile, in particular by providing reasonable annual budgets to do
not exceed ;



natural waste for example).

Wallonia particular, the PS proposes to:


promote production tools and centralized renewable energy
continuously operating to generate cost savings in terms of
operating costs and adaptive networks;



regulate the installation of wind turbines in order to help
Renewable development without compromising the health and
quality of life of local residents;



promote investment of local governments and residents
in wind farms so that wind turbines benefit all;



study the possibilities offered by the small wind by developing
pilot projects and assess whether it provides a socio-economic interest,
environmental and technical complement the large wind;



encourage energy recovery from residual waste, the
quality cogeneration and the promotion of solar panels



support collective heating networks, including powered by

distribution and public transportation. Indeed, network managers
electricity transmission and natural gas are companies where there is strong
public ownership and management of electricity distribution networks and
of natural gas are wholly or largely controlled by the municipalities.

310

That is why the proposed PS:


ensure strong public regulation at all levels;



determine public policy for the future and the mission of Elia
Fluxys and to ensure effective capacity of Belgian public action
in an area that becomes increasingly European;



keep distribution system operators controlled by
who develop a common vision of the collective interest;



ensure quality distribution at the best price possible and to ensure the
coherence between public obligations, technical rules and
the impact on the price of gas and electricity;



gradually provide distribution tariffs harmonized for all
Walloons;



strengthen intra-Belgian coordination mechanisms (federal state,
Regions, municipalities) and between European countries;



SOCIAL COHESION
A company can not entertain satisfactory and sustainable development if
it is built on a strong solidarity between citizens. Social cohesion
is the set of processes that help to ensure effective access to all
basic rights and economic well-being, social and cultural order
allow everyone to actively participate in society and to be recognized.
For the PS, an inclusive society should enable everyone to take part in the life
social, political, economic, cultural. An inclusive society does not attend the
individuals, but puts them in capacity by emancipation and social policy
bringing health to each according to his needs, tools and support.
Every citizen must have the certainty that the vagaries of life that result
sometimes a loss of professional income and a decrease in the level of
life will not lead to the isolation or exclusion.
The ideal of social justice that animates the PS leads him to claim that the entire
the company is concerned about the fate of citizens who face temporarily
or permanently in such difficulties that they find themselves having to ask
assistance to achieve lead a life with human dignity.
Each precarious person who finds only contempt and disapproval on her
course, could still put out a little more than a shed freely. It's in
defending the right of everyone to lead a life consistent with human dignity
rather than between those active economically to those
seeking help, a company rises.
Beyond the speeches, clichés and amalgams, PS defends a system
where the authorities provide all citizens face a situation of
decommissioning, support for social well-being that allows
out of poverty and reintegration.
For the PS, it is imperative to recognize that the social welfare system carried
on the ground by the CPAS particular, fulfills the ideal of social justice and
fight against precariousness. We must tackle this fight together
precariousness and defend the right of all to live in dignity.

AGAINST THE UTTER pauv RETE

In Belgium, a citizen seven lives below the poverty line. This digit
even reached one in five for the elderly and for children. If the
Poverty is often marked by insufficient income, it is not just
to a simple lack of money. In reality, it affects all aspects of life
our poorest citizens. By their insecurity, they see their access
fundamental rights and basic needs such as health care,
housing, employment, education and strongly hampered culture.
Poverty is discriminatory determinant of health: hope

Different categories of the population have a higher risk of poverty:
single parents, people with low level of training,
unemployed, on disability and disabled, children, people
elderly and foreigners or persons of foreign origin.
Our welfare system plays a vital role in avoiding a
even higher proportion falling into extreme poverty.
If the fight against poverty is a transversal policy against the
income inequality, housing, employment and education, social services
and health play a leverage role in the fight against poverty and
wellness promotion particularly through the provision of universal services and
positive discrimination measures in favor of more precarious.
In the longer term, a policy to fight against poverty is part
of justice and solidarity plays on the sense of justice and security
allowing everyone to take initiatives, to emancipate, to invest and
to participate fully in the life of society.
For the PS, it should lead up an integrated action policy
social and health services, accessible to all, contributing to the empowerment, autonomy
and well-being of persons, motor for social and economic development.
Then it is a "win-win" approach ensuring social cohesion.
Over-indebtedness is a phenomenon that affects a lot of Belgians
precarious situation. It concerns the people living in over-consumption
but especially low-income people who do not have the means to
face unforeseeable expenditure (health problems, school fees,
increased cost of energy). Many people are over-indebted
use of easy credit to meet their primary expenditure or
acquire basic necessities. Despite legislative advances
significant in terms of consumer credit, much work remains
to do with families and young people against the use of credits
and consumer credit cards offered by large retailers who
manage to bypass the legal framework.
The relocation policy homeless and badly housed people must
become a policy priority. It should appear as a new mode
rehabilitation, an alternative to what already exists.
The top priority of all levels of government is to enable everyone to
lead a life with human dignity. Every citizen must be able
have an income which can not be below the poverty line, a
housing at reasonable prices, access to health care, access to
energy, education and culture. The gradual increase in allocations
social (integration income, equivalent welfare, Grapa, pension,
handicap or disability allowance) to reach the poverty line, is a
priority.

313

Regarding the risk of poverty, the PS proposes to:


increase by 2% per year all minimum social (income
Integration, equivalent welfare, Grapa, pension, allowance
handicap or disability) to a total increase in these
minimums of 10% over the next five years (link welfare
included);



ensure the proper implementation of the law which provides for the automatic connection of the
welfare social benefits;



continue the process of individualisation of social rights
would no longer link the amount of allowances to choose life
the person and encourage practical solutions that
shared housing-related costs such as co-location, habitat
solidarity or solidarity between cohabiting persons, without this
systematically lead to a financial penalty and reduced
social benefits;



examine the possibility of reviewing the income related categories
integration (single, cohabiting person and family responsibilities) to
adapt best to the household composition, the way of life
citizens and the cost of housing in particular;



reinforce the fight against precariousness improving
operation of social relays including the mechanism
award grants to members to relay operators;



establish a comprehensive policy on food and unsold
fight against waste, and enjoy the new legal framework introduced by the
PS to develop collaborations with large surfaces
across the widest possible territory (regional or
Federal) so that they distribute their unsold food to more
nots, in collaboration with social actors;



promote the creation and development of social shopping by
CPAS or partners (associations, cooperatives) to
guarantee access to consumer goods and services for
people on low incomes;



maintain food aid at a sufficiently high level
emphasizing quality food, structuring donations,
transport and distribution of food aid and creating particular
specific social economy enterprises providers of employment;



ensure citizens literacy through optimization of
existing initiatives (including synergies from the integration of
immigrants, social cohesion plans and training in languages
part of the job search), the adoption of a regulation laying
objective criteria for granting funding, better management
account the target audience and territorial coordination within the
School basins;



continue the fight against excessive debt including by framing the
easy credit, by strengthening controls in the field, supporting
Mediation service existing debts, informing the public, and
314

youth in particular, on these services as a preventive measure
debt and not only as the last resort, and
promoting budgetary guidance;


continue the fight against the digital divide so that citizens
more precarious are not denied access to the multimedia world
do not suffer discrimination based on their income.

Regarding child poverty, family poverty
parent and poverty of the elderly, the PS proposes to:


develop a specific axis fight against infant and precariousness
youth policies such as youth welfare, health or
education;



organize education that ensures social advancement of everyone in
acting in particular on the reduction of school fees, creation
central purchasing and mid differentiated framework policies
School (see also Chapter Education);



increase the minimum pension for a single person to 1,300 euros
month (for a full career) by the end of the next Parliament,
regardless of the regime (salaried, independent, official career
mixed), and bring to 1,150 euros per month the income guarantee for
Elderly (Grapa), enjoyed by people who do not have
right to adequate pension, for example because they have not
worked enough years, and who do not have other
financial resources (see also Chapter Pensions);



to lead the reform of conditions of access to SECAL (fund
maintenance claims which may benefit people on low
income in order to receive an advance on maintenance payments due,
the fund undertaking to recover these sums directly from the
defaulter) by raising the income ceiling which can have
the person submitting a request for assistance and removing the ceiling
Granted advances.

Regarding access to healthcare, the PS offers (see also Chapter
Health):


ensure access to health care regardless of financial status,
including educating physicians in the practice of medicine
social proximity PMS center or in the CPAS, strengthening the
financing of primary care medical home and
the use of comprehensive medical record or automating the mechanism
third-party payment for insecure patients;



Social automate third-party payment for the patients and precarious
chronic patients no longer have to advance money for their care
health, through the development of secure data exchange network
between mutuals and caregivers "My CareNet"
(electronic transmission of billing documents, documents
administrative or certificates, etc.).

315

With regard to the housing and the cost of energy, the PS proposed (see
Also chapters Housing and Energy):


ensure that all towns are able to offer a
adequate supply of public housing to citizens who have
precarious income;



fight the "employment traps" in public housing and to allow
a prospective tenant who found a job to keep in his
application for a dwelling, the benefits of its location
Previous social and professional;



grant more importance to single-parent families and
homeless people in the provision of social housing like this
is practiced in the context of social emergencies;



develop services to IDESS (Employment Development Initiatives
in the local services sector Professional insertion) CPAS
accessible to people living in poverty and enable them
performing at a reduced and affordable for small repair work
in housing, gardening, social or taxis
yet social stores;



take concrete action to reduce charges related to energy prices,
especially in regulating energy prices, promoting purchases
bundled energy, pursuing social individual accompaniment
specifically in energy, disseminating information and tools
practices to the public on the choice of suppliers, the
understanding invoices and general information on
supply of gas and electricity and energy saving practices;



maintain social gas and electricity prices and the aid of
Oil minimum funding at current levels;



harmonize and improve the management of federal energy funds so that,
in the interests of beneficiaries, support differs by the CPAS
not according to the energy source used by the recipient (gas,
electricity, oil);


extend the automatic granting of social tariffs (that is to say without granting
request) that already exists for the supply of electricity and
Gas other sectors (transport, telecom, ...) so that
each recipient can obtain the benefits to which he is entitled.

Regarding access to culture, sport and leisure, the PS offers
of:


develop social activation economically vulnerable to public
notably through participation in sports or
cultural;



maintain and develop policies reduced rates to public
with limited financial resources (including free access
museums recognized on the first Sunday of the month, supporting
specialized associations like Arsene Article 27 or 50);
316



develop cultural mediation to initiate the most citizens
precarious culture and get them out of their isolation;



develop cross-sectoral partnerships and consultations for
concerted policy against poverty particularly in connection with
the youth welfare, health and mental health and education.

Regarding the "homelessness" and the poorly housed, PS
proposes:

2.



guide the policy of "homelessness" to a policy
priority rehousing ("housing first") and, in this sense, support
existing pilot projects and after evaluation, to extend the offer;



structurally support night shelters by guaranteeing so
regulatory and sustainable funding for these structures;



conduct a broad reflection on the care of the homeless
particularly by winter plan to ensure better use
budgets that are spent there as part of an overall policy
relocation and support for homeless (also
in the post-resettlement monitoring) and ensure developing
adequate measures to the public consists of undocumented migrants.

A CCOMPAGNER THE KIDNEY insertion

The PS believes that the best tools to fight against insecurity are
insertion into society, quality support and acquisition
skills.
Some citizens have an almost non-existent career. Other
are downgraded after the loss of a job. Initiatives must be taken to
actually allow people who are unemployed and
submit an application to the CPAS to recover in a situation where
they can assert their acquired skills or to acquire, on
the labor market.
Projects must be initiated for the people greatly distanced Market
work because living on the streets or because of a significant marginalization
out of wandering and reintegrate.
Finally, special attention must be paid to the many young people who
never worked, who are destitute and who turn to the CPAS
in the absence of other replacement income.
PS proposes to:


continue and better support through the insertion
sociovocational by "Articles 60 and 61," a policy based on
solidarity jobs that are mainly used in the service sectors
of the population (the public sector, the non-profit, helping people
and the social economy), especially through the IDESS Services
CPAS supporting integration through work experience and
317

develop the supply of local services at an affordable cost (see
also Chapter employment);

3.



improve exchanges and relations between Forem and CPAS order
optimize the passage through the employment contract for specific insertion
Beneficiaries of the integration income (Article 60 for non sector
merchant and Article 61 for the market sector) in the path towards
employment;



particularly support the conclusion of individual projects
social integration for young people receiving social assistance
with specific guidance for those who have never inserted
the labor market;



develop pathways rewarding professional experience of public
targets while supporting training and recovery study;



remobilization of political support, social inclusion to
of the most vulnerable and inactive people in public since
many years, developed by network programs with
associations mobilizing the resources of the user by learning
the French, the practice of culture, including the group workshops
citizenship, self-image, culture and sport;



promote entrepreneurial development of income recipients
integration (RI) by allowing them to keep the RI during a
limited period after the launch of their activity, for a
support similar to that provided by the structures
Accompanying the self-creation of employment;



authorized under a pilot project beneficiaries to realize RI
deliberately odd jobs (eg maintenance work)
for utilities (apart from a contracting by Article
60 imposing regularity and sustainability in which certain
People are not able to register), enabling them to
earning a financial supplement to their RI but especially to gain
experience and a useful monitoring for a rehabilitation through labor;



promote the creation of social economy sectors in areas
of undeveloped activities (urban renewal, maintenance spaces
Public and cemeteries).

R TRENGTHENING CPAS

Everyone has the right to social assistance. It aims to enable everyone
to lead a life consistent with human dignity. The first article of the law
Organic CPAS (Law of July 8, 1976) entrusts this mission CPAS
important to the population.
Local public service, the CPAS is the last safety net and
fight against social exclusion. To fulfill its missions, the CPAS occupies in
the communal area a special place. The CPAS is a genuine public service
communal, enjoying a real legal and functional autonomy.
The increase in phenomena of social exclusion place at the heart of CPAS
local social policies. To conduct these social policies, must CPAS
318

be strengthened so that their mission to help the poorest can be
continued.
PS is particularly committed to the defense of public service guarantees
the granting of social assistance, the development of innovative tools for
accompaniment and prevention of poverty. Meanwhile,
PS also recognizes the existence of a rich voluntary sector and quality
also responds to social issues. It is in this context that the role of
social coordination played by the CPAS is decisive.
The voluntary sector organizes access to outpatient services,
literacy, social cohesion, quality of socio-professional insertion.
The registered sector is to fulfill a general interest mission delegate.
As such, it is a partner in the implementation of public policies. He is
necessary to ensure a real partnership in communes and
neighborhood associations between themselves and with the CPAS.
Social action CPAS must be "waste". It is essential that the
upstream policies do not create poverty but rather
distribute wealth more fairly and labor that produces them. Rather
to conduct downstream policies of aid to people who have switched to the
poverty or who have always known the weight, it must pursue policies of
effective prevention.
It is imperative to break down barriers between powers exercised between various levels
power because of the social difficulties encountered by the public are insecure
multifactorial and accompanying material cutting and integration
Social is in this context, against-productive.
The CPAS expenses are constantly rising given the period of crisis
We cross. In an economically difficult time, the CPAS are
called to face enormous challenges.
CPAS in terms of funding, the PS proposes to:


ensure budget neutrality for CPAS measures adopted by
all levels of power, especially by counteracting the effect of
federal decisions partly or wholly supported by these
last;



examine the possibility of increasing federal intervention in the
repayment of RI as well as medical aid application fees in
For the sake of solidarity and fair redistribution;



pay particular attention to the CPAS facing cities
proportionally to further expand the consequences of the crisis;



pursue the unification of systems of aids granted by the CPAS and
aim for a merger of RI and equivalent welfare.

Regarding social work CPAS, the PS proposes to:


revalue the social work profession CPAS, including through
319

increased support for continuing training (required for the proper
fulfillment of their missions guidance) and supervision
(psychological support necessary for the proper management of stress,
some forms of violence);

4.



strive for maximum working standard by social worker in
CPAS;



equip CPAS to simplify everyday work (billing
Electronic, paperless documentation, tools development
IT common to CPAS);



improve partnerships between the CPAS, real estate agencies
social (AIS), housing companies and municipalities to help
people in precarious situations to find accommodation in the private;



continue the reform of medical aid recipients of aid
Social dependent CPAS initiated by the Federal Government and to
the computerization of the management of medical records, so that the
Software developed to be used by all care providers
(hospitals, doctors, nurses, etc.) and the Auxiliary Fund

electronics such costs;



strengthen coordination and synergies between CPAS to promote

Access to housing and the right to lead a life consistent with human dignity
are fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. With a shortage of
housing but also the cost of housing, many families have chosen
settling permanently in tourist areas. The habitat
Standing in leisure area covers at least 10,000 people in Wallonia.
If, for some it is a life choice, for many people,
settle in recreational area - mostly in insecure housing and
remote services - proves a default choice.
Since 2003, the Walloon Government is implementing a plan "Habitat
permanent "(HP) plan was updated in 2011 through 67 measures.
The main objective of the Permanent Habitat Plan is to accompany people
social distress who live permanently in a camping or
residential park or on land that is not intended for hosting
residents.
The ambition of the HP plan is to restore the fundamental rights of individuals,
to improve their situation and their quality of life and prevent exploitation
insecurity.
321

The permanent habitat is a variety of situations, be they
people of habitat types or camping sites and parks
residential.
In this context, the PS proposes to:



continue the implementation of the Plan and HP offer people
precarious situation and who wish relocation outside
tourist-oriented facilities with an accompanying
quality and adequate aid;



increase the number upstream of decent housing at affordable prices
particularly in rural communities (see housing program);



develop alternative housing adapted to expectations

O RGANISER THE HOME OF TRAVELLERS

Under the generic term "travelers" are grouped populations
of different origins: Roma, Manush, Gypsies, whose itinerant lifestyle
is essentially the mobile habitat.
The "travelers" regularly stay in Wallonia for periods
varying from a few days to several weeks. The number of people
in this group and from Belgium fluctuates between 15,000 and 20,000
for the three Regions of the country. To these figures are added several
Hundreds of families (about 3000-5000 people) crossing the country
during the right season, from neighboring countries, particularly France
and the Netherlands.
The option taken in Wallonia since 2004 is to focus on building
agreed solutions as part of a process conducted with all
stakeholders: local authorities, Mediation Center of the people
Travel and Roma in Wallonia, family representatives of Travellers,
relevant associations, local residents, other public authorities ... This approach
takes time, but the results are much more satisfying and sustainable. This
method also allows, in a progressive manner, and better than all
Speech to bring each other to live together.
PS proposes to:


strengthen support for the people of the Mediation Center Travel
Wallonia;
322



finalizing an inventory of land available for hosting major
groups;



EQUALITY
The equality of the citizens is at the heart of the social project of the PS.
For the PS, racism, anti-Semitism, all forms of incitement to hatred and
discrimination must be fought and eliminated and prosecuted vigorously. The pattern
rejection and discrimination is based on gender, origin, nationality,
sexual orientation, gender identity, health status, beliefs
philosophical or religious beliefs, disability, etc.
Equality of rights, it is already a first step. In addition, it is also necessary
the citizens know their rights and can assert them. A
State proactive in the fight against racism and discrimination prompting
citizens to invoke the guarantees of the legislative arsenal is
PS one wants to build.
For equality policies or the fight against discrimination are
fully effective, they must be integrated into other policies
social. That is why other parts of the program (employment,
persons with disabilities ...) also deal directly or
indirectly of equality and the fight against discrimination.

If this equality is not reflected in practice. We must therefore continue
work to achieve true equality.

3.1.

STRENGTHENING THE FIGHT AGAINST RACISM AND DISCRIMINATION

At the initiative of the PS, many texts prohibit and punish racism and
discrimination. For PS, a democratic society can not tolerate any

SCHOOL MAKE A PLACE OF LIVING TOGETHER OF PROMOTION

Many studies still show very unequal nature of our

In a democratic society which respects each person must

discrimination or limitation to the enjoyment of their rights.
To fight against transphobia and homophobia, the PS proposes to:


ensure the implementation of the extension of anti-discrimination legislation to identity, gender and gender expression;



effectively implement the policy of identification and
Registration homophobic assaults and
transmission to the public prosecutor and develop, on the basis of statistics
obtained adequate prevention policies;



support studies and research to obtain data

the lesbian police associations and networks (ne) s, gay, bisexual (le) s,
transgender, queer, questionning, intersex (LGBTQQI);



develop projects in countries where homosexuality is penalized,
repressed and / or stigmatized, to support initiatives aimed at
decriminalize homosexuality and fight homophobia.

In teaching and education, the PS proposes to:


include a gender dimension, including equality for
homosexuals and transsexuals in the initial and continuing training
teachers;



encourage the use of neutral textbooks in terms of sexuality;



make a new cadastre of EVRAS animations (education for life
relational, emotional and sexual) to evaluate existing systems
and to generalize them.

In adoption and kinship, the PS proposes to:


plan and organize social relationship status to recognize
socially and legally protect the links between a
person who is not the child's biological parent and the latter;



facilitate the establishment of the filiation of couples of the same sex in respect
the child of their joint project, by assimilating couples

conduct information and awareness campaigns to
promote gender LGBTQQI;



sport ;

335



provide structural and sustainable support to LGBTQQI associations,
including through reconnaissance.

People who feel the intimate conviction of belonging to another genre
as that assigned to them in their birth face
a stigma in our democratic society. Despite some advances
laudable, the law of 10 May 2007 on transsexuality itself creates a
part stigmatizing for those affected. In fact, the law provides
currently stigmatizing certain conditions under which persons
who wish to change name or gender must register such as
compulsory sterilization or also mandatory psychiatric treatment.
More than five years after its adoption and given the latest studies
performed, the PS proposes to revise the law of May 10, 2007 so that all constraints
linked to the sterilization or the use of hormones is strictly prohibited.
Specifically, the PS proposes to:


review the legal criteria that the applicant must meet before
to change name or gender;



loose the ability to change civil status of any sex reassignment
within the meaning of the Act of 10 May 2007;



examine the possibility of reformulating the law of 10 May 2007 so that the
reproductive rights of transgender people or intersex is not

ASYLUM AND IMMIGRATION
The important reforms introduced in the field of nationality,
family reunification and transposition of European regulations have
made some turnovers in the procedures.
The PS has at heart to ensure that these reforms the death knell changes
legislative sometimes adopted too hastily and not taking
sufficient account of the reality behind the clichés on immigration.
The PS wants it made some legislative changes to
correct the perverse effects of the reforms adopted. The PS also insists that
now correspond only to obligations created rights for
immigrants.

B UILDING THE INTEGRATION OF O PRIM - ARRIVALS IN
THE CONTEXT OF A JOURNEY HOME

The PS defends intercultural model as new integration mode
arrivals. This model advocates harmonious relations between cultures, based on
intensive trade, and focused on a mode of integration that does not seek to abolish
differences.
The integration of foreigners beyond the issue of integration
professional. A harmonious integration of newcomers to the
society, their ability to develop a sense of belonging and acting
as full citizens are closely linked to social inclusion
whose employment is only one element, albeit an important one. At that social inclusion
also involved the quality of reception, integration in a living environment,
access to adequate housing, adequate socio-emotional environment. These
various dimensions of the social integration of migrants call
development policies and programs in various sectors,
synergistically contribute to social integration of newcomers.
The integration of newcomers is a dynamic two-way process
mutual acceptance, based on reciprocity of rights and duties,
involving both immigrants and their descendants in the host society
whole.
As part of the host course for newcomers, the PS proposes to:


operationalize and strengthen existing initiatives from the
Main courses of newcomers set up in Wallonia;



P rotect MIGRANT CHILDREN AGE

A minor can not be held responsible for the irregularity of his situation
administrative or that of his parents. Numerous studies have established the
disastrous consequences of a closed detention center for minors
especially on young children. If the practice of detention of children
experienced favorable developments in Belgium in recent years,
principle of the formal prohibition of detention of unaccompanied minors
or family must be registered in the Belgian legislation.
An unaccompanied minor must, as a major, you can submit the examination
its protection application to the competent asylum authorities simultaneously
it has a temporary residence permit, limited to its majority. A
choice should not be made asylum and residence.
Finally, the distinction, the protection point of view, between miners not
together European and non-European unaccompanied minors is
not justified. It should take into account the vulnerability of any minor non
accompanied, whatever his nationality.
In this logic, the PS proposes to:


Sign in Belgian law, the obligation to take into account
the best interests of the child and motivate decisions about a
Minor specifically on that basis;

change the definition of unaccompanied foreign minors in
legislation for the guardianship order that unaccompanied minors

E NCADRER DETENTIO THE N OF FOREIGNERS

INTERNATIONAL

Although knowing certain analogies with preventive detention,
detention of foreigners do not enjoy the same procedural guarantees such
that systematic judicial review of the deprivation of liberty. Numbers
Available on the matter indeed demonstrate that only a decision
foreign administrative detention in five is subject to the review of the
council chamber.
The Aliens Office has the possibility of bringing an appeal against
the decision on administrative detention, issued by the Chamber of
indictments. This possibility does not exist in the head of parquet
for preventive detention. We must end this distinction.
The European Court of Human Rights condemned Belgium for several
times to the detention of foreigners or minors in closed centers,
Whereas it was inhuman and degrading treatment. Since then,
unaccompanied minors hardly longer under detention but
minors with family however are not spared. Similarly,
asylum seekers who present themselves at the border are systematically

CULTURE
The financial crisis of 2008 and the major impact it caused on
public finances have led many European countries to reduce
considerably the resources allocated to culture. The Federation WallonieBruxelles (FWB), it has not chosen this way: budget allocations
cultural disciplines have been preserved and even, for some of them,
increased. The current situation is not idyllic however, and the work must
be continued.
Several major issues can be identified for the coming years:
 access to culture in the light of technological developments
changing modes of access and cultural consumption, or even
cultural production;
 cultural diversity all the more essential in the digital age and
the proliferation of media (tablets, smartphones, ...);
 territorial cultural development to integrate in an area
specific geographical (cultural area), supply operators
next cultural needs, aspirations or desires of the public who
live in that territory;
 the economic impact of the cultural field in terms of jobs (direct or
indirect), value creation, welfare of the population.
These issues naturally necessary to understand the cultural policy under
the angle of cultural functions. Indeed, each of the identified challenges must
translate, in each artistic discipline or socio-cultural field, by
measures affecting public education and citizen participation, creation
and artistic production, dissemination and promotion of works, the
conservation and promotion of heritage. The design of a policy
coherent and comprehensive cultural led to appoint three priorities are

 preserve the heritage and ensure its recovery;
 rethink cultural governance;
 structure the cultural and creative industries field;
 optimize the financing of culture.

S USCITER CREATION

Be creative today is not easy: the economic conditions
reinforce in many ways often inherent precariousness creation. The
institutions to initiate or encourage the creation are themselves
subject to high pressure. Also, government actions and support
are paramount, especially as the cultural and creative disciplines present
potential for economic growth and significant job creation.
For the PS should therefore on the one hand, to support the creation by setting
place of public support (institutional and financial) and, secondly,
encourage and mentor alternative culture funding practices.
2.1.

SUPPORT EMPLOYMENT IN THE CULTURAL SECTOR

Employment in the arts requires specific attention. Guarantee
artistic and secure employment is, in the eyes of the PS, a priority. The precariousness night
the serenity necessary for creative work; it prevents too often
artists grasp the future with confidence. It is therefore essential to realize
a policy of artistic work.
To achieve this objective, the PS proposes to:


help the creator to express his talent in optimum conditions.
As regards information, the PS proposes to:


ensure the effective implementation of the wicket and arts
development of its activities in terms of any artist or orientation

(premises, equipment, legal assistance, help in finding supports
financial);

continue the renewal of equipment Nannine loan facility.

The copyright and related rights account for creators
essential resources that allow them to continue their creative work.
With this in mind, the PS proposes to:

A CCOMPAGNER DIFFUS THE ION AND N OF PROMOTIO
CULTURE

The aim of cultural policy is achieved if the works and artists
who made them have a mailing enabling them to enter
contact with the public. To win this bet, you should act concomitantly
on multiple channels: the creation and development of venues,
organizing promotional events sectors, supporting structures
active in the distribution, etc.
358

3.1.

CREATING AND DEVELOPING THE DISTRIBUTION PLACES

We know how it is necessary, both in Wallonia and Brussels to promote
dissemination of works created by our artists. Some disciplines have
broadcast networks already in theaters (eg art cinemas and testing or
Plasma network specializing in rock music) or festivals (eg
Current music or film festivals).
To stimulate the dissemination, particularly within other disciplines, PS
proposes:


encourage the creation of specific broadcast networks, promotion
and awareness of artistic disciplines (visual arts and arts
contemporary, choreography, drama, fairground arts,
circus and street, classical music, contemporary music, storytelling,
etc.) taking into account the lessons of the Assizes
Territorial cultural development;

joint development operations.

3.2.

COMMUNICATING BY PUBLIC WORKS

Develop distribution networks is not enough. It is also necessary that these places

To do this, the proposed PS:


ensure a place for the dissemination of local initiatives in the
programming of cultural centers (amateur theater, bands,
musical groups, academies projects, etc.);



develop common Internet portals with cultural sectors or
strengthen existing initiatives such as the www.numériques.be
to increase the visibility of initiatives and accomplishments of actors
FWB in the cultural and audiovisual material and maximize their

Notice of instances), and by increasing access to artists enjoying a
professional experience and artistic recognition;



promote publications produced in the education field
permanent, including through the provision of citizens
an internet platform is constantly updated.

3.3.

PROMOTING THE LINKS BETWEEN THE CREATION AND DISSEMINATION

Better dissemination of our artists also assumes that
professionals such as programmers or artistic directors, can
know the existence and quality of the creations of our artists.
PS proposes to:


organized by artistic discipline, professional meetings
pursuing the objective of creating networking among programmers, of
coordinate the timing of various events (including
festivals), to improve visibility and to establish a policy
Incentive common tariff for the attention of young people and public

TRENGTHENING ruled NCE THE CULTURE

The concern for adequate governance in the cultural field fed many
of actions implemented in recent years. The objectives of
transparency, objectivity, cooperation of cultural operators have guided
the choices made by the Government. This strong focus needs to be continued.
5.1.

PURSUIT OF THE OBJECTIVES AND TRANSPARENCY REFLECTIVE

In recent years, cultural governance has been greatly increased:

5.4.

WRITE A CODE OF CULTURAL CONTENTS

The FWB is developing a wide range of policies in the cultural sectors.
Many legal and regulatory arrangements have been put in place over
time to organize support for operators and cultural projects
artistic.

MEDIA
The media world is in constant upheaval. The digital revolution
media and technology requires regular adaptations. There
"Technological convergence", the "all digital", the size of the screen
are to meet, sometimes brutally, media actors from
different backgrounds and different trades. This generates
new opportunities but also tension and transformations of
media sphere that can affect the quality and pluralism of information,
cultural diversity and sustainability of local actors.
This situation involves a significant risk of depleting resources and
the energies of the protagonists in conflicts repeatedly, even
arrive for major international companies likely to take
a decisive part of the value and audience. And at the expense of our
local actors who provide quality information and culturally
anchored. Besides these factors, the media are not spared by the crisis
Economic: advertising revenue, those derived from subscription fees and
Payment in traditional media are becoming more uncertain.
In addition, the success of social networks changes the modes of production and
dissemination of information: the role of social bond that the media play against
the public is affected. Information not only travels by
traditional media, but now takes the path of social networks
with certain consequences on the quality and verification of information
transmitted (rumor, unverified information, no ethics standards
always respected ...).
Furthermore, the digital media affects the entire die: multiplication and
dematerialization of content, end of specialty networks and terminals
by content types, multiplication of screens ... The radio is found on the
web, the web is found in television ... It is now time media
360.
Budgetary difficulties, conflicts between local, new arrival
major national operators, technological convergence, the role of erosion
Social media links and personalization of information ... To meet all
these new challenges, the PS proposes to defend the following priorities:
 meet the sector to maintain economic changes
quality, plurality of information and cultural diversity;
 encourage and develop new partnerships and new
initiatives;
 promote our local stakeholders and cultural diversity;
 support professionals facing the digital revolution;
 help citizens face new consumption patterns

Given the evolution of the sector, the government will include

The needs of families in health or parenting support are
constantly changing.
The growing insecurity following the crisis
Economic, combined with the demographic boom in some areas of
Wallonia-Brussels Federation (FWB) have increased in recent years
inequalities and support needs and social monitoring.
Governments must propose solutions that enshrine the rights,
welfare and equality of all children, who tend towards equity between
Parents and facilitate the lives of women and men to reconcile life

It is also essential to respond to situations of insecurity and
impoverishment of families. In addition, distress or

STRENGTHENING THE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF CHILD ABUSE

Child maltreatment is a significant social problem which
demands of the community attention. Prevention and taking
charge of child abuse are handled especially by the teams' SOS
Children. " However, it is essential that all professionals working with children
be sensitive screening situations of abuse, whether
physical or psychological. Indeed, the consequences of this abuse are
severely damaging to the child as immediate as for its

387

HELP YOUTH
The crisis brunt affects the most vulnerable populations. It is up to
governments to develop policies to reduce inequalities
social, educational and economic. The aid sector and the protection of
youth, like that of the general welfare, is both the receptacle
these inequalities and a special lever to counter them.
For the PS, every child, every young person should have equal chances
emancipation. That is why respect for children's rights must be the standard
of all policies affecting children and young people. The PS will defend the
following principles:
 prioritize prevention;
 maintaining, as far as possible, children in their home environment;
according to the International Convention on Children's Rights;
 support to parents or people who educate the child;
 priority to social and educational approach (diversion);
 the right to live according to the dignity here and now and to have
actual future prospects;
 equal access to services provided by the youth assistance (the right
using specialized).
The PS attaches particular importance to the quality of interventions to
children in trouble and in danger and juvenile offenders. This is why
Socialists insist on the adequacy and precocity of these interventions.
To achieve this ambition, the PS proposes to defend the priorities
following:
 support the prevention and address the causes of social exclusion;
 ensure adequate and timely support to young people at risk and children
abused;
 provide educational support to each young offender;
 develop synergies and joints between all sectors
serving children and youth.

E NSURING HELP ADE QUAT E AND QUICK TO YOUTH
DANGER AND S E NFANT abused

PS For every abused child, every young person in danger or in difficulty
serious, must have access to appropriate specialist assistance. We must therefore ensure
that the services offered are available and fairly identically
provided to young people. But today it is clear that inequalities
remain in the equipment of different districts.
The PS proposes to mobilize the youth welfare sector around this
objective of equity, quality and efficiency by redeploying the supply of services to
benefit of all young people in danger and in difficulty, according to criteria
programming objectified.

389

This evolution of service delivery will be based on the following priorities:


equitable distribution of authorized service assistance with Youth
the whole territory;



establish criteria based programming including the number
young by arrondissement, a socio-economic index and an index
accessibility;



improve the licensed sector service offers assistance to youth
limiting the specialization of services and the number of categories
services;



provide priority care for abused children and
risk youth, those who are facing problems
complex and the most vulnerable groups to prevent these minors
threatening not easily find accommodation facilities;



drastically simplify the administrative requirements and procedures
Chartered Accountants services sector (methods for calculating the
subsidies for fixed staff costs, integration grants
for non merchant agreements in Grants,
...) And then stabilize to ensure legal certainty.

The PS also proposes to reorganize the public sector to help
Youth (SAJ and Judicial Protection Service (SPJ)) by the measures
following:

3.



optimize the management of the SAJ and SPJ by appointing a police chief
by reformed judicial district (7 judicial districts in
instead of 13), among the existing advisers and managers;



ensure a balanced workload, like what is done in
hospitals, among all advisers and managers of aid
youth, and their agents (social workers, administrative staff) in
setting workload standards;



support constituents in their search for a quick fix and
suitable for abused children and young people at risk by assigning
SAJ each and every SPJ a number of places reserved in the
Chartered services to enable them to effectively manage
existing institutional resources.

A NSURING AN EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT A C HAQUE
Young offender

Following the latest reform of the state, several new skills will
now exercised by the Federation Wallonia-Brussels, including
measures for the protection of youth, in particular the
identification of measures against youth who have committed or are
suspected of having committed an act qualified as an offense. The PS takes this
opportunity to reaffirm its determination to defend a vision of protection
youth and education restorative.

390

For the PS, the possibilities of supported must be diversified in order to
to respond to the situation of each young person. This set of taps in
load should propose measures ranging from supply restorer (mediation,
consultation group ...) to the investment public protection institutions
Youth (IPPJ). Particular attention will be given to the inclusion
charge after JVIS to promote the social reintegration and / or the family
young.
PS proposes to:


develop a diversified support offer fast, efficient order
to avoid the feeling of impunity among the young;



strengthen all alternatives to placement in IPPJ
(mediation, services of general interest, intensive follow-up with family or
the living environment ...);



evaluate, for the sake of institutional coherence, measures to
support youth after IPPJ investment, that is to say,
post-institutional support, equity in post-load IPPJ
performed by ESIS, the supported performed by sections

and observation, educational monitoring
Intensive family, directed by SPJ;



reorganize the educational projects of IPPJ which it appears that the

It is necessary to strengthen the synergies between administrations within the

develop an integrated approach to childhood and youth.
To achieve this goal, the PS proposes to:


and operators in the fight against poverty and inequality
Social:

by developing a partnership between the Directorate-General for aid

poverty and social exclusion of children and their families;

o

by establishing a platform for dialogue "Reducing

structural dialogue with the Walloon network fighting against poverty;

o

by developing synergies with the Brussels authorities

If everyone calls for the cross between administrations and
sectors, it is clear that the compartmentalized organization of sectors and
administrations makes this very complex pooling. Promoters
transversal projects are facing logical and regulations
different or even contradictory.
To support social innovation and remove obstacles to the cross, the PS
proposes:


facilitate the development of cross-sectoral projects allowing
operators to introduce a single folder evaluated according to criteria
concerted eligibility between administrations and controlled so
joint with common criteria;



recenter the authorized service category called "educational projects



ETHICS AND BIOETHICS
Fort struggles of recent years in terms of freedoms
individual, the PS will defend his victories, notably in
euthanasia of minors, and fight so that advanced harvested in
concerning the right to abortion or the right to die in dignity do weaken
not before the resurgence of conservative positions.
For the PS, the fighting of land can not be divested. Generations
current and future should enjoy a legal framework allowing them to
lead their lives and make choices that affect them intimately in full
freedom of conscience.
Beyond this resistance against the decline of wills on freedoms
individual, PS wishes to continue reflection and enable advanced
laws so that every citizen can find in the Belgian company,
listening, understanding and support of his distress. (See as well
Chapter Equality)

D EFENDRE THE RIGHT TO DIE FOR THE YEARS digni TE

More than ten years after the decriminalization of euthanasia, renewed
discussions in the Senate as part of a widening of the legislation to
minors was an opportunity to see reappear positions challenging the
achievements of 2002. Neither bill disinformation of certain lobbies, nor
conservative resolutions of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe
not lead to any waiver of the PS in the matter.
In contrast, the PS will continue to be clearly claims and
progressive. It offers:


relentlessly defend the right of every person to die with dignity;



further reflection on the possibility of proposing a legal framework
authorizing the inclusion of forward declarations of will in
the late stages of degenerative mental diseases type



to refer the application to a colleague;

P rotect DR ILO A ABORTION

As for euthanasia, abortion rights known, especially in the sphere
European, virulent attacks anti-abortion conservative circles.
To ensure compliance with the law and ensure that a voluntary termination
pregnancy (abortion) can take place in a short time with a team
competent medical, the PS proposes several initiatives:

3.



defend the right to abortion and the priority given to the choice of
wife ;



include in the university curriculum physician candidates, a
training and education devoted to abortion so that the shortage of
doctors able to practice such intervention is curbed;



raise the age below which the [contraceptive pill / contraception]
is issued free of charge in family planning centers;



ensure that all contraceptives are subject to
information campaigns to that in a couple of contraception
Men can be considered as an alternative to the pill
contraceptive;



educate pharmacists on the role of information they should be able
Ensure the face of women and girls that solicit for
a morning-after pill.

E NCADRER GE THE STATION OTHERS

Many people who can not procreate naturally can not or
do not want to turn to adoption or procreation medically
assisted. Using a third wife for it lends its assistance to
parental project of a couple raises many ethical questions. Such
practices which potentially have extreme consequences on the lives of
individuals involved, must be strictly regulated by law.
The legislation adopted by various foreign governments for use of
surrogate mother showed undesirable drifts. Lack thereof
any regulation in Belgium has given rise to certain commercial drifts
in particular. The PS wants whenever a legislative framework be adopted
Belgium. This framework must above all protect the woman who accepts such
engagement, in that it is the most vulnerable part in such a process.
Specifically, the PS proposes to:


prohibit any form of commercialization of surrogacy,
and any form of advertising;



ensure the possibility for the woman who agrees to engage in
Surrogacy the right to change his mind and to establish its
394

filiation with regard to her unborn child during pregnancy and up
two months after birth;


imposing on the author of the parental project and woman who agrees to be
surrogate mother to be assisted by a reproduction center
assisted;



impose on the parties to conclude an agreement with the help of the center
medically assisted procreation for the settlement of all aspects of
Surrogacy, including medical expenses related to the
pregnancy and childbirth, the loss of professional income for
surrogate mother, mode of decision-making in case of problems during
pregnancy, risk of malformation or risk of life-threatening
the unborn child;



prohibit the woman who agrees to be a surrogate mother to be
egg donor for the child to develop.

Meanwhile, the PS wants the regulations in respect of adoption or
revised to make it more accessible. The proposals in the
This chapter on Surrogacy do not affect the right
women to control their own bodies, as well as the strict legal equality
between adoptive filiation and genetic parentage.

395

WORSHIP
PS is determined to build a society where everyone, whatever their
philosophical or religious beliefs, can flourish with his
free will. In our society which expresses cultural diversity can
function smoothly and that everyone has its place, it is
essential to build and defend a common values ​​and
principles of living together. It is inconceivable that in a context of
Political secularism, which establishes a mode of government
independent of the various philosophical and religious ideas.
The State shall promote and encourage the sharing of common values ​​between
different communities living in Belgium. For the PS, the political secularism
(that is to say the separation of Church and State) and Human Rights
should be the common denominator of our society.
In this context, the PS reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the principles
following:
 respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms;
 equal rights between women and men;
 the rule of civil law on religious prescribed;
 the separation of church and state: the state exercises its power and accepts
General Interest religious duties without interference;
 freedom of worship and freedom of conscience, every human being is free
to practice the religion of their choice, or practice no;
 tolerance and openness to the world.
These values ​​are inalienable and it is in their respect solutions to
Specific issues to be developed.
The PS therefore proposes:


promote in all public places, the adoption of a Charter
Citizenship of the rights and duties of each and the
principles of political secularism and human rights;



remove any sign symbolizing an ostentatious convictionnel
religious or philosophical conception on building walls
public, such as courts or communal houses;



ensure that each user of a public service is guaranteed
impartial service quality and equal treatment on the part of
agents, who shall refrain from any behavior that would
because the necessary neutrality of public services;



establish a citizenship classes in schools centered on living together,
philosophical questioning and the history of religion and thoughtsecular, instead of hours or denominational courses
secular morality;



prohibit any exception based on religious conceptions monitoring
compulsory school curriculum. For the PS, each student must follow
physical education, science classes and educational courses
emotional and sexual if organized by the school;
396



ensure in bioethical debates, to prohibit any conscience clause
institutional and keep only the individual conscience clause
(thus, for example, a hospital may not invoke the "conscience"
to refuse to apply a law, as opposed to doctor
individual).

For the PS, religious freedom is a fundamental principle that should be
respect and protect.
In this context, the PS proposes to:


open a broad discussion to amend the current system of
funding for organized secularism and religions, in order to make it more
transparent, equitable and in line with developments in
company ;



continued recognition
devoting a fair financing;



create an interuniversity institute devoted to the study of Islam, like
what exists in other religions, would be responsible among other
build, in collaboration with Muslim religious authorities, a
"Islam of Belgium 'and would form the Islamic religion teachers
and imams.

DEMOCRACY
1.

TRENGTHENING CITOYENN THE SUMMER AND DEMOCRACY

At a time when democracies celebrate the centenary of the First War
World and facing a antipolitics feeling constantly increasing, it is
an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the values ​​indissoluble
democratic. For the PS, democracy must be strengthened every day.
1.1. LEDRO IT DEVOTECOMMEP IL IERFONDAM TALDELAD É IN DEMOCRACY
The election, that is to say the choice by all citizens of their
Representatives and leaders, is a key moment of democratic life.
For the PS, the vote must be accessible and understandable to the largest
number, whatever their knowledge, their social situation, their origin or
nationality.
Because voting is an essential cement of our democracy, the PS
recalls its commitment to the duty to vote. While many states
democratic complain about the low turnout at elections,
especially among the working classes, our system of compulsory voting
allows the expression of all citizens - not just more
educated or more interested - and gives elected wide legitimacy.
Besides maintaining compulsory voting, the PS offers:


improving the access of older persons to vote by installing
polling stations in nursing homes, organizing
public transport to the offices on voting day or a
educating workers about the importance of access to voting
for everyone ;



elimination of prior administrative procedures in the vote
must make disabled people to be assisted
the polling booth and which constitute an obstacle to the vote of those persons;



extending the right to vote for foreigners legally resident in
Belgium for at least 5 years, in all elections.
Currently, foreign individuals, from whether a Member State
EU, can vote for elections alone
communal. Participate in the City of life should be a matter of
citizenship, not just national;



deleting e-voting. Besides the issue of the cost of voting
electronics (five times higher than the cost of paper vote), PS considers
that democratic voting issues (accessibility, transparency, confidentiality
and citizen control) can not be deleted on the grounds of the alleged
logistical benefits that allow electronic voting.

The objective of the 6th state reform is to improve the efficiency of our
institutional structure and impose accountability. Further more
greater autonomy for regions and communities, we must also
398

mechanisms that empower women and politicians active in
federal level to all concerned citizens, regardless of the
area their home.
Currently, voters can only vote for candidates of their
own language area.
The PS proposes that:


15 members of the House of Representatives are elected in a
federal riding to allow Belgians are domiciled
in Wallonia, Brussels and Flanders, to vote for the woman or
the politician they want.
1.2. F O R R E N C E R L A C T I O N E Y IN SUMMER

If the free vote is a necessary condition for democracy, the fact is
not alone. To function optimally, democracy actually
need informed citizens, aware of their rights and involved in the life
Democratic, beyond the only time to vote.
To strengthen citizenship, the PS proposes to:


introduce, from an early age, a common course of education
citizenship, in accordance with the principles of neutrality:
o

centered on living together and philosophical questioning,
instead of one hour during religious or moral
secular;

o

with benchmarks and specific bases;

o

including learning of democratic values, values
of Human Rights, of living together and values
historical approach of the philosophies of religion and thought
secular;

This proposal is an essential step to reunite children
with a view to living together;


encourage young people to engage in voluntary work with the
voluntary sector or public non-profit sector by facilitating the
contact between the young and an association that offers the possibility
perform volunteer work by creating an Internet platform
showing the possibilities of such a voluntary commitment by
district, sector and type of proposed activity;



invest in civic eduction and the fight against racism and extreme
right by supporting or initiating ad hoc or permanent shares



recall the duty to remember and reaffirm our democratic values,



will lead to legislative initiatives.

A I A FFIRMER DENTITY WALLONNE

The studies highlight the importance of mobilizing the assertion of an identity
regional, open to the world, as a major factor in any cross
development project. On this basis, the PS had ensured the inclusion in the
Declaration Walloon regional policy for 2009-2014 of part
the affirmation of a Walloon identity as open and trust factor
mobilization.
More than ever a serene and proud self-consciousness is the condition for
confidence necessary for a population to meet the challenges of
the future in the context of regional autonomy still significantly strengthened
the sixth state reform.
This confidence, source of mobilization, feeds on socioeconomic dynamics driven by the strategy of the Marshall Plan that the entire
PS program intends to support and amplify. It also feeds on
mobilization inclusive and universal cultural project, part of the reality and the
Walloon territory.
In support of these core elements, the PS supports the continued production
and distribution of informative and educational tools enabling citizens to
all ages know and appropriating Wallonia in its multiple facets,
both through his past that his project, its values ​​and its strengths.

INSTITUTIONAL
1.

M AINTAIN COUNTRY STA BILISE

In 2010, our country was on the verge of collapse, plunged into a political crisis
threatening the very existence of our institutions, pointed to by the
world, seen by some as completely paralyzed and the prey of
financial speculators.
The PS had then promised to bring the country out of this crisis. Here we are
reached: the sixth state reform, one of the most important that we
have known, is now a reality. For the first time in 200, thanks
within the meaning of the condition of the socialist family, government institutions operate
again in the service of all citizens, despite the split ambitions and
to destabilize the country supported by some political forces.
From 1 July 2014 the regions and communities will receive new
skills for a total of over 20 billion euros,
primarily in the following areas: employment, family, health benefits
and helping people. This will enable them to carry out more targeted policies
and adapted to the needs of Walloons and Flemings of Brussels.
The federal state, he will focus on the key areas for citizens
that include social security, pensions, justice, defense
National or safety of persons and property.
For the PS, all energies must now focus on
implementation of these new transfers of competence, trusting
in the potential Walloons, Brussels and Francophone.
Welcoming new skills must be carefully prepared and
coordinated to ensure continuity of public service to citizens and
businesses and legal certainty.
The implementation of the sixth state reform implies indeed to prepare
the practical consequences: human resources, buildings, ICT, etc. From
Similarly, it will be necessary to reorganize the work of the parliamentary assemblies
the federated entities to account for new skills.
Already the foundation for a model intrafrancophone skills management
health, assistance to persons and family allowances are set in
through agreements called "the St. Emilie," whose realization in
legal texts is now imminent.
In such a context, and when so many things remain to be done if the
Belgium new a reality, it would be completely irresponsible to
embark on the adventure some institutional envisioned in a logical
dismantling of the country, contempt Walloons and denial
the Brussels identity.

401

The PS therefore calls resolutely to implement, following the
elections, government able to tackle the economic problems
and social, and not to open an institutional crisis which, again,
State lead to immobility.
If necessary, the SP will oppose vigorously any attempt to empty the state
Federal substance, nullifying interpersonal solidarity
Belgian and generally harm the interests of francophones,
Walloons, Brussels and German.
In the future, the stability and prosperity of New Belgium will rely again
more than today, the ability of the federal State, Regions and
Communities to cooperate and pool their forces.
The next Parliament must be an opportunity to strengthen this dialogue through
the meeting place that is the consultative committee but also by the
conclusion of cooperation agreements between various levels of authority,
especially in the context of the newly transferred competencies to
Regions and Communities.
The metropolitan community, one of the many achievements of the sixth reform
the state must be set up and become a privileged instrument in
Brussels hinterland for matters having cross-regional importance.
For PS, a mature federalism is necessarily based on mutual respect.
It ensures, in particular, respect for linguistic minorities.
In this context, the PS will ensure the consolidation of peace Community
and respect the rights of francophones in the Brussels periphery and
Fourons to preserve them from any harassment and vexation Community.
The teaching in French schools will be preserved.
Beyond the major advances made in favor of the Francophone minority
under the sixth state reform (the electoral system applicable to
six peripheral municipalities is constitutionally guaranteed, voters
will have the opportunity to vote for a list of the constituency of Brussels-Capital, the general meeting of the State Council is responsible for
Dispute on 6 peripheral municipalities, a new
mayors of appointment process is organized, the rights of
Halle-Vilvoorde Francophone retain the possibility to be treated and judged in
their own language, several advances are planned to improve employment
languages ​​in civil, etc.), the PS will continue to demand the ratification
by Belgium of the Framework Convention for the Protection of Minorities
National Council of Europe.

This federated entity full of the Belgian federal state, still significantly

Given the new common linguistic specificities that compose it.
The German citizens are entitled to an administration and information
perfectly adequate when it comes to powers exercised by both
the federal government by Wallonia in the territory of the language region
German.
The SP hopes to:


ensure full implementation of the law on the use of languages ​​in
administrative matters.

The PS supports, moreover, collaboration unites for nearly fifteen years
German-speaking Community and the Walloon Region within the framework of an agreement
already strengthened cooperation.
PS hears:


promote common and mutually reciprocal actions
profitable in the areas of foreign trade, stimulation
economic and business transfers, tourism,
land, telecommunications, transport
education, environment, health, social action, the
statistical, administrative simplification, coordination
public works, education and worship.

Concerning requests for transfers to the regional expertise
German-speaking Community, achievable under Article 139 of the
Constitution, the PS has always been open to dialogue. Since 1994, this
Opening enabled transfer of skills relating to monuments, sites
and excavations, to employment, to church factories and funerals and burials, to
general financing of municipalities and the organization and exercise of guardianship
on common administrative and police areas. Under this term, to
the initiative of a Socialist minister, it has also led to retransfer
Immediate tourism regionalised as part of the sixth reform.
In the last legislature, the PS has actively participated in discussions
considered conveying new regional powers to the Community
German. He wanted their outcome in several areas.
In the next legislature, he hears that the negotiations already well
technically involved, lead to concrete results and new
advanced. It goes without saying that it is necessary to ensure the citizens of the Community
German public service that is non-discriminatory compared to
enjoyed by other citizens of the Walloon Region.
In this sense, the PS wants to open a constructive debate and will:


defend the transfer to the German Community Skills

remaining on common, those relating to housing or
even those relating to employment, recently regionalized by state
Federal.
In addition, the PS notes the positions defended by the Community
German in the policy statement of June 27, 2011 on its
positioning in the process of state reform and is committed to
continue the dialogue.

TAXATION
Faced with the danger of a return to old recipes right which offer
draining public finances, the beginnings of social regression
widespread, the PS affirms its desire to strengthen and promote a social model
based on the economic and social and fiscal justice.
To make public services and social protection accessible to all
and reduce economic and social inequalities, the SP wants to lead a
fiscal policy based on a fair contribution to public finances.
The increasing share of capital income in the wealth produced and
Taxation based predominantly on labor income and
Household consumption gradually induced a distribution
inequality of wealth.
Taxes are based for 70% on labor income (PPI) and the
household consumption (VAT and excise duties) which is a very large share
financed by labor income.
This disparity is also reflected in an unequal distribution of
wealth: 10% of the wealthiest households hold 44% of the portfolio
while 10% in less affluent own less than 1%.
The PS wants therefore continue its efforts during the previous legislature
which allowed significantly rebalance taxation based on
income from capital on the one hand and income from work, on the other.
We need to tax more, no more.
For the PS, taxation must take into account the fiscal capacity of each and
rely on the principle of progressive taxation, taking better account of
income level.
The recovery goal of our public finances is about to bear
fruit.
Time is not a new adventure that would lead to budget
increasing the burden of interest on public debt, which would lead to pressure
on social security, public services and workers.
Financial management must also take into account solidarity with
future generations and the need to ensure the financial viability of the State
Federal confronted with the costs of aging.
This is why the PS intends to pursue this fiscal policy framework
neutral fiscal developing a lighter tax burden on labor income,
targeted at low and middle income, offset by a fairer taxation
capital income.
Economically, the SP wants to corporate taxation, a tool
support the real economy. Taxation must serve a targeted policy
405

on employment, innovation, training and sustainable productive investment, with
a focus on SMEs. It should be an encouragement to
economic recovery and based on measures pursuing objectives
clear that substitute for linear measurements, the effects are insufficient.
The PS also intends to strengthen efforts in the fight against
tax evasion by integrating the European dimension.
For the PS, it is essential to move forward at European level both in terms of
fight against tax havens and aggressive tax planning groups
multinational, as the tax harmonization plan in the fight against
the fiscal and social dumping between states.
The sixth state reform has given the important skills Regions
taxation. If earlier these skills related to
Essentially, the property tax and vehicle taxation, they concern
today also an important part of the personal income tax and
tax expenditures (tax reductions) related to regional competences.
In this context, economic and institutional, the PS intends to pursue a policy
fairer tax, which better reflects the contributive capacity of Walloons
that promotes access to housing, which stimulates the economic fabric and creating
Job.
PS hears finally encourage more respectful behavior
the environment taking into account the household resources by
adapted approaches.

The PS wants to reduce taxation on labor income, primarily on low and
average incomes.
Thanks to public services and social protections, households in Belgium
does not see forced, as is the case in countries marked by
liberal domination, directly and fully to assume the cost of needs
as basic as school or health care.
However, many workers, whether employees or independent
public servants, experiencing financial difficulties in everyday life.
This has already prompted the reduction in VAT on electricity we
obtained.
The PS will continue to improve the situation of these workers by
increase in their disposable income, using the margins by
fairer taxation on capital.

406

PS proposes to:

2.



increasing the net income of workers by targeting low priority
and income means, converting to "gain pocket" part of
deductions at source;



continue to gradually increase the tax and social employment bonus
so that at least 70% of workers can benefit from increased
Pocket salary of up to 110 euros per month;



establish a tax bonus plus for young workers;



create an additional tax credit representing a net gain of 120
euros per month for all workers with a net income of less than
3,000 euros per month, which would have the right to go to early retirement
but choose to keep working;



improve tax credits for public service workers
and self-employed to ensure an equivalent gain in pocket
all workers with low and medium incomes.

R EEQUILIBRER TAXAT THE ION BETWEEN INCOME AND CAPITAL
EARNINGS FROM WORK

For the PS, it is essential to rely on the principle of capacity
Contributory: everyone participates according to its ability to contribute to
collective needs.
This participation must operate in respect of both horizontal equity
and vertical: all income shall contribute gradually.
In this context, the globalization of revenue is the ideal to be achieved while
taking care not to increase taxation on labor and on small savings.
Its entry into force, however, requires the development of tools
to have a better understanding of income regardless of their nature.
Without this prerequisite, the globalization of revenue and the removal of
withholding tax could have the paradoxical effect of not taxing power
effectively than income already known, namely those of work, and
not involve capital income to the extent of small savings.
Yet tax revenue comes mainly labor income
and household consumption, while the tax on capital will
represents a smaller share of the tax revenue, even though the share
capital income in the wealth produced has increased.
Priority is therefore important to continue the efforts undertaken during the
previous legislature, to move towards a better balance between taxation on
labor income and capital, while supporting the real economy and everything
preserving small savings.

407

This fight for a better contribution of capital to collective needs must
also be conducted at European level by integrating a dimension of struggle
against fiscal and social dumping.
Specifically, the PS proposes to:

3.



take all necessary measures to raise capital and help
reduce taxation on labor;



introducing a solidarity contribution on larger estates with
a progressive scale in tranches (in excess of 1.25 million euros
outside the apartment building and assets assigned to the business
professional) ;



to end the exemption for capital gains realized on
shares held by individuals;



extend the current tax regime to all capital gains realized on
shares or units held by companies;



reform the tax treatment of stock options in the fiscalisant
capital gains actually obtained (instead of the lump taxation that exists
currently);



terminate the existing privilege for income deduction
definitively taxed by involving the European standard and limit this
benefit to the equity participation thresholds of at least 10%;



develop tools for a better understanding of
all income which will allow better understanding of the
progressivity / regressivity of our tax system;



keep fighting to establish a transaction tax
Financial (FTT) to fight against speculation, the scope
Application covers transactions on all shares,
bonds, foreign exchange and derivatives of any kind, in
integrating all financial institutions active in
transaction related to a security issued in a member state and therefore do
not limited
to institutions located in the territory of the Union
European;



promote the establishment of a progressive tax on income
capital at European level and a tax on large estates (with
a base defined at European level).

Economic, whether the creation of new businesses or
development of existing businesses.

408

Rather than proceeding to linear tax reductions, whose effectiveness has
its limitations, the PS intends to target its fiscal policy of support for the benefit of
economic activity.
These targeted measures that better reflect the volume
and job creation, innovation, training and investments
sustainable production.
As part of a dynamic economic and fiscal policy that supports
recovery, particular attention should be given to SMEs, which
cover 67% of employment in our country and are very sensitive to
relocation.
This is why the PS proposes to "recycle" notional interest.
The budget end of this complete overhaul of the interests of the regime
notional must be reassigned to policies aimed primarily at
support SMEs, job creation, investment, training and
innovation.
Many innovative SMEs fail to muster the means
sufficient to market only their product. This funding problem
is particularly acute in the biotechnology sector. Too often,
only alternative for the company is selling his patent with the risk of
relocation of production and knowledge. For the PS, you have to think about
a similar tax incentive in the tax shelter set up for production
of audiovisual works to allow these innovative companies to benefit
a tax exemption for investments made without loss
means between the company and the investor due to the intervention of a
intermediary.
For the PS, the tax measures should reflect the mutual commitment
Government, on the one hand and businesses on the other, to support the
development of the real economy and the business world to ensure the
creation and maintenance of employment, continuing training of workers and
promoting economic growth model focusing on growth
sustainable.
Specifically, the PS proposes to:


recycle means connected to the notional interest scheme for the benefit of
SMEs and job creation;



double the current deduction for investment for SMEs when
These are investments that generate stable employment or investment
in Research and Development;



provide an additional increase of the investment deduction
for SMEs (see previous point) when investments
concerned are funded by equity;



encourage companies that invest in training their
workers by introducing a deduction increased to 120%;
409



raise the exemption rate of withholding tax payment
for SMEs who maintain their employment level to help these
companies without affecting workers' wages, and amplify it
even for those who create new jobs;



encourage companies to increase their volume of employment,
doubling the share of tax-exempt income for the recruitment
additional staff in SMEs (firms with less than 11
workers);



facilitate the launch of new businesses by removing any
tax surcharge in the event of the absence or insufficiency of payments
anticipated the first five years;



support the growth of SMEs by allowing them to enjoy for a
minimum of 5 years, tax benefits they are entitled
(now, when success is with go, an SME can lose
tax benefits (eg loss of the reduced rate) because of its
Change (increase in staff, increase in profit ...));



grant targeted, new individual companies that
create a single lump and tax relief to the IPP during the five
first years of activity;



examine the possibility of applying a regime "tax shelter" for SMEs

between potential investors and the company;



establish a tax deduction (tax deduction for targeted investment)

States are mostly confronted for several years to
financial difficulties. Their efforts, they go through a management of their
public spending or a change in their revenue levels are
however, and for too long undermined by the persistence of countries and
territories which may be characterized as tax and banking havens.
These areas are home to the legal and economic structures that organize
tax fraud operations which deprive other states
tax revenue on the wealth produced on their territory.
The revelations of the "Offshore Leaks' have highlighted the extent of the
phenomenon that requires a constant and strong reaction by measures
appropriate.
Beside this sophisticated fraud, remains in Belgium a level of economy
underground (turnover and unreported income) as very important
many studies show.
Tax justice relies primarily on the principle that everyone must contribute
according to established rules.
The PS has already achieved considerable progress, notably by establishing a
real anti-abuse measure, obtaining the lifting of bank secrecy in
guaranteeing the disappearance of bearer securities, increasing the capacity of
detection operations channeled through tax havens, strengthening law
on money laundering by requiring the goods declaration
insurance of prisoners abroad and offshore structures.
The PS intends to continue this fight at national level and

P PROMOTE ACCESS TO HOUSING

(See also Chapter housing)
In no time, the price of real estate built and unbuilt suffered in Wallonia
significant increases.
This inflation is mainly due to the insufficient supply of housing
acquisitive quality on the market.
Taxation has to be a tool to promote access to property

including real estate speculation following the abandonment, or vacancy

intended for housing).
In parallel with the provision of public housing, we must encourage the private sector to

affordable and thus alleviate the housing pressure. These incentives
construction of residential buildings should be confined to the territories
central in rural and urban areas if the property is new in order not
encourage dispersed settlement
If the construction of new housing, both public and private, can alleviate
real estate pressure, it is not enough to restore a balance between supply and
demand in the private rental market. It is necessary to establish a
fiscal policy to support owners who maintain their property in
good condition and lease them at a reasonable price and empower owners
non-respect for the welfare of their tenants.
High tariffs are likely to curb the purchase of a first home by
a young couple. These rights must therefore be modulated to end
this brake.
Duty reduction can also encourage the maintenance of the elderly
in their home as long as possible, with the support of their families.
Some survivors also face difficulties to
face to inheritance tax so that this succession concerns only the
family home often purchased together. When this property is the
simple dwelling and that it is not extravagant, these rights are a
look particularly iniquitous.
To meet these objectives, the PS proposes to:


optimize for future mortgages, the tax benefit for
sole own dwelling - now regionalized - targeting
more support on the early years of the acquisition;



introducing a real escalation registration fees for
acquiring a first and only modest dwelling, reducing
rates on the first installments of the purchase price thereof;



provide for a fixed reduction in the property tax



encourage owners to value their undeveloped land, located within
central areas in rural and urban areas, to avoid retention
land and to fight against real estate speculation by providing
dissuasive taxation of owners of these lands
(rights holders for 8 years and older, unless the vacancy is due to
a case of force majeure and from a floor area);



extend to all areas of rehabilitation and urban revitalization and
rural development schemes as the decrease in VAT of 21
6% on demolition operations / reconstruction of buildings

private sector to build housing in the central territories



OF
THE ENVIRONMENT IN TEN ANT ACCOUNT BAS R EVENUE

In international comparison, it appears that environmental taxation is
less present in Belgium than in other countries of the European Union.
However, an appropriate fiscal policy should encourage behaviors
environmentally friendly while being socially just.
Some measures in ecological character have a greater impact with
financially vulnerable people because a larger share of their
income is, for example, on energy and they have no or little
ability to change behavior in contrast to high income
can finance alternative methods

415

For the PS, environmental taxation should not reduce the progressivity and
redistributive nature of our tax system. It is therefore essential when predict
compensation and support measures for low incomes.
To encourage local production, pollution-induced long
transport should be better taken into account and the origin of goods where the
country is less environmentally and conditions
workers.
In this respect, the proposed PS:


corporate responsibility to respect social norms and
Environmental throughout their production chain by
the establishment of a European anti-dumping mechanism in which the non-compliance standards would be subject to a levy assigned to
relevant international institutions, such as the ILO, which will ensure
the gradual implementation of these standards in the most affected countries;



ensure that any environmental tax measure takes into
consider the aspect of "contributory capacity" of citizens so that they
are not penalized by these measures when their resources do their
allow changing behavior.

In Wallonia, the PS offers:


complete the implementation on 1 January 2016 the road toll
distance for vehicles over 3.5 tonnes as
negotiated between the country's three Regions;



integrating environmental criteria in road taxes and
circulation, taking care not to penalize citizens who have
not afford to buy new cars that emit little





evaluate the mechanism of "cost-truth" and apply a tax on

companies to treat their waste, giving priority
the most environmentally friendly techniques, and
strengthening the social measures for the benefit of the household
vulnerable to reduce the cost of the bill.

PUBLIC ENTERPRISES
For the PS, it is essential to reaffirm the strategic importance of having
quality public services. The action allows public companies in this regard
ensure the maintenance of public service missions in areas as
diverse as mobility, postal services or telecommunications to do
name but three. For the PS, these missions are a collective achievement that
generates social gains which should continue to benefit citizens to a
affordable price.
For the PS, the state must retain control over its public enterprises and
continue to improve their governance. Significant gains have been
garnered by the PS to this legislature as limiting
remuneration, banning golden parachutes and stock options. These
Efforts should be continued and expanded during the next Parliament.

1.

PROTECT THE PUBLIC SERVICE

The European Union, dominated by conservative parties, imposed a
liberalization in many sectors, but these experiences liberalization or
privatization caused disastrous effects like reduced quality
service, the increase in prices, pressure on employment and a decrease
geographical accessibility.
After the liberalization of telecom and postal sectors, the European Commission
now works for the liberalization of public transport and intends to subject
VAT utilities and the non-profit sector. Decisions
Important soon intervene in this area, given the negotiating
During the "fourth railway package". The liberalization of certain swathes of
public services has yet clearly shown its limits. That is why the PS
is resolutely opposed to the liberalization of public services that
now the European authorities.
The PS is convinced that the essential missions of public service must
remain in the bosom of the State to ensure management in the interest
General.
Also, the PS intends to defend a broad vision of public services, which are
public services at all levels of government and in the first level
European. In Belgium, it is appropriate to use the maximum flexibility
left by European legislation to ensure best accessibility for all
services at an affordable price.
To restore the primacy of public services and defend, the PS offers
of:


support at European level the adoption of a framework directive on
services of general interest, which would give public services and
services of general interest ensuring a stable legislative framework and
adequate funding, in compliance with the principles of universality,
continuity and equal access;
417



and accessibility of services for citizens in premium effective and
agents working conditions;



subtract the social services of general interest to the market law;



better inform citizens on the rationale of public spending and
their use for the general interest.

STRENGTHENING THE CONTROL OF THE STATE ON BUSINESS
PUBLIC

Since the crisis of 2008, which is above all a crisis of deregulation
financial sector, pressure is exerted on the Belgian State for it to reduce its
participation in public enterprises. For the PS, the shareholder role
the state is fundamental and must be preserved.
What for ? For the general interest must prevail over individual interests. It's here
why privatization is hardly compatible with the service
public. When a private investor requires more financial performance of a service
public issued to the public, this is done too often to the detriment of
universality of service or quality.
How? The PS is in favor of a more active management policy and
Work of state shareholdings. Nothing at the federal level, these
Entries are now fragmented, the result of an evolution
History not always coordinated. The PS is in favor of reunification
these investments in a centralized and strengthened body, such as the Company
Federal Participation and Investment, working closely with Finance and
Economy. The state will be able to ensure better coordination between its
economic policy and the interests it holds in some sectors
keys. The goal is not to make decisions instead of management
but to ensure a better public administration.
2.1.

FURTHER REFORM OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FOR MAKING
EXEMPLARY

The legislature that ends allowed, at the initiative of Ministers PS, print
concrete progress in the field of corporate governance
public. At the federal level, notably include the widespread ban
use of management companies to the members of the Executive Committee
(which allowed to avoid payment of personal income tax), the
capping the salaries of directors (CEO) of the SNCB, Infrabel, in
Belgocontol, the National Lottery, and the FSMA or the SFPI
reducing the salary of CEO of Belgacom and bpost. In the federated entities,
the same work was done to limit the salaries of management positions
in public bodies.

418

To further improve the governance of public enterprises,
PS proposes to:
 enshrine in law the salary limitation measures decided in this
legislature and expand to other public corporations, including;
o limiting the salaries of managing directors and other
Member of the steering committee of public enterprises;
o limiting severance benefits to 12 months' fixed remuneration,
non-competition included compensation for directors
Delegates and members of the Executive Committee;
o the prohibition of stock options to directors and delegates
Member of the Executive Committee;
 clarify the evaluation of managing directors in particular by
better advertising of criteria and indicators used for the variable part
their remuneration;
 moderate the meeting fees for directors, considering the load
of work.
In the same vein, the PS also wants to strengthen the legal rules
applicable independence, incompatibilities and conflicts of interest
administrators.
PS proposes to:


broaden the criteria of incompatibility at any mandate, function or activity
exercised for a competitor;



broaden the criteria of incompatibility and conflict of interest functions,
mandates and activities of the spouse or legal partner and relatives
direct;



provide for the forfeiture of the right to public office in severe cases;



prohibit the administrator to deliberate in case of conflict of interest;



adopt a charter of public office which should legally
subscribe all public administrator at the time of designation;



limit the number of directorships that a Commissioner and
same person may hold.

2.2.

DEVELOPING A STRATEGIC VISION FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES

The PS wants to tighten control of the State as shareholder of
public enterprises and improve the quality of management within cellesci. For this, the PS seeks to establish a genuine public management strategy
its public undertakings in the general interest. This will better
coordinate the actions of different entities and can impact more
effectively our social market economy.

419

For this, the PS proposes to:


retain a majority stake of the state in business
public where it exists;



exercise greater control over decisions and strategy including
providing that public administrators are called upon to:



3.

o

devote the time necessary for the proper performance of their duties,
this under the control of the Government Commissioner and
penalties up to revocation;

o

engage in lifelong learning processes;

consolidate the state's holdings in a single institution
public would become a competence center for
public participation and support to administrations.

COMMUNITY

AND

OF

For the PS, public companies have a threefold responsibility.
The first with respect to the community to which they must provide
high quality services. The pressure on public finances can this
respect question the public service tasks that are essential to
operation of the community.
Furthermore, the State, through these public enterprises should set an example of a
optimal management of resources in the interest of the welfare of workers. The
public enterprises deliver essential services to the population. But
Belgacom, bpost and SNCB also represent 75,000 jobs, a figure
cumulative revenue of 10 billion euros. For ambitious policies, the PS
wishes the welfare of workers is a central concern of the
management of public enterprises.
Finally, public enterprises are also a powerful economic lever.
The PS wants them to play an active role in the fight against competition
Unfair, which destroys jobs in our SMEs, using public procurement
optimally. For the PS, public companies that are subject to the law
Procurement by their exemplary role, must systematically
consider the integration of social and environmental clauses in their
public procurement procedures in order to support SMEs, companies
social economy and sheltered workshops.
For this purpose, the proposed PS:


public enterprises play an active and leading role in the
training through the provision of internships, especially
in occupations in short supply;



implement measures against social dumping,
420

including through public procurement;

4.



encourage the establishment of social protocols to ensure that all
workers enjoy the good health of public enterprises;



guaranteed by law and the management contract of public services marked
social justice;



generalize, when awarding a public contract, the use of the offer
The most economically advantageous that in addition to price, other favors
criteria such as quality, compliance with social criteria or
environmental and sustainability;



gradually expand the use of social clauses and
environmental in public procurement taking into account the
nature of the market and the sector concerned and improve mechanisms for
monitoring compliance with the clauses in the award and execution of
markets;



integrate social clauses in particular socio-professional integration
for services such as the creation and maintenance of green spaces,
restoration and operation of canteens, collection,
management and treatment of waste or cleaning offices,
windows, sites;



allow associations representing people with mobility
reduced to give their opinion on the inclusion of persons
disabilities in investment decisions;



accelerate programs to reduce energy consumption
within public companies.

DEFEND PUBLIC POSTAL SERVICES QUALITY

Postal services are a basic public service for all of the
population. Today bpost performs many public service missions
essential for our fellow citizens, it is to preserve and strengthen the
future.
Universal service consisting in the delivery of mail and packages 5
days a week throughout the Belgian territory, guaranteeing
universal access and equality before the rates should continue to be insured
the future.
It is the same for the public service mission guaranteed by law and
fifth management contract (covering the period 2013-2015). These services
meet real needs of society and they support the goals
Social valuable. This is particularly the case of maintaining a wide
postal network and the distribution of pensions and home delivery of the
press home.
The network of offices and postal issues contributes to social cohesion
the whole territory and the opening up of rural and remote areas.
It must be maintained or strengthened in areas where the population in the
need - including major towns where the presence of a single office
421

is no longer sufficient. The daily contact factor contributes to cohesion
social, and the integration of the elderly and disabled.
Bpost should also be encouraged to exploit its core competencies and
makes it serves every day every house in the country to offer
new services that meet new needs of citizens. She must
fully grasp the opportunities offered by the development of e-commerce
and the increasing demand for home deliveries, to meet the needs
a number of specific target groups. The PS will remain attentive to the
future development and sustainability of the economic and social health
bpost, taking into account its social mission, client expectations,
the legitimate interests of employees. It is in these conditions that may bpost
continue to assume its leading role in the economic and social fabric
our country, including the level of employment. Transformations
Operating the business has experienced over the last 10 years have
greatly increased the productivity of the company's staff, which made it
difficult working conditions for postal workers (longer tours,
weight of mail bags, flexibility). Finally, the PS, companies
public, particularly bpost, have a role model in terms of
continuous training of their staff.
For the negotiations on the Sixth bpost management contract for
period 2016-2020, the PS proposes to:


strengthen the local network, especially in the areas most
remote;



improve opening hours of post offices;



reduce waiting times at the counter, particularly during the hours
peak ;



continue the dialogue strategy with staff and partners
social, taking into account the working conditions of workers and
the arduous nature of their tasks;



improve consultation between bpost and municipalities on the location
post offices;



launch a debate on the extension of public service missions, for
eg in the personal services sector, where the challenges
population aging are many;



promote the social role of factors, including the service "SVP
factors ", allowing the elderly or less mobile
seek help from a poster factor;



maintain the current network of 14,000 red mailboxes;

ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF RAIL SERVICE PUBLIC

The SNCB Group is and must remain a key player to meet the many
Mobility challenges in Belgium (see also Chapter Mobility).
With more than 223 million passengers a year, the train has grown
historical volume with nearly 50% in 10 years.
In the coming years, and the prospect of a new
liberalization of the European rail framework, it is now necessary to ensure the
quality of rail public service and sustain public anchoring activities
our public companies are the new SNCB and Infrabel.
Indeed, the quality of rail services should be strengthened to ensure that all
travelers, offers a complete, safe, attractive in terms of frequencies and
punctuality and environmentally.
PS means a substantial improvement of the quality of service while
guaranteeing affordable prices for users.
For the PS, SNCB should be listening to the public and serve the users
of the rail.

MEET THE PASSENGER

Citizens of travel needs are enormous. Mobility is therefore
a major issue in our society. , The track is, for the citizen, a mode
privileged access to work, school and leisure. As such, security,
timeliness and accessibility of the offer are the priority focus points of the
PS.

ENSURE THE MAINTENANCE OF AN OFFER INDUSTRIAL RAIL

The liberalization of rail freight transport, combined with the crisis
Economic, had serious consequences for the "freight" activities of the group
SNCB. The transformation of industrial activities in the whole of Belgium
led to profound modifications of railway tools (marshalling yards,
intermodal terminals, etc.). The "freight" activity nevertheless remains an issue

424

developing economic terms. This is why targeted support tools
by the railway freight transport have been developed by the government.
To promote development of a strategy for the transport of
Railway goods, the PS will:


maintaining rail infrastructure essential for redeployment
Economic Wallonia and Brussels;



meet the conditions for a rail service quality remains
accessible to the country's industries.

5.3.

A NEW ORGANIZATION FOR MORE EFFICIENCY AND SAFETY
SERVICE OF TRAVELLERS

Under this term, the SNCB Group has been profoundly reformed to develop
structures capable of preserving public services in a context of
can rail liberalization in Europe. Thus, the
Group activities have been divided between the infrastructure manager,
Infrabel and the new SNCB who now performs all activities related
motorcars. For the future, the SP wants to maintain the activities of these
only two companies in a public setting. Faced with threats
liberalization, the PS defends a public service of safe and efficient rail.
PS proposes to:


stabilize the new entities and reduce the number of subsidiaries,
Store in an exclusively public setting;



SNCB guarantee sufficient public resources to ensure it
its public service missions;

MAINTAIN THE STATUS OF RAILWAY

In recent years, the SNCB staff was strongly made
contribution. To realize the challenges of the reform of the SNCB group
meet the ambitious objectives described above, it is essential that
railwaymen feel really involved.
For the PS, the social dialogue must be strengthened, staff should be reassured
its fate in the company and benefit from stimulating working conditions.
HR rail, the joint venture with the new SNCB and Infrabel is now
the only employer of all railway workers.

425

The PS will be careful to ensure:


rail HR missions as a single employer, and in particular its
public mission of organization of service and social consultation
guarantor of the unique status of the railroad;



a single national joint committee;



the conclusion of a social agreement perpetuating the unique status of
railwaymen.

In the next legislature, the PS will therefore ensure qu'HR rail is able
to conclude a social agreement that perpetuates the unique status for
railwaymen.
5.5.

REFER TO USERS AND POPULATION

For the PS, the user must be at the center of the priorities of SNCB.
Beyond the fact that the reform structurally up the user at the center of
operation of railways, reform of the Users' Consultative Committee
decided during this legislature should be established.
For the PS, it is appropriate to strengthen the role of the Advisory Committee of users:


updating its composition to give a greater emphasis to
Representatives of travelers;



broadening its scope of intervention;



promoting the flow of information between the relevant bodies.

PUBLIC FUNCTION
For the PS, public services are essential to ensure a society more
fair and contribute to quality of life for all citizens. With the
social security, public services are powerful absorbers of
adverse consequences of economic and financial crises. They allow
maintain solidarity and are levers of competitiveness for the whole
the economy.
The development of public services plays a central role in improving
living conditions and the fight against social inequality: how
consider the creation of businesses, boosting employment, creativity without
quality education, without a childhood home network care
health or public transport accessible to all, but especially without the services
proximity made available to citizens.
The real challenge is not "less public services" but "better
public service " !
Effective administration is an administration that achieved the objectives it
have been assigned. It is furthermore efficient if it uses the resources it
offers optimum and sustainable manner. The objective of the PS is more than ever
service quality in accordance with public service values.
The civil service is the operational arm of government action. In this
Accordingly, we must rely on staff recruited on bases
objective, motivated, competent and user-oriented public services,
that is to say capable of developing an anticipation dynamics compared
to changes in society and expectations of users.
The administration and officials must be levers proposals,
Tips and initiatives. Public authorities must be aware of the
value of its intangible heritage that is the commitment of its
personnel, and to grant their public services all the attention
necessary for their development in the public interest.
Promote public service to serve the public, and accessible to all
quality, attracting talents, today is the best way to counter those
who by ideology, advocating the weakening of the public service by
blind downsizing and privatization. It is a challenge that the PS wants
meet with officials, their representative organizations and all
users of public services.
To restore the primacy of public services and defend, the PS offers
of:


support at European level, the adoption of a framework directive on
services of general interest, which would give public services and
services of general interest ensuring a stable legislative framework and
adequate funding, in compliance with the principles of universality,
continuity and equal access;
427



I NNOVER AND BOOST THE GESTI ON PUBLIC SERVICES

Over twenty years of reform in public services have developed there
quality management capacity. The challenge now is to capitalize on these
years of experience and to bring all public services to real
Management maturity.
This mature management must pursue three objectives:
 be open to society, that is to say anchored in utilities
preparation of long-term policies and, in this perspective, be
a proposal for strength and support to political action;
 continue the efforts of quality of services provided to citizens,
businesses, non-profit sector and other public entities (a
Grant, a bonus, a road, a judgment ...);
 make official, individually and in teams, both a
actor in the quality of public service and service Opening actor
public about the world and society in general.
In a changing world, public services must
further develop the ability to anticipate: for public service
tomorrow, success means to quickly detect these changes and adapt
its strategy accordingly. This is to strengthen the capacity and foresight
adaptability of the administration.
It is also important to emphasize a culture of accountability,
management by objectives and evaluation at every level of government.
Furthermore, as part of its modernization, the administration must integrate
new technological requirements. These lead to new ways to
designing public policy, involving increasing interactions
users, for example, by the web.
For the PS, it is essential that the proposed reforms are performed in strict
respect for social dialogue and those that it does not turn into
practice of fait accompli.
For a dynamic and innovative management of public services, the PS offers
of:


generalize the conclusion of the administrative or management contracts between
428

government / the Minister and the public service concerned,
laying down the objectives to be achieved;


to develop on this basis by management officials plans
Management will determine, among other things, the allocation of resources
human and logistic in relation to the tasks assigned to the service



make effective assessment of the evolution of objectives set by the
contracts administration and management plans and decline the logic
an effective assessment to each agent;



strengthen internal management and external controls and use of
public funds;



strengthen dialogue and cooperation between public authorities and
the services of the administration;



strengthen the role of support and expertise of public services for the benefit of
authority, notably by stimulating their vocation to make
proposals;



generalized evaluation of administrative action by putting in place
indicators to measure the progress of activities to
enable better transparency.

The PS also proposed:

E QUALITY

Placed in a context of constant innovations in working methods and
technologies, the public service is subject to increasing expectations on the part of
citizens and businesses. A satisfied user of public services is suddenly
sure the best ally in the defense and promotion of the role of government
in our society.
429

Administrative simplification does not mean less government, but rather
public services reinforced their quality, modernity and sense of
effective partnership. Users want more accessible, more
simpler, faster, more reliable, more transparent, more responsive to their
needs.
The priority is to put the user at the center of concerns and not him
to support the weight of long procedures and often repetitive. To
happen, it is necessary to develop a genuine culture of service in
utility creating a movement towards greater speed, a
timeliness, increased transparency, traceability in the treatment
folders and an optimal quality of service.
It is also to boost the computerization of services being attentive to reduce
the digital divide, since many users are still excluded from the use of
computers. It is also essential that the implementation of services
public makes possible proximity to the user on the entire territory.
To avoid the phenomenon of isolation, rural areas must benefit
Special attention.
Finally, it is necessary to ensure the independence, impartiality and transparency
Administration to amplify even more legitimate expectations that
citizens to public services.
To promote a "quality public service accessible to all," the PS
proposes:


further simplification and efforts for better readability
legislation, regulations and administrative procedures;



support governments in their mission to carry out an analysis
impact before implementation of any new legislation and
regulatory measure accurately the consequences of cellesci, both service to users on the administrative burden of
processing of files;



expand satisfaction surveys of the users so
improve services and better meet the expressed needs
by users and, in this framework, ensure consultation with the
voluntary sector and consumer associations;



create depth by the administrations of the conclusions,
reports and recommendations of mediation services, ombudsmen,
internal audits, the Court of Auditors, with the objective to propose
any changes in the process.


To improve the quality of services provided to users, the PS proposes to:


establish a charter of citizen-user to ensure compliance with
rights of users and better information;



readability and education regulations, procedures
430

and administrative decisions through better communication with
special attention to sections of the population most
vulnerable and people who do not have access to new
technologies;


facilitate administrative procedures, including the establishment
a single window and making available to users (individuals,
companies and associations) from a "bank-crossroads-administration"
allowing them to have access to standard forms for all
their approach and know at all times the status of
their record (subsidy, premium, driver ...)



promote respect for privacy, a trading system
information between the various administrative authorities of the country to
that known data administration should not be provided
each new request, even of a different nature;



improve information to citizens about the services offered
(institutional communication, brochures on the services offered, etc.);



ensure the quality of the content of websites of public services, their
readability and accessibility especially for blind or
visually impaired (labeling "any surfer");



promote swift, rigorous management of complaints,
including front-line public services in order to identify
recurring problems that require structural solution;



improve continuously, the reception of users in their contacts with
administration by investing in staff training in relation
with the public;



improve the accessibility of buildings, both physically
(disabled, prams ...) at the functional level,
including promoting the accessibility of offices and buildings
at staggered hours.

The PS proposes more specifically:


encourage, in rural areas, the installation of "home services
public "where different functions would be consolidated (reception desk
unique, for all federal public services, regional,
municipal and other public entities), as well as development,
in addition, mobile antennas, animated by officials

to evolve in an appropriate framework, have prospects

For the PS, priority should be given to statutory employment. To cope with
challenges of the future of public services in the framework of social dialogue, it
need to continue to upgrade the status, combining quality
service and respect for officials.
The challenge is to maintain the attractiveness of the public service as employer,
through innovative and exemplary management of human resources and
continuous improvement of well-being at work. Similarly, civil servants,
whether statutory or contractual, must enjoy real
career prospects.
A policy of promotion of talent within public services allows
autonomy and independence of the civil servant, to evolve a style
directive management style to a more participatory, more inclusive, where each
official works in confidence and enjoys the flexibility in
which it can flourish.
It is important to pay particular attention to the situation of
officials whose salaries are lowest.
To promote an attractive and rewarding public service, the PS offers
of:


continue to invest in the attractiveness of public services as
employer and an innovative management of human resources,



ensure that staffing levels of the public service of permits



strengthen strategic planning staff requirements in
better identifying flows and future needs, ensuring the transfer of

432

To achieve a better management of human resources within
public services, the PS proposes to:


ensure the regular organization of recruitment procedures
selecting and promoting continuing and enhancing their transparency,
impartiality, quality and speed, and review the system of
recruitment business to move towards a description of approach
function that allows a candidate who has the necessary skills
access to suitable position, beyond the sole criterion of the diploma by the

The public service must be a reflection of the society it serves, public employment
must be accessible to all: women, men, people of foreign origin or
not valid or disabled, young and older. It is necessary that
continue to promote diversity and equality between women and
men.
In this perspective, the PS proposes to:

promote diversity (disability, gender, age, origin, etc.)
within administrations, at all levels, by establishing
incentives and promote the fight against all forms of discrimination;



Wallonia-Brussels will propose to local authorities more tools to

In this regard, the PS proposes to strengthen the computerization of local authorities:

PLACE THE STRATEGIC PLAN CROSS THE HEART OF LOCAL MANAGEMENT

In the current fiscal environment, municipalities and provinces must always
reach do better with less financial means. To do this, it is
necessary that the Region and the federal state and the Federation WallonieBruxelles offer them the right tools to modern management, based on
a strategic approach in the medium term and an evaluation culture.
During the past Walloon regional legislature, proposed a pilot experiment
municipalities to decline, on a voluntary basis, their political program
General into a real strategic and operational approach, the
"Transverse Strategic Programme" (PST). It is to merge into a single
Document the different plans and programs that guide the action of a
mandature (policy statement, Agenda 21 declaration

MODERNISING LOCAL MANAGEMENT

With the increasing complexity of the tasks they perform and the services they
make citizens, it becomes necessary to adjust the mode of management
local authorities (municipalities, provinces, CPAS and intermunicipal
all paralocaux organizations) to make it more effective. There
Wallonia must in this respect play a driving role. Particular attention should
be given to large cities and small rural towns where
uniforms regional regulations that apply to the local authorities do
are not always adapted to the needs and specific missions.
PS proposes to:


promote a modern mode of internal administrative management, based
on the principles of cross-service and responsibility
Executive Committee in coordinating the implementation of decisions
policies and daily management of the administration;



strengthen the role of support and advice of Wallonia, whether in
legal, administrative, technical, financial, etc., ensuring
better inform local authorities on different legislation or
jurisprudence applicable to them;



develop handbook or "guide to good practice"
local management to accompany the local authorities in
modernize their management;



measure the impact of the implementation of any new legislation
big cities and small towns, to assess the
appropriateness to pursue a policy partially or completely
differentiated and adapted to their specificities.
437

Regarding inter involved in activities which the Region plays
the role of regulator and organizer of the eco-industry sector, or the
inter active in a competitive field (for example,
energy, telecommunications, hospitals, ...), we find that the legal model
intercommunal does not allow them to best fulfill the missions they
exercise. These require public enterprises sometimes more flexible management and
more responsive, sometimes supported by specialized managers and administrators
with specialized skills. Sometimes, and in view of their positioning
Strategic and changes in their respective jurisdictions, these
intercommunal more a matter of regional interest as the interest
purely local.
It is therefore necessary to change the legal framework to enable them
to assume their duties in the best interest of all citizens.
The PS proposes:

to change the legal structure of inter active in
some areas to a model more suited to the sector in which they
evolve, while ensuring the decisional transparency and control

PROMOTING GOOD USE OF MEANS AND SYNERGIES

Local authorities are the first public investors in the country. Every
year, there are hundreds of millions of euros that they invest in
the economy through the renovation of roads, building schools, nurseries
or sports or cultural facilities. Ultimately, there are thousands
non-relocatable jobs directly dependent on these investments.
Local authorities, however, are experiencing financial difficulties more
more acute. More so than in the past, it is essential that
federal and federated states are concerned about their status
they provide financial and strictly the principle of fiscal neutrality
their decisions.
The PS intends to relay the legitimate concerns of Commons. Strict
compliance with previous commitments, fair financing of their missions and
fair compensation decisions made at levels of power
are higher for PS three major principles that should guide
the actions of future governments.
To further ensure their role in country's economic growth and
ensure quality services to citizens, it is necessary to optimize
financial resources of local authorities by seeking savings
scale, developing and improving supracommunalité relations
financial with other levels of government.

438

In this respect, the proposed PS:


ensure budget neutrality for local authorities decisions
taken by other levels of government, by a financial evaluation
short and medium term financial impact prior to any decision,
a new charge of any compensation;


ensure compliance with current financial commitments in respect of
Local authorities, especially regarding the funding of Commons
the funds of the provinces and the Special Fund for Social Welfare;



maintain full coverage of the effects of the federal reforms
the unemployment related regulation and integration benefits, such
as provided by law;



encourage local authorities - according to their possibilities and after
feasibility study - to consolidate the support services of their Entities
paralocales (CPAS, police zones, etc.) into one service to
generate economies of scale, without affecting the volume of employment. The
services covered include the legal department, personnel,
computers, cash, jobs and public procurement;



develop supracommunalité order to pool, wide
towns, certain investments or services;



make available common (especially small ones) that

development of specifications, etc.);



simplify and ensure the legibility of local taxes by eliminating less
profitable, less relevant and those that require the load

equivalent;



strengthen the support and advisory role of the regional administration in
financial management (debt management, investment policy



expand the advisory role of the Region in the development of
European projects;



develop the central purchasing and stock markets usable by
local authorities;



continue at the regional level, the development of software for

and, locally, production support for computer products



improve the daily financial management of cults, whose powers

conclusion of an agreement between the cult and the local authority concerned

questions the freedom of worship.
The optimization of financial resources also means the right
financing of the missions entrusted to them by other levels of government,
better financial predictability for both revenue and expenditure and
the search for new funding sources.
In this context, particular attention must be paid to subsidies
granted to subordinate authorities. For the PS, the drawing right, through a
distribution of subsidies among municipalities based on objective criteria and
determined in advance, allows them to know over
multiyear the exact amount of the shell to which it is entitled. By
Moreover, it is based on the principle of administrative simplification: a single frame
Legal, simplified the process for granting the subsidy, a single authority
guardianship. Currently, this system created in the PS initiative exists solely to
the road works and buildings and its extension to all
grants (energy savings in buildings, housing, infrastructure
sporting, educational and cultural, etc.) is desirable.
To improve the predictability of the budgets of local authorities, the PS
proposes:


generalize, possibly supra-communal basis for some
subsidies, the drawing rights system through the creation of a fund
investment covering all the subsidies for the powers
local (municipalities, provinces and CPAS);



establish, together with the subsidies policy, a system
of "advances recoverable" for investment, allowing
the local entity to borrow less, and therefore to an economy on

O PTIMALISER THE ROLE OF PROVINCES ES

The Walloon regional legislature 2009-2014 allowed to initiate a wide
reform the provincial institution. Besides reducing the number of councilors
and MPPs and the introduction of new governance rules
in the functioning of the political bodies, the Walloon Government and
441

the provinces have reflected on the redevelopment of skills and
Provincial missions. Thus, certain skills such as housing or
roads could already be transferred to the region for the sake of consistency and
better service to citizens. Moreover, the provinces themselves have defined
the key policy axes they want to develop and identify
powers to be transferred to other levels of government.
There is currently a great homogeneity between domains
provincial intervention (education and training, health and social culture,
tourism, regional development and supracommunalité) but an intensity
different from the work they do in these respective powers. The PS
proposes, taking account of the specificities of these disparities and to continue
the redevelopment of provincial jurisdiction, province by province, in the
principles of coherence, subsidiarity, efficiency and value
added for citizens. This redevelopment will be done without negative impact
on staff currently based.
The supracommunalité can break down barriers between sectoral policies, create
coordination spaces of issues beyond the municipal boundaries and
to consider the development of common complementary manner and not
competitive. In this context, the PS believes that, as a power
Intermediate with democratic legitimacy, its own fiscal power and
of territorial administration, the provinces can participate in consistency
Project made from the territory of communities and facilitate the
realization thereof
Moreover, some municipalities can not only effectively fill
some missions or so at exorbitant costs. For logistical support,
Administrative and technical expertise, the provinces may organize with
municipalities, pooling certain services and will in
reduce operating costs, improve quality and simplify the
management
This is the case, for example, to the organization of fire departments. The
provinces already contribute to civil security of citizens, whether
directly, through for example the management of watercourse (prevention
floods) or the organization of fire schools, and by
via the Governors. The partnership between provinces and municipalities
in the management of relief zones constitute added value both in
concerns the provision of "know-how" in the provincial management structures
supra-that in order to allow economies of scale (sharing
tasks and qualified personnel) and simplifying the management of the area
Relief.
In this respect, the proposed PS:


continue the work begun in delivering on priorities
defined by each province in cooperation with Wallonia and
Wallonia-Brussels Federation; axes which must be broken down in a
transversal strategic plan missions and objectives defined by
territorial specificities, socio-economic realities and needs
of users in each province;
442



implement the approach, province by province as to transfer
skills that could be better managed by other levels
power, to improve service to citizens and respect of
principles of subsidiarity, continuity of public service and no impact
negative about the staff in place and negotiate the transfer arrangements
skills with Wallonia-Brussels or Wallonia Federation;



to reflect with Wallonia and the Wallonia-Brussels
about the possibility of delegating certain tasks by contracting
and skills to provinces and supra-municipal bodies in
a logic of subsidiarity, coherence and effectiveness of policies to
benefit of citizens, accompanying any authorization of
adequate funding;



strengthening partnerships with municipalities to allow these
last meet the needs of citizens by organizing
some missions they can not only make their dependents;



develop provincial and unifying role of operator in the
development
from
projects
supracommunaux
and
from
dialogue
supra-;



allow provinces to be full partners of
common in the management of fire services either through a
additional funding relief areas based on criteria
established in consultation with the municipalities or by the delegation of any
or some of the administrative and financial management tasks by area
Relief to the province, this in the context of support to provinces
supracommunalité initiatives.

The province / city partnership may bring on limited missions
management (eg, procurement, legal services, management
accounting), but also jump to transfer all of the management of the area of
aid to the province with the agreement of members of the common area
Relief. The additional provincial funding support would come from
the joint according to criteria previously set therewith on
basis of the needs of the spare area.

D EVELOPING THE SUPRACO MMUNAL ITE

The supracommunalité and living areas have now become issues
Major Development of Wallonia. Some do not have elsewhere
awaited the signal for the region and created local initiatives to organize
places of consultation, develop and implement territorial strategies
joint projects. This movement expresses a desire or a need:
manage the common public interests in a complementary manner and not
competitive, closer to the interests of citizens at a territorial level
corresponding to a relevant catchment area, that is to say to a territorial area
where citizens usually have their principal activities.
If supracommunalité is already organized for very specific sectors
including through inter-municipal (waste, gas distribution and
electricity, hospitals, etc.), supracommunalité understood as a
443

reflection and action on the global land and its development
economic, social, cultural, environmental, etc. has emerged in recent
years in different ways, spontaneous, voluntary and outside any legal framework.
Yet the challenges the supracommunalité and politics basins
Life can provide a response are fundamental:
 limitation of budgetary resources forces us to think the
investments at a scale of a catchment area and to organize themselves
achieve economies of scale by pooling resources and
sharing costs;
 environmental and energy issues, and the costs they
generate, can not be answered only through a
spatial planning for densification through struggle
against urban sprawl, preserving rurality and policy
rational mobility;
 the fight against socio-economic inequalities also requires
Land use policy that goes beyond the limits of
only common because laissez-faire in this area generates a
dualisation of functions and a concentration of citizens to profile
Social identical in the same places;
 Wallonia will succeed the challenge of economic development and
the attractiveness of its territory if it is organized so
thoughtful, planned, non-competitive and encouraging
recognition of metropolises, that is to say the big cities and their
agglomeration, as defined in the development plan
the regional area (SDER).
The PS advocates the widespread supracommunalité as tool
good governance throughout Wallonia, a necessary condition
harmonious, rational and mastered territory for the benefit of
all its inhabitants.
In the light of experience in the field that have emerged in recent years, fruit
good understanding of local actors, it now appears necessary
encourage the development of supracommunalité throughout the
Walloon region by the establishment of financial incentives and mentor
existing and future initiatives to ensure a coherent territorial policy
and not competitive. To this end, the possibility of delegating powers in
territorial development of the municipality to the organ
supra-whose decisions would be required then to all municipalities
adherent, will be scheduled.
A reflection on the possibility of delegating by certain contracting
duties and powers exercised by Wallonia and the Federation to supracommunaux WallonieBruxelles organs will also be conducted.
The PS also proposes to encourage the organization of supracommunalité in
reserving certain regional grants to supra-initiatives -
granted based on a drawing right - by raising and other subsidies
depending on whether the projects introduced by a community or territories
by a common one.

444

To be eligible for these grants, the territorial community will:


develop a strategic plan of development - social, economic,
cultural, environmental - of its territory on the basis of an analysis
depth strengths, weaknesses and needs of the territory. This
analysis will combine forces. Particular attention will be
given to issues of business development, to
mobility, spatial planning and major infrastructure
public;



incorporate at least one capital of administrative district order
ensure the inclusion in the thinking of the organization of
services and burdens inherent in a central city. The
territorial communities can transcend borders
Provincial;



have a consultative body (eg, a Conference of
mayors), or making, and benefit from sustainable funding
minimum for the implementation of its projects from a
provincial participation and / or participation of Commons based
on the principles of equity and territorial solidarity.

For the PS, organize supracommunalité can in no way mean adding
a level of power. It is only optimize the performance of
skills by encouraging municipalities to work together on
spatial planning and services and implement projects
Common whose interests go beyond the municipal boundaries.

445

PREVENTION AND SAFETY
Guarantee every citizen to live in security is a prerequisite
to improve the quality of life and to strengthen social cohesion.
For the PS, it is fundamental to adopt in relation to security issues
an approach that is neither catastrophic nor angelic. Any act of aggression or
incivility must be effectively sanctioned with caution under penalty of
see developed impunity. The first victims are usually
People in fragile situations.
Safety is also a matter of social justice to which we must
provide concrete answers. We must address security issues
working on the restoration of social ties, on prevention mechanisms,
the preservation of public space, on policing and on
adequate enforcement measures.
Ensuring the safety of people and goods is one of the basic missions
authorities. If this area is traditionally the police and spring
of Justice, the regions and communities should also contribute to the
safety. Indeed, problems related to insecurity and feelings
insecurity should be considered closely correlated with political
strengthened and ambitious social cohesion, employment, integration and
education.
Security is everybody's business: a global, transversal approach is
necessary in this perspective; the Federal State and the federated entities
consult among themselves and with all the actors within the meaning of security
offshore, in matters within their respective competences - for
determine priorities and actions on safety and prevention. This is
also through this that we can offer our young people a positive alternative to
radicalization and violent extremism.
It is also important to improve collaboration between local authorities and
justice in the criminal justice system, in particular to avoid recurrence and better
support victims.
Control of security services, their operation and their
survey methods is an essential requirement in order to strengthen democratic
legitimate expectations vis-à-vis citizens of the State. And therefore, improve, there
where still necessary, rules, mechanisms and independent bodies
who are responsible.
The town remains the level closest to the citizen. For the PS, so it is
important to maintain the role of the local authority in the organization of
prevention and safety policies and improve mechanisms
information, consultation and cooperation of local authorities. These
should be supported in this context.

446

1. TRENGTHENING PROXIMITY POLICE AND BETTER SUPPORT
POLICE ON THE GROUND

For the PS, the role of community policing is essential for service
public to the population, prevention and repression of crime .. In
Accordingly, community policing is not just one approach
proactive, but also a search for alternative arrangements for the
dealing with conflicts and the fight against crime.
The police general quality work. However, some
elements are still improving both the local police and the police
Federal order to better meet the real concerns of citizens and
preserve their trust with the police and the authorities. For example,
structurally, the proximity function is inadequately
account and it is therefore necessary to reorganize some police body
decentralizing their workforce to the maximum benefit of neighborhoods.
Furthermore, it is deplorable that the police zones are confronted with heavy
administrative burden (eg with the police investigation ex officio)
execution of footnotes and executing judicial duties which they do
not control the volume, and that too often are not subject rankings
after.
In addition, local police saw grow its federal character missions, for
example, the transfer of prisoners, assistance in investigations under
widespread, serious disturbances of public order, the transfer of prisoners
supervision of embassies or detainees during strikes in prisons ...
The priority is to strengthen local police, under the effective authority of the authorities
local. In this regard, it is necessary to better involve local authorities
in the management of the integrated police, particularly in the negotiations
social and organizational.
Balanced funding of local police remains our priority and the
simplification of the organization and functioning of the police to
allow police to focus more on priorities such as
redefined by the authorities. It should support all possibilities
creation of administrative synergies (department of public procurement, logistics,
equipment maintenance ...) to release the means that would be used to
strengthen police presence in the streets.
Moreover, it will be necessary to further clarify the role of all
actors, public and private security to improve partnerships
respect for the primacy of the role of the police and a strengthened control
security firms and private investigators.
Moreover, the transfer of certain powers to the Regions for the
security (concerning mobility, for example) will have impacts on missions
but also the support capability of finding or verbalizing
police. This will require better cooperation between the Regions,
the federal state, justice and the police, for example, in setting
447

implementation of the reform of the judicial landscape or creating communities
countries or living areas.
Security trades are a source of jobs should not be overlooked,
especially for low-skilled youth. In this perspective, it should be
develop a true system of training in this sector. The objective is to
build bridges between different trades of security.
In this context, the PS proposes to:


strengthen police rooted in the local community, its presence
prevention in neighborhoods, police patrols on the ground and
the effectiveness of interventions and urgent appeals by relieving them
police administrative tasks and ensuring the promotion
a policy against discrimination and prejudice,
including during identity checks;



improve federal police zones funding mechanisms
local and federal police to further improve the service
population and ensure a fair financing of the police zones;



pending the revision of the KUL standard, update the data
statistics used in the calculation of the standard eg
better reflect population growth and impoverishment;



provide an impact test of each policy action and decision adopted
by higher authorities (Federal State, Regions and justice), a
hand
in
terms
from
loads
Financial
and
administrative
Additional on local authorities and, secondly, on safety
and the feeling of insecurity;



make more adequate distribution of tasks between the federal police and
local police but also between the general police,
justice and other public services;



encourage synergies, collaborations and partnerships, as well as
the agreement of local authorities, voluntary mergers of police zones,
to benefit from an even more effective and more efficient service;



encourage the federal police to respond even more targeted
to requests for support of local police districts to reflect
the realities of the local terrain (management support, reinforcement in case of complaints
and large events, recruitment, training, logistical support) and,
within this framework, pay special attention to improving the
scientific and technical police.

Regarding the management of police human resources, the PS offers
of:


continue in consultation with local authorities and organizations
union efforts to improve and optimize the
human resources management within the police,
including:
o

promoting recruitment more in line with local realities
and enhancing training focused on proximity, diversity,
448

interculturalism and ethics;
o

encouraging management more suited to careers
needs, for example by upgrading the inspector function
neighborhood and their working conditions;

o

upgrading the status by combining quality of service and
respect for police and CALOG (administrative frameworks and
logistics);



promote the function of inspectors and police officers by
communication campaigns and optimize pre-training
the selection tests;



promote integrated training courses for police, firefighters,
the peacekeepers and other trades and prevention
promote participation in the seventh year of teaching
technical "business security" and training bridges
facilitate access to the police function for peacekeepers who
wish.

Regarding partnerships between different public authorities, the PS
proposes:


strengthen consultations between the federal, regional and
Local police matters, including strengthening and
extending the role of the Advisory Council of Mayors, in close
consultation with unions of cities and towns and the Commission
permanent local police;



association of local authorities as employers in negotiations
social for better cost control;



set up with the Governments of Regions, a cell
administrative and regional technique to facilitate consultation
between the regions and the police.

The PS also proposes to:


continue to invest in the fight against terrorism, radicalism
violent scope, serious organized crime and social fraud,
fiscal and economic;



continue efforts to improve the functioning and
coordination of intelligence services and the transparency of
police information in respect of the protection of privacy;



accelerate the implementation of cyber security strategy through
Belgian center recently created cyber security, because security is
also the protection of privacy, our economic interests and
the state apparatus;



strengthen at international level, as part of crime
Cross-border police cooperation between states
the European Union, with particular attention to prevention;
449



establish a national platform bringing together the government, the
private sector and consumers to combat networks
Counterfeiting and piracy, and to work for the procedures and
the regulations at European and national level are better
coordinated to ensure effective action on the ground.

2. D YNAMISER UES PolitiQ THE PREVENTION AND HOUSEHOLD
PUBLISHED THE PLACES CS PO UR URS S MAKE THEM MORE

Security must contribute to strengthening social cohesion. For this, it is
necessary to support the development of prevention projects, techno-, accompanying victims and alternative dispute
conflict resolution including mediation services.
Moreover, urban development, such as squares, streets, parks,
have a wide influence on the perception we have of our own
security. It is therefore essential to pursue investments that make
public places friendlier and therefore safer.
The reappropriation of public space as a social function which must be
guaranteed by public authorities. For example, regional policy should aim
to support municipalities to develop conviparlité spaces, preserve
hospitality venues and promote citizen participation devices
to allow greater involvement of people in their own
security. This means ensuring, in the respect for rights and freedoms,
repair damage to public space, and to service it regularly
to develop an adequate street lighting.
Whether in the field of urban planning, public lighting, furniture
urban, design and management of public utilities and
public spaces, it should consider the potential impacts on
security. To counter the feeling of insecurity, should be incorporated in
all public policies, a "prevention and safety" reflex.
Furthermore, special attention must be paid to safety in
transport and, in this context, should be better supported them
investments guaranteeing an improvement in security.
The strategic plans of security and prevention, as well as political
Federal and regional big cities, helped financially support
local authorities so they can develop projects that contribute to
reduce insecurity and the feeling it engenders and, consequently,
improve the "living together".
During recent years, prevention policies developed by
Regions have moved towards an approach increasingly cross, perennial
and focused on social cohesion, social development of neighborhoods and access
Fundamental rights for all. This approach allowed the powers
strengthen local field collaborations with all stakeholders
prevention and security at all levels of government.

450

In addition, the PS has always considered that it was necessary to give a true place to
victim and therefore continue to invest in assistance to frontline
victims provided by the local police and to encourage all
public actors (and voluntary) concerned to work together.
Finally, faced with everyday problems, neighborhood and family conflicts that
generators can be precarious, it is essential to develop other
replies that the only judicial or police responses: for example,
promote neighborhood mediation to resolve small disputes outside the frame
judiciary.
In this context, the PS proposes to:
 strengthen the decentralization of public services in neighborhoods and
in villages, particularly through the development experiences
district antennas, neighborhood police stations to town halls
district, village houses or participatory projects
(advisory councils or neighborhood committees);


promote
development
urban
and
rural
from
fashion
secure (street lighting, securing around schools, easy access
emergency services ...) and encourage the realization of diagnostics
Security premises;



to finance long-term strategic plans and security
existing in coordination with regional prevention policies
social cohesion and redevelopment of neighborhoods;



supracommunaux develop prevention projects for
management prostitution, urban gangs prevention
criminogenic, management of alternative judicial measurements,
Mediation in the context of municipal administrative sanctions, of
substance abuse prevention ...;



improve front-line police assistance to victims to the
assist in their efforts quickly and effectively manage
of their case;



build bridges and permanent consultations between fonts
Local responsible for the first line of assistance to victims and aid
Social litigants (parquet, justice, authorized specialist services
federated entities) in order to ensure continuity in the management of
victims ;



in encouraging municipalities and groups of municipalities, the
neighborhood mediators creation that mission will be to solve,
through dialogue, negotiation and agreement of all parties
concerned, the nature of small civil disputes such as conflict
neighborhoods, small conflicts between tenants and landlords, small
joint ownership conflicts ...;



continue supporting businesses related to social cohesion,
Prevention and safety in public (the guardians of
Peace, street educators, mediators, facilitators ...), and
encourage professionalization (including through a
451

better training and coaching) and their inclusion in the
municipal civil service;


techno-support equipment in private homes and
promoting other preventive measures, for example, by making
available to citizens of a techno-advisor or
the district inspector who give free advice to
prevent theft and fires in homes and businesses.

3. NSURING THE LIVING - TOGETHER BY A TION OF APP LI
SANCTIONS
MEDIATION

ADMINISTRA TIVE

COMMUNAL

AND

THERE

All antisocial behavior and nuisance resulting (tags, deposits
illegal waste, damage to public facilities, sound uproars ...)
should be promptly identified and prosecuted, including an application
effective municipal administrative sanctions (SAC). For the PS, the implementation
implement SAC must be part of a communal policy of prevention,
preservation of public space, and social cohesion.
With the system of municipal administrative sanctions and mediation,
municipalities are able to deal more quickly and efficiently
against incivility and disrespectful behavior. These are
often at the root of insecurity and degradation links
social and community life. For that, for the PS, it is essential to continue
to support municipalities in the implementation of administrative sanctions
communal, mediation and commitment of peacekeepers.
If administrative penalties have shown interest, the municipality must
however, become an authority which overcomes the systematic work of the
justice. The Criminal Code can not continue to be unraveled, leaving the
common care to prosecute offenses that are not willing or floors
can no longer continue.
The application of SAC raises the question of the relationship between the police and
constatateurs agents. The police must continue to observe the sanctions
the most serious administrative. It should not refer this observation on
only peacekeepers or other constatateurs. To facilitate the work of
police, harmonization of municipal police regulations must
also be encouraged.
For the PS, the application of the SAC to minors must remain a mere option while
favoring an educational approach to sanctions through mediation and
the application of citizen services. PS recommended that mayors
Socialists and municipal representatives not to lower the age at
next change in their police regulations to conform to
mandatory provisions of the new law. Where appropriate, if a common
SAC decides to apply to minors,
it will then be necessary to proceed
prior to consultation with youth organizations, police,
judicial authorities and prevention organizations to assess the relevance
the application of this measure.

452

During recent years, particularly the prevention of trades
Peacekeepers have changed enormously. New tasks (Information
public security of public spaces, and now finding under
SAC ...) entrusted to peacekeepers without in any way strengthen their
status (low wages, shift schedule, sometimes at night, outdoor and
risk situation) nor their funding.
In addition, many municipalities have seen settling shops and
night clubs of all kinds who took advantage of loopholes in the law of 10
November 2006 on opening hours in commerce, crafts and
services, for example, "night-shop" becoming "tobacco shop".
The operation of these businesses causes disturbances of public order and
public tranquility, such as noise, waste, drunkenness in public places, etc.
In this context, the PS proposes to:


strengthen the fight against anti-social behavior by supporting municipalities in the
effective implementation of the various sanctions devices
administrative and encourage unification of regulations
Police and decisions between municipalities of the same police zone in
for efficiency and administrative simplification;



ensuring respect for rights and freedoms in the drafting and implementation
implement administrative police regulations, among other,
favoring mediation to sanctions;



encourage federal and regional authorities to better support
Commons to strengthen the presence of peacekeepers on the
ground for the recognition of antisocial behavior;



promote good complementarity between different devices
federal and regional administrative sanctions;



develop an awareness policy and supervision of actors
premises so they increase the offer of mediation and measures
as restorative sanction of nuisances caused that allow
managers to be aware of the nuisance they
cause;



provide training on the application of the SAC in
Commons;



support partnerships between municipalities and police areas
the recognition of antisocial behavior and enforcement of the SAC, by
eg the setting up of "cells SAC" in the local police;



systematically favor the application of mediation and
and encourage civic services tailored information and
prior consultation with youth associations so common
decides to apply the SAC to minors;



an assessment of the implementation of the new Law on
municipal administrative sanctions, especially in
for minors, in partnership with local authorities, justice,
police and youth associations.
453

To prevent the installation of shops and nightclubs in places
clearly inappropriate and better prevent the nuisance they cause,
PS proposes to:


strengthen federal legislation to require authorization
Communal installing some shops and nightclubs;



encouraging coordinated action between police and
various federal and regional inspectorates (Inland Revenue, Vat, Social Legislation,
Labour, AFSCA, Road transport, ...), as well as strengthen cooperation
border in order to fight more effectively against fraud and
various forms of trafficking.

4. P OURSUIVRE THE IMPROVEMENT OF CIVIL S ECURITY
For the PS, the continued implementation of the right of every citizen to
the fastest and most appropriate emergency is a priority. Operation
optimal emergency services and urgent medical care must be provided
to better protect citizens, its property and based on environment
the needs of the field.
In this context, particular attention should be paid to improving
emergency calls throughout the territory, in particular, by the
realization of the establishment of the single emergency number 112,
optimization of provincial dispatching centers and consolidation of
Astrid telecommunication network.
Prevention about the risk of fire and accidents must be strengthened as
in terms of monitoring of various emergency plans and response than that of
awareness of the population to respect the safety instructions. He
should also develop skills in the management of
crises.
Working conditions and fire training will be enhanced to
they are better adapted to the needs and risks of the profession. The
role of volunteer firefighter must be valued in our society as
citizen engagement. In this respect, the trades of civil security is a
source of jobs, especially for young people. In this perspective, it should
to develop a real system of training in this sector and
promote trade firefighter, paramedic and rescuer.
On the basis of a reasonable timetable drawn up in consultation with the
organizations representing firefighters and local authorities, the
Federal Government will continue the implementation of measures necessary for the
Reform of civil security, including the implementation of the new statute.
The municipalities and the Brussels-Capital Region that organizes service
fire and emergency medical aid (SIAMU) should be better supported
within this framework. In this respect for the PS, the budget neutrality of the reform
civil security must be guaranteed for both common and any decision to
the federal authority will be subject to an impact assessment in terms of expenses
finance and administration for local authorities and for the Region
Brussels.
454

To improve the organization and functioning of civil security,
ensure the quality of services rendered to the population and respect for autonomy
local, optimizing available resources will be sought by developing
partnerships, cooperation and synergies, notably with the
civil protection.
Finally, it is important to support the continuation of our European commitments and
International during disasters and emergencies abroad and,
in this context, implement and update coherent instruments
disaster prevention and mutual risk information.
For protection "fire" optimal, the PS proposes to:


improve basic education, continuing training and
training firefighters, which involves strengthening
infrastructure (fire schools), including techniques for
Special and improve overall supply of training, as well as
ensure better counseling after
difficult interventions;



prepare as many young people training to firefighters
enhance the source of jobs that are trades
civil security, including the creation and where it already exists,
by the support and recognition, a school of young fire brigade in each province and in the Brussels-Capital Region
whose formation will be recognized, as well as through the promotion of courses
education and vocational training "trades
civil security " ;



conduct regular prevention campaigns (for example,
awareness campaigns and first aid care,
techno-support ...) and ensure the update plans
municipal and provincial emergency and intervention (and PGCUI
PGPCUI);



strengthen the modernization of equipment and infrastructure in order
improve the quality of aid and the conditions of labor
staff ;



create additional funding for fire services by
insurance companies without financial implications for
insured;



continuing coverage throughout Belgium by
Civil protection, in particular via the antenna for Gembloux
provinces of Brabant Wallon and Namur;



promote and develop partnerships, cooperation, synergies
or voluntary mergers between existing emergency zones between
relief areas and other public authorities or services;



improve synergies and collaborations between civil protection and
fire departments and the Brussels-Capital Region in SIAMU for a better articulation of the organization
Emergency Relief and continuous improvement of their quality as
455

in Belgium and abroad;


allow provinces to be full partners of
common in the management of fire services either through
additional financing relief areas on base
criteria in consultation with the municipalities or by the
delegation of all or some of the management tasks
administrative and financial aid through the area to the province,
the
framework
from
support
of
provinces
the
initiatives
from
supracommunalité.

To further improve emergency medical care and general medical care,
PS proposes to:


optimize the management of emergency calls (100-112), including
increasing the rate of knowledge of the number 112, a
better training for employees and their supervision by nurses
doctors and detached from the emergency services, by improving
efforts to allow better localization of calls
emergency from mobile phones, and accelerate the
implementation of the Centre 112 in Brabant Wallon;



further reform of ambulance services to increase 100
their performance, including better organization
hotlines
and
a
better
training
of
secouristesambulanciers;



generalize the unique national call number (1733) to the cover
general medicine, promote the creation of new guard posts
general medicine to cover the entire territory of the country
end of 2016 and secure the movement of GPs.

456

JUSTICE
The last Parliament was devoted to the adoption of important reforms
in the legal world: the reform of the judicial district of BruxellesHal-Vilvoorde, reform of the judicial landscape, reform of the State Council, a
new management model. But during the same period and for several
years, individuals have too often been neglected. Justice and its actors
must be understandable for citizens. Confidence must be restored
between the judiciary and the public. Access to justice must be defended,
particularly for the poorest citizens and public benefit
a modest income.
The penalties have to make sense for the victims and for the people
convicted. The reintegration of ex-prisoners should be a priority.
Finally, monitoring of reforms in judicial organization, but
also the status of judges, respect for their independence, their training
continues, and the rationalization of existing institutions are all
points of attention for the PS.

JUSTICE

COM graspable

AND

SIGN sible

FINANCIALLY

Access to justice is not limited to organize legal aid offices. He
must also ensure that all citizens have the financial capacity to
to assert their rights. Today, too many citizens are excluded from
any access to justice because they exceed the income thresholds set under
legal aid. A citizen who has modest incomes must
consider serenely wearing a dispute before a judge without the scale
spending make him give up his desire for justice. The
various costs of a trial, apportioned between the fees of the lawyer fees
bailiff, translation, expertise must be mastered so that justice
remains accessible.
Lawyers who provide records relating to legal aid provide
real public service to the attention of the poor. Yet valuing
Legal Aid has decreased in recent years so that legal aid
proposed to the poor often becomes the exclusive competence of the lawyers
less seasoned (trainees) or involves a militant act. To guarantee
effective access for all citizens regardless of their income, to a
quality of justice in defense, the PS proposes to the revaluation of aid
legal priority in the budget for justice.
The technical language used in the pleadings and judgments
is also a major obstacle to the exercise of this fundamental right. If this
tech is often necessary due to the precision requirements
material, judges should nonetheless ensure that this does technicality
make the procedure and the decisions adopted fully
incomprehensible to the eyes of the litigant. Similarly, it is
fundamental that sentences in criminal matters are understood in
litigants concerned. Fines and compensation amounts
457

may be presented in the form of basic amounts multiplied by
surcharges.
The PS proposes several measures to facilitate access to justice and will alleviate
ultimately the cost of recourse to justice for litigants:


continue the fight against the backlog in implementing the
measures decided as part of the reform of the judicial landscape;



improve the quality of legal assistance and if necessary take
corrective measures to ensure better access to justice
the poorest groups;


defend the revaluation of the value of the point as a priority in the
Budget of justice;



examine ways to alleviate the cost of VAT on fees
law against citizens who are not subject distinguishing
litigation proceedings simple legal consultations and
exempting alternative dispute resolutions (ADR);



promote the use of alternative means of dispute resolution such
the active conciliation or mediation, reducing costs
procedures when mediation or other ADR was
attempted before the litigation stage;



generalize as much as possible the introduction of business by request
(communicated to the prosecution cases, family cases, cases under
the competence of justice) rather than quote, which is a
more expensive method of filing;



generalize the communication mode of pleadings by
notification (where appropriate electronic) instead of the service by
bailiff to decrease the costs of the proceedings;



reduce legal costs borne by litigants (charges
translation of expertise, meaning and enforcement of judgments) by
especially motivating example the need to expose certain fees and
certain duties;



encourage collaboration between the courts and the bars for
an implementation of permanence in the mediation material
Civil and commercial;



included in the mandatory training of judges and clerks, a
Learning a language understandable acts
procedures and the mastery of costs;



encourage the prosecution to make the pleadings such as
citations or indictments understandably for
litigants concerned and, in this context, to consider consultations
between the Minister of Justice and the Board of Prosecutors General to
Parquet of widespread awareness of this issue;



encourage judges to use the judgments models
developed by the Association of Magistrates (ASM) allowing
justiciable easy understanding of decisions to them
458

addressed;


encourage judges to actually formulating judgments
accessible to litigants eliminating archaic formulas and
improving the structure of judgments;



judges impose a formulation of the amounts of fines
including the surcharges and to know
immediately the exact amount of the fine;



disseminate widely the existence and powers of the Committee
responsible for assessing legislative follow federal law and to improve
quality;



Register in the Code of Criminal Procedure the principle of
free communication of the judgment to the parties and to ensure in practice
the free shipping judgments, primarily electronically.

2. P GET INTO ACCOUNT THE VICTIMS AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE
The PS is sensitive to the plight of criminal victims and their families. The heaviness
certain processing procedures and the time creating too often within
unreasonable that may have the effect of delaying all repairs
the damage suffered bereavement or sometimes entire families. The victims, as
full citizens but also as participants in the proceedings, must
receive special attention.
To ensure better integration of victims, the PS proposes to:


Victims book a place in the Assize Court before the public,
along with their lawyer, to recognize their existence and their
allow to contact their lawyer during the hearings;



educate aid services to victims in some situations very
involving a sensitive child deaths and ensure that parents
receive special coaching at the material but
also in the days and weeks, to ensure that
parents are psychologically available to seize the
proposed aid;



ensure the correct application of the law of 15 December 2013 which provides
that victims are informed of decisions taken by the court
sentence enforcement or juvenile court (where the author is
minor) which involves partial or total restoration freedom of the author,
in the shortest possible time so that, where appropriate,
adapt their behavior and avoid being in a situation of
physical confrontation with former detainee;



examine the possibility of designating a contact person contact
for the victims, with victim assistance competent to
assist early in the dossier to the execution of the measures
sentence.

Furthermore, the "Master Plan prisons" great plan conducted in the last
Legislature by the Government to modernize existing prisons and build
459

new prisons, it is imperative to add to this
a prisoners' reintegration strategy so that in the company's interest
as held and the budget for justice, deprivation of
Freedom can achieve genuine reintegration of former convicts.
For it to be meaningful, deprivation of liberty must be thinking in a logical
rehabilitation. It is not desirable that persons sentenced to
imprisonment find themselves in detention, left to their own fate,
without any work preparing for their rehabilitation. We need that imprisonment path
the detainee evolve, day after day, training after training, to a state
different spirit from the one in which he came into custody.
In parallel, especially given the overcrowding of prisons and state
the cost of detention, it is imperative to think of other penalties
including imprisonment for a short sentence, ineffective
punishment of another reason. For instead of giving meaning to the sentence, a
imprisonment for a short time, causes more damage it causes
profits. It desocialized the convicted person and sometimes plunges into a
more criminogenic environment. If the prison does not seem suitable for
short periods, however, it is imperative that penalties are applied
so that justice makes sense, as the eyes of victims, offenders,
police, the judiciary as other actors in society.
The deprivation of liberty ordered as part of a preventive detention, that is to say before judgment, should help preserve security in the first place
Physical citizens. In order not to aggravate the overcrowding, the
use of preventive detention must be carefully thought out and not become
systematic or a means of pressure to obtain confessions. In the absence
absolutely necessary for public safety, preventive detention must be
avoided. When the State must ensure that the alleged facts
does not escape justice, other measures may be ordered, as
the use of electronic bracelets for example.
In some disputes, the use of deprivation of liberty is a real failure. He
is the case in terms of drug use. Cases relating to
litigation contribute significantly to overcrowding,
especially as preventive detention is widely used there, without
so that a conviction systematically intervene later in the
part of a judgment. Criminal policy must be changed pource Type
infringement.
The internment of mental patients in psychiatric annexes to prisons
for a long time without treatment is the subject of many
justified criticism. Belgium has been a new and sad
condemnation by the European Court of Human Rights in January 2013 on
the deplorable situation of psychiatric annexes to prisons, the lack
shouting care tailored to the detainees and the structural shortage of places in
adapted care structures. It should be remedied.
In criminal justice, the PS proposes to:


expand the possibilities for attendance by minutes to bring
460

as quickly as possible to answer certain facts;


extend the possibilities of mediation in criminal cases beyond what the code
Criminal Investigation is now and allow the Procuratorate
also propose to the facts that call for more condemnation
a significant term of imprisonment exceeding two years, subject
compliance with current conditions and compensation for the victim or
repair the damage suffered;



assess the frontline hotlines system organized within
the Brussels public prosecutor and consider the value to generalize to
reduce the length of proceedings (this allows permanently in Brussels
accelerate the appearance of the accused, which has a clear advantage
in terms of cost and procedural deadline), the number of cases brought
sometimes unnecessarily to education and implement better
consistent decisions in floors;



focus preventive detention on its original purpose and to impose
Magistrate specifically and individually motivate its decision on this
developed particularly in cases of maintenance of preventive detention for
a particularly long and sometimes still distant duration of the trial;



limit the issuance of arrest warrants to cases in which one
finds an absolute necessity for public safety, while
allowing the investigating judge in other cases, to impose
alternative measures such as the use of electronic tagging or
GPS electronic monitoring when there is no fear that
evidence disappear;



allow the accused to plead guilty in a preliminary phase
trial before the council chamber in the presence of his lawyer, to
benefit from a simplified procedure and a reduced sentence while
requiring further approval by headquarters magistrate;



examine
the opportunity
to establish
a
system
proportional to the income of the convicted person;



restore meaning to detention by effectively implementing the "Plan
detention "of the Dupont law so that each day of deprivation
Freedom is part of a global project that places the detainee at the center of his
future reintegration;



implement a coherent policy to short sentences
to impose penalties that can be executed materially
given the overcrowding and the effect of desocializing
deprivation of liberty;



develop alternatives to imprisonment, particularly for
prison sentences of less than six months, as the work
of general interest, fines, training, probation;



examine the possibility of putting an end to the deprivation of liberty
narcotics consumer affairs, where the use of detention
Preventive increased significantly without this being followed
systematically to a conviction or an accompaniment to
fight against addictions, and impose alternative penalties to

fines

461

detention as a fine, probation, community service,
etc. ;


provide alternatives to detention of the mentally ill
in unsuitable places and for an indefinite period and implement
up a real support for the detainees in places with
care and support tailored to their needs;



organize training in forensic psychiatry to address the
severe lack of professionals who can be consulted and involved
in internment decisions;



develop an integrated approach involving all levels of power
for the treatment of internees, their monitoring and
support during their internment and in case of release;



ensure better collaboration between the houses of justice and
justiciable support services by setting up a coordination
combining administrative management of the two sectors in compliance
their functional characteristics;



review legislation on criminal evidence given the
Recent case law of the Court of Cassation and lay down precise rules
allowing in particular to know under what conditions a proof
brought in criminal matters is admissible.

Regarding the detention and prison officers, the PS proposes to:


improve the status of detainees and implement all of the law
of 12 January 2005 which aims to recognize them certain rights
fundamental about the physical living conditions in detention or
health;



including putting in place an effective complaint system held
and independent;



ensure access to health for all prisoners;



resolve the intolerable situation of detainees in the annexes
Psychiatric prisons by creating additional spaces in
social protection establishments to allow a transfer in
promptly adapted to these places and ensuring adequate monitoring of
inmates in psychiatric annexes to prisons;



launch a broad debate on the prison officer profession faces
difficulties and considerable pressure, and adopt measures
concrete to avoid strikes and respond to absenteeism
in the profession;



adapt the training of prison officials to allow them to
the tools needed to manage conflict and to the
physical or verbal abuse;



ease and speed erasure rules and Rehabilitation
criminal convictions to facilitate the reintegration of persons who
have served their sentence and who do not represent a danger to
company ;
462



objectify the issue of criminal records on the basis of
Netherlands system, that is to say, by entrusting a specialized body
examining the relevance of the use of employers' demands
relating to the criminal record of candidates for employment.

3. O UTILLER ORGANIZATION Judicia IRE
Reform of the judicial landscape causes an upheaval in the field.
The independence of the judiciary is a cornerstone of our democratic society.
The reforms undertaken by the Minister of Justice can not to interfere
any way the independence of judges. The PS will be extremely
vigilant about the respect that independence.
Furthermore, the training of judges and trainees must be improved to

given the technical nature of the issues they have to deal.
Finally, to ensure a better functioning of the judiciary, the
replacing judges who leave a vacancy must be accelerated. He
The same applies as regards the vacancies for staff

DEFENCE
In this year of commemoration of the centenary of the War 14-18, context
world shows that peace and stability remain fragile. The crises that
or that last erupted recently in the Sahel, in the Great Lakes region or
even in the Middle East are examples that illustrate the multiplication
hotbeds of tension and diversification of threats to peace and
stability.

B UILDING E N A WORLD PEACE AND SECURIT E

For the PS, the use of force must always be the last option
and thus can not be made once all diplomatic means exhausted,
in accordance with international law.
To strengthen international legitimacy, legality and transparency
military operations, the PS proposes to:


internationally, register all military operations in the
under a UN mandate;



nationally, prior notice and without delay Parliament of
any commitment or amendment of commitment
Belgium in a military operation, and associate it with its monitoring,
including through the Parliamentary Commission for monitoring of operations
military.

PS shares the vision of a world without nuclear weapons. PS Thanks to the
Belgium has always been at the forefront of the global fight against weapons say
"Dirty" (landmines, cluster bombs, uranium munitions
depleted and those disseminating ionizing radiation or weapons
chemical).
To ensure that nuclear disarmament is balanced, reduced
nuclear arsenals can not be the result of multilateral negotiations
which Belgium continue to participate actively.
To continue the fighting, the PS proposes that Belgium will:


resolute action in favor of international initiatives for
further disarmament and the prohibition of the production,
financing and the use of effects weapon systems
indiscriminate and / or disproportionately, cause
civilian casualties, such as, for example, ammunition
white phosphorus;



make its active contribution to ensure the respect of the Treaty of nuclear non-proliferation and prohibit the presence of nuclear weapons on

At a time when hotbeds of tension are increasing in its near

For the PS, Belgium must continue and strengthen its commitment to

The European strategic independence must go through the consolidation of its

B UILDING AN E DEFENS BELGIAN MODERN SERVING
POPULATION OF PEACE AND SOLIDARITY

The ambition of our army is to enable it to assume both
interventions for peace on overseas theaters,
and national missions and European aid to the population,
eg dismantling explosives, rescue at sea, using the
population disaster ...

466

This will require courageous choice to wear in strategic terms,
policy and budget but also in terms of human resources.
For the PS, it is essential to establish a new strategic plan 2015-2030
to set a new level of ambition for our defense based on its
expertise. The strategic plan must be accompanied by a program
multi-year investment and equipment.
Strengthening the link between the Defence and the population must also be a
transversal objectives of this next strategic plan, either by the
Strengthening aid missions to the people, support services
public, targeted actions towards youth, clear communication and
seamless, of consultation with local authorities or by a
greater appreciation of the commitment of reservists.
To do this, the proposed PS:


restore the balance between the level of ambition and the means available
for the army, redefining targeted, updated and realistic goals
the light of staff and budgetary resources available;



continue the modernization of the army taking into account the situation
changing international and national level in order to preserve
ambition defined in agreement with our partners, as well as missions and
the priority tasks;


increase collaboration of Defense with other departments
competent ministries by concerted approach in terms of
cooperation, training and equipment purchases to improve further
assistance to the population;



establish a genuine dialogue with all stakeholders,
including local authorities and trade unions, for,
with them, develop a social policy of valuing
military career and well-being at work, which respects the military,
civilian personnel and their families.

In redefining the military priorities of Belgium, the PS proposes to:


encourage and intensify collaborations and synergies with our
European partners, including training and
training;



primarily participate in EU operations;



strengthen the dimension of aid to the populations of the action of the defense,
both inside and outside the country.

Respect for linguistic balance must be achieved within the Army
as recommended by Parliament.
For the PS, the working memory is and will remain a priority. Conservation
memory, awareness of the persecution and the defense of democracy
against extremism are the essential missions of defense.

In this perspective, it is therefore for the PS, to ensure the future of
Veterans Institute / National Institute of War Invalids and continue
ensure that the commemoration of the Great War mobilize all

EUROPE
The European Union faces many critical challenges for its future. The
bad solutions proposed by European conservatives and liberals for
managing the economic and financial crisis have aggravated and undermined the foundations
even of European legitimacy. Europe is increasingly perceived by its
citizens as a social regression machine.
The crisis also accentuated the negative changes in our model
economic and our social model. Today, the social elevator is
failure in Europe: the popular social categories are less likely to
about an improvement in their condition and also to see their children
progress, as the previous generation. The middle classes are afraid of
decommissioning. Inequality is increasing to the benefit of a class
social, the annuitant, which does not contribute enough to the community. These
elements strongly influence the rise of populism in Europe.
When all these elements come together, we both feel that
the social elevator is broken and the fear of falling, which is seen
others whose pension builds up, and all on nationalism and substantive
xenophobia, we realize that the populist threat is far from being a threat
distant. This is a strong and credible threat in some European countries,
especially those who have been most seriously affected by the crisis.
Europe is not the cause of all these ills but has aggravated the situation by
due to political choices that have been posed to respond. It is not
Europe as Europe, it is not the Euro as a currency which are the
problem, but this is how those who led this Europe between 2009
and 2014 have responded by imposing an austerity policy that caused the recession
and have led some states to undermine social rights.
The problem is not Europe, but what we did in
Socialists reject this line of Europe that has imposed a policy
blind and brutal austerity, which encourages cuts in
government spending and investment, which pay for the crisis to those who do
are not responsible, that puts EU citizens competing, which leaves
unemployment - especially young people - and inequality increase without reaction, which
swears by free trade at the expense of genuine political
industrial.
Today, even the IMF dare say there are many multiplier effects
public spending. The OECD dare say that we should support the policies of
purchasing power because it is also support demand policies
interior. The only supranational institution that refuses to change his mind, that is
the European Commission. But as this instance is policy, we
can change its ideological orientation.
European Socialists propose a credible alternative and offer
change the direction of Europe

469

It is in this light that we had proposed a "six-pack Left"
consisting of six concrete proposals that are opposed to six-pack
the right of austerity.
We want, for these proposals, the European project is once again
synonym for citizens, especially young people, hope, solidarity,
cooperation, sustainable and preserve our social model growth
European.
We want to put solidarity at the heart of European policies.
We propose to return to the spirit of the founding fathers: to Europe
supports employment and the revival, which converges wages up and fight
against social and fiscal dumping, which protects its citizens.
We want a Europe of solidarity, more democratic, more integrated and more
strong on the international stage.

TRENGTHENING SOCIAL JUSTICE IN THE UNION
EUROPEAN

The future of Europe is inconceivable under the sole and an angle gearbox
great economic market. The progress of European integration since these
Past 15 years has focused on the money aspect and the
strengthening the internal market without sufficient counterparty plan
political and social.
We must get out of this vision only related to the strengthening of the internal market
defended by the Conservatives to strengthen the European social model based
on a system of social protection, public services, social dialogue and
social rights.
For PS, a convergence of high social standards and a better
integration of social and employment policies must be found quickly.
It is also a condition for the sustainability of the euro zone, whose stability
term will depend on the real convergence of their economies and of its senior
social standards, but also the end of the tendering or
precariousness of its citizens.
The analysis of macroeconomic imbalances by the European Commission
currently based solely on budgetary and financial indicators. This bias
leads to consider employment and social protection as variables
adjustment. This logic is damaging the future of Europe!
For the PS, there must be social objectives and quality jobs at the same
level than purely budgetary or financial considerations. Strengthen
social dimension of economic and monetary union is also
essential if we really want to achieve the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy
sustainable growth, employment, social cohesion and social progress.
Investment in human and social capital and the fight against
470

discrimination must remain, perhaps even more in times of crisis,
priority for Europe.
In this context, the PS proposes to:
 set up a European Social Investment Pact balancing
economic and budgetary criteria of the Stability Pact and
Growth revised criteria by social and employment objectives with
detailed and binding ensuring solidarity between generations
Europe;
 introducing an array of social indicators in the framework of related procedures
strengthening of economic and monetary union, which would be placed under the
sole responsibility of the industry Employment and Social Affairs (EPSCO) and
would detect social imbalances to develop
high social standards in Europe;
 establish in each Member State a minimum income based on social
European common principles that would live in
dignity;
 provide social protection systems the means to play
their full role of redistribution through benefits and access
Universal social services and quality healthcare, regardless
income;
 create a European tripartite platform to assess how the
social dialogue and collective bargaining are supported and implemented
in the Member States;
 maintain and strengthen European legislation on health and safety
but also to work on consumer protection, and review
objectives and the philosophy of the "European program for a
sharp and efficient legislation "(REFIT) to prevent
weakening the rights of European citizens;
 subtract the social services of general interest in the law of the market and

S OUTENIR EMPLOYMENT QUALITY IN E UROPE

The economic and social situation in Europe has been deteriorating since the
2008 crisis and job losses have reached levels particularly
alarming in the most crisis-hit member states. In October 2013,
the unemployment rate in the euro area reached 12.1% and 11% throughout
the European Union. Today, more than 26.7 million men and women
are unemployed in the European Union, including 5.7 million young people
under 25. In Greece and Spain, more than one person in four is
unemployment and in these same two countries is more than one in two young people who
Unemployed !

471

Millions of European citizens are plunged into deep distress and
million young people see their future darken. Employment is the concern
a number of a large majority of Europeans but they feel that
Europe does not hear and does not protect their jobs.
The end of the blind austerity policy conducted by the European right and
real recovery in employment is a priority of the PS. Europe must protect
employment of its citizens and give a future to its youth.
To support employment in Europe, the PS proposes to:
 guarantee young people up to 30 years or to have job or internship or

less additional training through capacity devices
employment update whose "youth guarantee" for which a
European funding of € 8 billion is scheduled for 2014-2015 is
Wallonia and Brussels for 120 million euros (of which 80 million
European funding and co-financing of 40 million);

 sustain the mechanism of "youth guarantee" at European level and

increase the resources devoted to it;

 ensure the involvement of social partners in the development and implementation

implementation of the "Youth Guarantee" in all European countries;

 better coordination - and simplify access procedures - sources

funding at European level such as the European Social Fund
(ESF) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) to develop
joint projects oriented SMEs and savings companies
Social investing in job creation (especially for
youth through the development of training and learning ...);
 maintain means the European Social Fund (ESF) devoted to others

support policies for training and employment;
 encourage the establishment of a European framework for training

alternating (which consists of alternating training between company and
school) for both secondary education and teaching
higher based on the best European practices in this area;

 create a European label for companies that organize training

quality for workers;
 adopt a European legal framework to ensure a standard

common quality for organizing the monitoring of young asylum
employment, so as to minimize the discrimination between countries;

 fight against internships and temporary or fixed-term contracts

successively proposed and therefore abused youth by developing
a binding European framework and developing a European charter
for internships;

 establishing a European stock device to allow

support young people who are studying or training in
occupations of the future defined by the European Union and associated with innovation and
research and development.

We must reaffirm the principle of "equal pay, equal rights," guarantor
fair competition, respect for workers' rights and the right of
work, and European industrial relations systems.
Within the EU, 27 Member States 20 have introduced a salary
minimum, at highly variable levels (between 157 euros / month in Romania
1874 euros / month in Luxembourg). The absence of minimum wage or low
level creates a widespread social dumping within the continent, which destroys
wages of workers and worsens the recession.

REAL RECOVERY POLIT ICAL E EUROPEENN

The European Union must play a real role motor and the stimulus
Economic growth in Europe.
For the PS, you must enable Member States to fight effectively against the
unemployment in Europe and to fund ambitious measures in this area. He
is therefore more than necessary to be able to support the creation of activities
particularly in SMEs, investment and innovation.
We must use the leverage effects offered by the European Cohesion Policy
to support economic development and creation of companies,
research, urban attractiveness and brownfield redevelopment
urban, social inclusion and education, the sustainable integration of young people into
the labor market and the fight against school dropout. For the PS, politics
European cohesion is a fundamental vector for solidarity, justice
and social progress in Europe.
But a European stimulus policy will also go through a
better energy policy because it is potentially carrier million
jobs and will ultimately ensure energy independence
Europe.
In this context, the PS proposes to:


reject the austerity policies imposed by the Conservatives and
defend a rate of return to balanced public finances that
allows not to kill economic activity, employment and services
public;



neutralize public investment spending, education and R & D
in the assessment of compliance with the deficit and standards

to adopt a real plan to revive the ambitious employment but also

S OUTENIR THE EUROPEAN INDUSTRY

475

The industry provides almost a third of the wealth produced in Europe, the
Industrial goods account for almost 75% of our exports and employs
directly almost 57 million people.
Taking into account the benefits:
 every industrial job creates an average of two jobs in services
related;
 industry has a huge impact on employment in Europe.
However, European industry is in crisis. Industrial shock
recent years with their heavy social consequences, but also the
awareness of the risk of decline associated with a lack of cost control
energy, access to strategic raw materials and failure
innovation, are all reasons why the European Union
put industrial policy at the center of its strategic vision for 2020.
The industry is a guarantee of economic independence.
The industry of tomorrow must also contribute to the new challenges are
climate change and aging populations. Its link
research and development and our centers of excellence, both in
called exact sciences than in the humanities, is therefore essential.
Today it is no longer possible to stop thinking about the industry
Europe's borders. Instead, we must place it in a global context and
relocating production systems. Of circular economy put devices
up by Wallonia, which aim to pool resources, needs and
issues (in particular with regard to the recycling of waste) between
sectors 'complementary' can contribute to this relocation
production systems.
Governments must play a leading role in
support for industrial change and crises. They must, where
appropriate, have recourse to State aid, where these are relevant to
cushioning.
The PS therefore intends to work towards converging all policies that can
lead to a real and effective implementation of a new policy
industrial. It supports the goal of contribution of 20% of GDP in 2020.
In this context, the PS proposes to:


make industrial policy a European policy, and cross
develop better synergies with other policies:
o

Trade policy: in the context of its positioning
specifically within the World Trade Organization, industry
should be a central concern of the European Union. He
should promote fair and genuine trade
reciprocity in trade, for example by activating tools
trade defense as soon as the need is felt;

o

energy policy: energy, access to energy and cost,
are the first competitive handicaps of the European Union.
476

It is therefore necessary to quickly ensure the independence of the Union
through trade agreements and policies of
development of sustainable alternative energy;
o

climate policy: the EU must have goals
ambitious and realistic climate while integrating social impact and
Economic thereof and with particular attention to
vulnerable industries;

o

employment and training policy: employment and training are
essential dimensions of industrial policy of the future. The
employees of the industrial sector should benefit
training
continuous. These courses will be based on if necessary
partnerships with the world of technical education or
university;

o

o

policy and transport infrastructure: transport
are an essential component of competitiveness
industrial. It will be based on a sustainable vision, including through
reflection on the short circuits and the need for development or
maintaining close industries, but also sustainable
for the sustainability of European industry;

o

the special attention to SME policy: the industry is indeed
Built in territories and it is on these territories that are born,
grow and prosper SMEs, dynamic tokens



be based on smart specialization areas, as proposed
by the European Commission, in its cohesion policy, for

THE UTTER DUMP ING AGAINST FRAUD AND A WEDGE FIS

The absence of harmonization or coordination in direct taxation
Europe has meant that each Member State competes
with others to attract capital to its territory and to the detriment of its
national citizens.
Indeed, the reduction in capital contribution to system needs
National must be offset by reductions in state benefits
and / or an increase in taxes payable by citizens.
Europe is currently working on the corporate income tax with the aim of
determining a common consolidated tax base in all Member States. This
However, the project is idle and is strongly opposed by the countries that have
kindnesses introduced schemes to attract capital from other countries. There
issue of harmonization of rates is by no means against the order of the day
while it is an essential element to counter complacency plans
which become real tax predators pulling down the contribution
capital. For European experts, it takes a real minimum tax
European that should not limit itself to set a minimum rate but must also
allow Member States to ensure the financing of their social protection
and their public services through a fair contribution of capital.
We must fight against fiscal dumping in Europe but also make every
work to develop progressive and redistributive tax systems in
they contribute to the funding of European welfare systems.
We must also fight against tax havens. The revelations related
Offshore leaks have confime the PS denounced for years: fraud
Tax has a considerable impact on the revenues of States. It represents
Today in Europe 850 billion euros lost each year which must be
add 150 billion euros of tax evasion, totaling 1,000
billion, the equivalent of the EU budget for seven years lost all
years!
To fight against dumping and tax evasion, the PS proposes to:


keep fighting to establish a transaction tax
Financial (FTT) to fight against speculation, the scope
Application covers transactions on all shares,
bonds, foreign exchange and derivatives of any kind,
integrating all financial institutions active in
transaction related to a security issued in one Member State and not
Limited to institutions in the territory;



require the introduction of a progressive tax on income from capital
(and / or a tax on fortune articulated around a common tax base)
at European level and the establishment of a register of fortunes
European;



require the introduction at European level of a minimum corporate tax
and harmonization of tax bases to stop competition
tax between States, which mainly benefits the groups
478

transnational;

7.



limit, the Belgian and European levels, the foreign tax deduction
only taxes that were actually paid abroad when
beneficiaries are multinational groups;



more effective fight against tax havens within the region
euro and monitor capital flows to financial centers
offshore (tax havens) using the capital marking
using TTF;



continue work to fight against aggressive tax planning
multinationals and tax havens;



establish a code of conduct on harmful tax practices
determined action to boost Belgium's level to the plan
OECD action on the erosion of the tax base and transfer
Earnings (said plane BEPS) to succeed abroad and ensures fair
tax contribution of multinational enterprises;


actively engage in the establishment of a multilateral platform
to extend the application of the Savings Directive to all
instruments and financial players and forecast market exclusion
European non-participating entities for the automatic exchange
information on assets deposited by citizens of the Union
European banks in other Member States.

P RETURN F inancial CRISES

For the PS, Europe must protect its citizens from the consequences of crises
financial. It must protect through an economic model based on
solidarity and implement mechanisms to prevent
new crises through the consolidation of the architecture of the euro area and
that the supervision and regulation of finance.
The consolidation of the architecture of the euro area
The introduction of the euro has strengthened the financial interdependence between the MemberStates of the eurozone. This has many financial integration
advantages in terms of financing of the economies of member states.
However, the current crisis has shown that it also carries risks.
To deal with the crisis in the euro zone, several elements of solidarity saw
the day such as the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) or the announcement by the
President of the European Central Bank (ECB) the possibility for the ECB
to buy potentially unlimited sovereign debt securities
on secondary markets (OMT program or "money transactions
Securities ").
While the MES is the first step of a risk pooling and
introduction of a form of solidarity, it is however conditioned to
this to the imposition of fiscal austerity measures in countries
receiving financial assistance. We must reverse this logic by
deeply modifying the conditions for the grant of financial assistance
479

but above all to organize, at European level, greater solidarity
to prevent and manage crises.
For the PS, it is urgent to put in place mechanisms that endow the area
euro powerful tools of anticipation and crisis management, regardless
their nature or origin, through genuine solidarity among the states
up.
In this context, the PS proposes to:


pooling a large part of the debts of the Member States by the
creation of Eurobonds (bonds issued and guaranteed in common
by States of the euro area) to develop solidarity, reduce
risks and bring more stability in Europe while maintaining
conditionality that promotes growth;



allow even wider buying public debt securities
by the ECB;



to ensure that the ECB could develop on the same footing as
fight against inflation, a real policy to support growth and
employment;



abolish the Troika (the European Commission, the Bank
Central European and International Monetary Fund) that takes
decisions that affect the public services, purchasing power,
the European social model; in order that only European players
such as the European Commission and the European Central Bank
may in future be in a crisis while being accountable to
the European Parliament to strengthen the democratic legitimacy of their
decisions;



grant broad own fiscal capacity to the European Union to
stabilize its budget to an ambitious level;



strengthen social stability instruments in Europe.

The supervision and regulation of finance
Between 2008 and 2011, European citizens spent $ 1.600 billion
to save the banks. The interdependence between the state and banks creates a
vicious circle since the fragility of the financial sector increases
sovereign risk, and the increase in sovereign risk weakening, in turn, the
financial sector. A profound reform of the architecture of the financial system
is necessary to limit the interdependence between the state and banks and
systemic risks arising therefrom.
Voluntarism PS has enabled Belgium to adopt an ambitious reform
bank, unique in Europe (See also part Financing SMEs) with
including the following: the prohibition of speculation on behalf
clean, supervision of speculative activities on behalf of clients,
fairer remuneration and the prohibition of manipulations during the
foodstuffs. The PS calls for these reforms to be extended
level of the European Union with the same degree of ambition.
480

But, more broadly, we must regulate the capitalist market in Europe. It is necessary
address the root causes of the crisis: financial deregulation, excessive size
banks, enterprises dependence on the banking sector to
funding and unrealistic performance expectations of the shareholders
urging banks and businesses to take unnecessary risks.
In this context, the PS proposes to:


build a genuine European banking union that will include not
only the single supervisory mechanism but also a mechanism
Unique guarantee savers' deposits and a single fund
resolution of banks to allow orderly closure of
failing banks, both funded by the financial sector and not
by European taxpayers;



better protect investors by ensuring the effective implementation
General privilege depositors benefit by requiring each
European bank holding a volume of non-encumbered assets for
to cover its deposits in case of bankruptcy;



better regulate wages in banks with more guidance
strict variable compensation, it can only be linked to
long-term objectives and the results of all of the bank and
not related to the sale of specific products;



accelerate the work undertaken to stop the excessive risk culture
in some banks and strengthen banking stability
European;



separate trading of deposit operations and prohibit
Speculation own account so that risky activities do not
more danger savers and businesses;



review the structure of the financial sector, better regulated and oriented
financing the real economy, with particular attention to
small and medium business financing needs;



better regulate the activities of alternative investment funds and especially
hedge funds (hedge funds) to strive for application
rules similar to those that apply to the traditional banking sector;



prohibit the purchase, subscription, sale, supply, dissemination or
promotion of financial instruments whose obvious purpose is to
depend on the performance of the investment speculation
the evolution of indices linked to the price of agricultural raw materials;



establish an effective shield in terms of governance,
risk management and organization in order to optimally protect
customer segments "individuals" and "business" of activities
negotiation implemented by financial institutions;



strengthen the system for punishing behavior
irresponsible at financial institutions due to lack of
probity and ethics in the acts performed;

481



ensure that all measures to lighten structures
balance sheet of banks in order to optimize the requirements in terms of
liquidity and solvency are considered as decisions
Strategic subject to the discretion of the supervisory authority;



creating a European agency and independent public rating;



work to develop globally harmonized
work methods used by rating agencies;



Ensure reduce reliance on rating agencies;



ensure the transparency obligation of ratings
Kings ;



ensure establish a monitoring system, permanent and effective,
to identify as early as possible among gravitating associations
European circles making, financial or other lobbies, which
pursue the particular objectives, often opposed to the interest
General of European citizens, and develop ways to
reduce their influence.

P rotect THE E UR OPE AN OPEN - unbridled EXCHANGE

In the context of a deadlock in multilateral trade negotiations
Doha Round launched in 2001, the European Union relaunched negotiations
Trade with major partners through ambitious agreements
free trade, convinced that trade and financial liberalization was
boost economic growth. By promoting freedom of action firms
multinationals, the conclusion of these agreements has led to many of today
scourges: deindustrialization, competition between states causing
deterioration of working conditions, increasing social inequality,
relocations, human exploitation, etc.
For the PS, the EU must be the engine of world trade fair, sustainable and
solidarity. It should advocate internationally justeéchange a policy consistent with its values, its foreign policy and its policy of
Development (See chapter International).
Free trade must be accompanied by rules to defend our economy,
prevent social dumping and relocations. We want a real
protection of our jobs and our businesses.
To do this, the proposed PS:


include systematically in all free trade agreements and
promotion agreements and investment protection, including
through the revision of the texts used for their trading models, concluded
by Belgium and the EU, social and environmental standards
binding, accompanied by financial or trade sanctions,
controlled by the national parliaments of the countries concerned and the
European Parliament, involving the social partners and society
civil;

482



advocate for include in these agreements, an automatic exchange of
tax data so that they serve as a lever for the fight against fraud and
tax havens;



exclude public services and general interest (education, health,
culture, water, etc.) of any commercialization;



protect and promote cultural diversity by including in all
trade agreements, a reference to the Unesco Convention on the
Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions;



protect personal data and the right to privacy in all
trade negotiations;



corporate responsibility to respect social norms and
Environmental throughout their production chain by
the establishment of a European anti-dumping mechanism in which the non-compliance standards would be subject to a levy assigned to
relevant international institutions, such as the ILO, which will ensure
the gradual implementation of these standards in the most affected countries;



refuse in agreements, particularly those concluded with States
OECD members such as transatlantic treaty, the presence of a
Arbitration clause allowing direct actions by investors
Private against democratic decisions taken by States,
favoring the use of arbitration between States in cases of
discriminatory and unfair treatment of Belgian investors
abroad;



ensure social and environmental traceability
marketed to provide consumers with information
transparent and complete on social, health and
environmental production of goods "Made in the World" (products
whose production process has been divided in different parts of
world);



guarantee in any international agreement on trade and investment
special and differential treatment (SDT) for developing countries
development. Industrial, it would involve particular
enable poor countries to impose import restrictions
and performance requirements to transnational firms, to apply
specific subsidy policies to strategic sectors of
benefit from flexibility on patents related to technology access and
to dispose of tariff exemptions to protect their economies
nascent. In agriculture, this would imply notably eliminate
Public subsidies for agricultural commodities for export;



intervene at all levels of government involved in the negotiations
between the EU and third countries to promote human rights and
sustainable development, including by calling on all countries in the strict
compliance with UN recommendations and advocacy organizations
of Human Rights, and to refuse ratification of agreements fulfilling
not these conditions.

TRENGTHENING

The E COUTE

AND

THE

RESPECT

OF

CITIZENS

EUROPEAN

The democratic deficit in Europe has worsened since the 2008 crisis
and austerity policies that have been implemented. To remedy this, it is necessary
revise substantially the institutions that
democratic Europe is not supplanted by the technocratic Europe.
In this context, the proposed PS:


ensure protection of privacy of all European citizens;



strengthen the role of the European Parliament, the only elected European institution
by universal suffrage, notably by granting a right of initiative
legislative, extending co-decision, by granting a right of
Commission working control for all its activities;



strengthen the role of the CoR in the decision process
European so as to provide thereto a dimension
pragmatic that local and regional authorities are able
print considering the proximity they have vis-à-vis
populations affected by those decisions;



strengthen the role of national parliaments to weigh more on
Council, in particular in economic and supervision
budget;



designate, within each European party, a candidate for the Presidency
Commission and submit his election to Parliament vote
EU to strengthen its position vis-à-vis legitimacy of it, with
term objective the achievement of a genuine parliamentary democracy
European.

10. G NSURING RESPECT OF VALUES ES ES EUROPEENN
European values ​​(respect for pluralism, equality between women and
men, non-discrimination, the rule of law, human rights,
Justice) have been violated by several Member States in recent months,
by adopting national legislation in flagrant contradiction with them.
The adoption by Hungary of controversial laws on the control of the press and on
the independence of the judiciary and its central bank is a good example.
For the PS, these attacks require strong institutions and adequate response
European, guardians of the treaties. But this response is nonexistent up
today as legal instruments exist as Article 7 of the Treaty
on European Union (TEU), which gives Europe the means to ensure the
respect for those values ​​by all Member States.
If it is not to undermine the sovereignty of a member state, its
history, its language or its own culture, you can not join the European project
without respecting its values, its rights, its foundations. These are the
guarantees that the EU is indeed a common project for all citizens
component.
484

For the PS, the European institutions can not just observe without
act in the matter. The Union can not only be attentive to
budgetary procedures and ignore breaches its values ​​and the rights and
freedoms of Europeans whatever their origin, opinion or guidance
sexual.
The economic crisis must not become a breeding ground for discourse and
Conservative legislation questioning our social gains, egalitarian and
progressive touching the lowest facto. It is only thanks to the rights and
duties listed by the European treaties and conventions and by the will
policy that the EU could become an example of Nobel Prize-winning peace. History
Europe must remember that folds on itself, selfishness and
nationalism is a threat to the European project uniting our peoples.
In this context, the proposed PS:


strengthen and simplify the activation of the control mechanisms and
political and diplomatic effective sanctions of proven by
Member States to European values ​​enshrined in the Treaties
Europe and in the European Convention on Human Rights
the man ;



promote greater synergy in this context between the skills
the European Commission and the Council of Europe notably
providing for the possibility for the Commission to the European Court
human rights ;



affirm the impartiality and neutrality of the European institutions
fight against the will expressed by conservative movements
populist challenge vested in ethics
Europe;



reaffirm the fundamental values ​​of equality and rights of individuality
and ensure that every European decision the principles of equality
between women and men and non-discrimination towards all
the components of European society and are effectively guaranteed
assessed ad hoc basis;



ensure the implementation of the principle of gender mainstreaming in
all policies decided at EU level;



promote and implement initiatives and instruments such as Erasmus
to strengthen and build on the "European citizenship"
as an essential vehicle for employment, training and growth.

11. TRENGTHENING THE ACTION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ON
International scene

In spite of the Lisbon Treaty which effectively strengthens its means of action
exterior, including the creation of a European External Action Service,
EU struggles to assert itself as a global player
major: foreign policy is secondary, and responsiveness to crises
regional minimum (the crises in Libya and Mali are sad examples
Recent).

485

Recent developments in the global context, particularly in the southern Mediterranean,
illustrated the weakness of European foreign policy because of divisions
Recurrent policies within Member States.
Belgium, pioneer in European integration must continue
support for the objectives of the Lisbon Treaty to enhance coherence and
the effectiveness of the European Union on the international stage.
In order to strengthen EU foreign policy, the PS proposes to:


end unanimity in decisions on policy
Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) while giving it a
greater involvement of the European Parliament;



strengthening the EU's diplomatic representations abroad and their
skills, seeking synergies and designating attached
joint military;



ask the European External Action Service to make available
Member States its analysis and recommendations, dispose of
Member States;



supporting EU crisis management missions and encourage
active and coordinated participation of Member States in these missions;



support the political involvement of the High Representative for politics
in foreign countries in democratic transition;



encourage the EU to strengthen its regional partnerships, including with
the African Union, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States
(CELAC), the Arab League, the Association of Nations of South-east Asia
(ASEAN);



strengthen its support for neighboring countries in transition, including by
the creation of multidisciplinary teams to provide assistance
Legal and technical assistance to countries to benefit from the expertise
necessary and by creating a specific budget line to
subject in the context of the next budget planning;



enhance the role of the EU in the management of humanitarian crises
Natural, including developing a rapid reaction force
European level so that EU FAST;



improve the coherence of EU external policy with the objectives
development (see Chapter International);



consolidate the position, legal and de facto, of the EU in pregnant
international and in informal international meetings such as
the G8, the G20, the United Nations, in terms of representation,
Preparation and monitoring of cases;



consolidate security policy and European defense for it
be a real tool of its foreign policy (see Chapter Defense).

INTERNATIONAL
Liberal globalization as we are experiencing is deeply unfair
and spawned many scourges relocations, de-industrialization,
increasing inequality, human exploitation, insecurity, impoverishment,
climate challenges, questioning the social achievements, denigration rights
social ...
While billions of people worldwide living in poverty and
do not have the minimum resources that allows a dignified existence,
a minority of individuals accounts for a growing share of the common wealth.
Today, in 2014, the world has more than 1,500 billionaires
including, for example, the most fortunate alone has eight times the total budget
a nation of seventy million people as the Republic
Republic of the Congo. This finding demonstrates the pressing need to imagine
another type of societal system.
PS, internationalist party, wants to break with this ultra-liberal globalization,
blind capitalist who responds only to the interests of multinationals and
great powers, to build a world of progress and development
sustainable shared for all citizens of the world.

1. B UILDING AN MONDIA LEFT LISATION: HUMAN
SOLIDARITY

The left of globalization is a globalization based on values
solidarity, justice, ethics, fair development. Its construction goes
first by strengthening global democracy and multilateralism,
but by a just and fair regulation of trade and commerce
world that respects the economic and social rights, respects
the environment and the fight against inequality in the world. This action
passes by both the federal state as all other levels of power
in our country as well as Europe.
1.1.

STRENGTHENING Multilateralism

To strengthen multilateralism, the PS proposes to:


boost the UN reform both in terms of representativeness
in its decision-making process in order to strengthen its legitimacy and to
increase efficiency;



breaking with the current logic where commercial imperatives and
"Let - let 'have de facto primacy over the rights
humans. Texts such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights, the Covenant of
UN on civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, or the
Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of
cultural expressions should receive more attention. There
mission of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should thus be
487

refocused on the stabilization of the international financial system, that of
World Bank financing for global public goods and that
of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on regulation
international trade fair market goods in compliance
social and environmental standards established by particular
International Labour Organization (ILO);


request and within Multilateral Development Banks such
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD), the first criterion for selection of projects to fund either the impact
Social and tangible improvement of people's living conditions
local;



strengthen the binding nature of international organizations
promote the non-profit International Law at the United Nations
(ILO, WHO, UNESCO, etc.) and claim cost reduction
administrative and communications of these organizations;



establish an Economic Security Council, social and
UN environment with binding powers workforce that
would be responsible to make globalization more social by ensuring
respect of decent work, social justice in the world and a
salary for a dignified life;



establish a fair and transparent international body for
independent resolution of sovereign debt problems in order to
prevent future debt crises;



priority in case of crisis prevention efforts, dialogue and
diplomacy at all levels and in all multilateral fora;



to register any use of force in a UN mandate (see also
Chapter Defence).

Many multilateral forums dealing with regional powers or
Community (innovation, sustainable economy, education, agriculture, human
human, gender equality, protection of minorities, etc.). The Federation
Wallonia-Brussels (FWB) and Wallonia must also make their contribution to
defending these common values.
To do this, the proposed PS:


strengthen action and visibility of Wallonia and in the FWB
international organizations to which regional and skills
Community are concerned, such as the International Organization
Francophonie, UNESCO, the United Nations, the Council of Europe,
OECD in particular ensuring that the commissioners in the
countries where these organizations serve effectively turns priorities are
federal entities in international affairs;



continue its work within the Francophonie to strengthen the place of
organization in the world that can be a real player in the
promoting peace, democracy and the consolidation of the rule of
law ;

488



support the organization of international events such as the Forum
the French language to be held in Liège in 2015;



encourage, in partnership with European countries, consideration and
respect for human rights, freedom of expression, conditions
social and environmental during the application and in fine
the allocation of sports events with an international dimension (Cup
world, Olympic Games ...).

The neoliberal globalization process has led to social dumping, fiscal and
Environmental between States, exacerbated by firms' strategies
transnational dominated by the search for short-term financial profits.
Transparency measures are needed both at the regional level, state
Federal and EU, to ensure compliance with social standards and
environmental and curb tax evasion and social inequalities. In this
meaning, fair trade should be considered as an example
encourage and promote.
Thus, to make it fair global trade, sustainability and solidarity, PS
proposes:


promotion agreements and investment protection, including
through the revision of the texts used for their trading models, concluded
by Belgium and the EU, social and environmental standards

the gradual implementation of these standards in the most affected countries;


refuse in agreements, particularly those concluded with States
OECD members such as transatlantic treaty, the presence of a
Arbitration clause allowing direct actions by investors

for tax reasons;

as an essential tool for preventing and reducing poverty,
inequality, social exclusion and social insecurity. Social protection

people from poverty. It is closely linked to employment and brings
frequently support for those unable to work. The protection

resource and designing biodegradable or fully
reusable and non-polluting);

P ROMOTING POLITI QUES OF EXTERNAL COH erent
AND FURTHER

Respect for human rights and democracy are and must remain the basis
of our foreign policy. Our country must continue to defend its values
solidarity and justice in the world by strengthening its partnerships, and
supporting democratic transition in the country. The PS wants to break with the
neocolonialist attitudes and develop bilateral partnerships based
on the values ​​of equality and mutual respect. This action must be conducted as
although the traditional federal community and regional diplomacy
as well as parliamentary, caring coherence and complementarity
conducted policy.
To strengthen the position of Belgium on the international scene, the PS
proposes:


clearly position Belgium as a member of the Security Council
United Nations;

492



increase the resources of the European Investment Bank
finance projects supporting democratic transitions;



support regional integration building initiatives;



cancel bilateral debts of poor countries and transition
to free democratic means to finance projects



defend the "click of the right", particularly the freedoms of expression,
assembly or association online via access to a free Internet that is
become a political factor of change, economic, social and
environmental.

To enhance the effectiveness and impact of the international action of the Federation
Wallonia-Brussels and Wallonia, the PS will:


continue optimizing the network of delegates in Wallonia-Brussels
strengthening synergies with networks of AWEX and Wallonia /
Tourism Brussels and with the Federal diplomacy;



strengthen the coordination role of Wallonia-Brussels International
(WBI) in the vast field of international-related skills
(education / teaching, research and innovation, health, training,
sustainable development, environment, culture, economy ...) while
strengthening synergies with the Walloon Export Agency and
Investment (AWEX) for the internationalization of enterprises to
put more external relations for development
economic, social and cultural development of our regions;



pursue bilateral partnerships to support solidarity
international with countries, regions and local operators and South
improve program evaluation processes in place;



strengthen its support of democracy to countries with a
political transition through specific programs (training
the judiciary, training of journalists, training of women
policy, training union action, etc.) and thereby, strengthen the
cultural, social and economic dialogue with these countries.

To strengthen the parliamentary diplomacy, the PS proposes to:


continue the implementation of partnership programs between
Assemblies
Parliamentarians

The world is changing. Its economic and geostrategic center of gravity
slowly moving from the Atlantic to the Pacific West Asia. Politics
Foreign Belgium should be considered. The global context is also
marked by revolts of the peoples aspiring to freedom, democracy and
social justice.
Our country must make its experience and expertise in paying
priority on a few key areas.
493

In Central Africa, the Belgian government must continue to fully support
the stabilization of the region and to strengthen democratic institutions
countries in the region, particularly the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
Rwanda and Burundi. It is necessary that the Belgian army continue its
assistance to the process of training the Congolese army and wider
the security reform in the DRC to help stabilize the country and
this crucial area. The socio-economic reconstruction of the region and
process of reconciliation between communities must also be
supported. Belgium must restructure and better coordinate its presence in
Central Africa and to establish a strong and comprehensive partnership whose orientations
would be defined by the organization of biannual summits between Belgium and
the states of this region.
In the Middle East, Belgium must continue to defend the solution based on the
coexistence of two states, with the State of Israel and a Palestinian state
independent, democratic, contiguous and viable and to support any
initiative for dialogue and peace. Israeli peoples
Palestinians have both the right to live in peace and security in both
Democratic and independent states with international borders
recognized. The EU, which will not recognize any change to the Boundary
pre-1967, has become a real player in this peace process,
in particular to ensure the sustainability of economic support and construction
Gradual of a Palestinian state.
In Mediterranean countries, which are in a turning point in their
history Belgium and the EU must support more than ever, process
democratic transition. Our country must push the issue at European level
so that the EU raise a strong Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, equal to the
expectations of the peoples on both sides. The PS supports the Belgian military presence
Lebanon (within the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) as
factor contributing to the stabilization of the country and the region.
In the Sahel, Belgium must continue its contributions to the reconstruction and
stabilization of states, especially Mali, while encouraging
development of regional projects and economic integration. The stabilization
Sahel remains a major challenge given the weapons trade,
drugs and terrorist gangs that plague the region and are a
threat to Africa but also for Europe. The elections of July 2013
Mali is a first step towards the restoration of the institutions in this country.
This stabilization through various actions, including a plan
long-term development and specific actions in countries
particularly affected as in Mali.

F ACILITATING OF THE VI E B EL GHG RESIDENT ABROAD

Despite the physical distance, Belgians living abroad to keep
against our country a very strong emotional bond. They also contribute to
promote the image of Belgium in the world, and help forge links
friendship and solidarity with other states. This role and this fidelity are
important and deserve special attention of the Belgian state.

494

To make life easier for Belgians abroad, the PS proposes to:


create review Committee attached to the House of Representatives who
would be responsible for relaying the concerns of Belgians living
abroad;



allow Belgian nationals born abroad and having the
Belgian nationality from birth without having to keep it
Conservatory perform a declaration of nationality from their

federal, regional or community, and could
develop specific brochures dedicated to Belgians abroad.

the

Furthermore, there is currently no legal basis on assistance

That is why the proposed PS:

to pass a law on consular assistance specifying the rights
and duties of Belgians in distress abroad.

TRENGTHENING THE INTERNATIONAL Solidari TE: ASSISTANCE
MORE EFFICIENT, MORE CONSISTENT POLICY

In a context of global economic and financial crisis, ODA
(ODA) guard, more than ever, critically important because it
is the most predictable channel, stable and focused to reach populations
495

the poorest and most vulnerable. It is therefore essential to maintain political
strong international solidarity and further develop
transparent partnerships worldwide.
For the PS, strengthening international solidarity requires not only
by a policy of effective development cooperation but also by
consistency in all Belgian politicians, in particular commercial,
financial, energy, environmental and security to ensure that these
past does not affect development goals (this is
called policy coherence for development).
The revision of the law on Belgian development cooperation supported by the PS
offers a modern vision of international solidarity, based on principles
progressives, such as the fight against exclusion and inequality consolidation
civil society, respect of decent work, the promotion of protection
social. Moreover, gender equality and environmental protection
now occupies a central place in development cooperation.
To enhance the effectiveness of development aid, the PS proposes to:


reaffirm the goal of reaching the 0.7% of ODA
development in relation to gross national income;



increase transparency and control over investments
Private benefiting from public funding (blending operations);



strengthening donor alignment with development strategies
defined by the beneficiary countries with the participation of civil society
local;



encourage, at European level, donor harmonization, by a
enhanced joint programming;



count as ODA only really affected resources
development programs and projects in partner countries
(helps reduce the so-called "ghost");



establish a universal social protection floor, including creating
a global fund for social protection;



support civil societies Least Developed Countries (LDCs), the United
fragile and middle-income countries in their educational work
citizen and social mobilization;



promote the development of progressive taxation in the country
partners, including support for local tax authorities,
to help to mobilize sustainable financial resources,
necessary for their development;



develop innovative forms of cooperation, involving
various actors in North and South (cities / towns,
NGOs, trade unions, migrant / diaspora, mutual societies, universities ...) and
promoting triangular or trilateral cooperation (that is to say,
partnerships between traditional donors and several countries
South);
496



defend the specificities and added value of all the actors
Non-governmental cooperation, including support for
academic and scientific international cooperation.

In addition to the key sectors where Belgium and its federated entities
have a real expertise such as education, health, agriculture,
basic infrastructure and the democratization of institutions, cooperation
Development must be the engine of the coherence of Belgian policy
for development (PCD) in the five areas including fixed at
European level: trade and finance, food security, migration,
safety and environment. PS Thanks to an ambitious mechanism has been set
up to previously evaluated in terms of CPD, all decisions
policies that have an impact on developing countries. Thus, a
Ministerial Conference, an interdepartmental commission and a Council
Advisory on SCP were created. The PS will fight for that through this
mechanism of concrete progress, also beyond
Department of Development Cooperation, both nationally
to strengthen international and European solidarity.
In this sense, the PS proposes to:


promoting innovative sources of development finance
including introducing a tax on financial transactions,
some would finance international politics country assistance
developing in the fight against climate change;



establish a genuine regulation of the international financial system,
notably by dismantling tax havens, and fighting against
tax evasion practices by requiring, for example, firms
multinationals to provide their consolidated annual accounts, the
detail, country by country, establishment of their subsidiaries, the number
of of these employees, the turnover volume and taxes
paid, to match the tax contribution levels
each country to the reality of economic activity;



ensure a fairer world trade (see section on trade
World);



cancel bilateral and multilateral debts, starting with the
illegitimate odious debts of heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC), and more
largely those in the least developed countries (LDCs) and, for this conduct
Belgian claims of audit vis-à-vis these countries;



defend policies consistent with the right to food (see
also the point "Fighting against inequality in the world").

All proposals must be carried out at national level in accordance
a differentiated approach depending on the specific countries but also in the
international framework, including through the pursuit of the objectives of
Millennium Development Goals, and participation in the definition of the new
universal framework for post-2015 development.
