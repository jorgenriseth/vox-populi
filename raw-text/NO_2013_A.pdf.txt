1) We take on Norway
Norway is good country to live in, and a country with enormous possibilities. Our task is to manage development so
opportunities apply to all. So that wealth we earn us the common good. So that
we preserve unity, confidence and desire to contribute. What makes the Norwegian community well.
The desire for freedom and the need for security is the basis for everything we do. We must ensure the safety of
society that individual people can live free and good life. Everyone has a responsibility to contribute to
community. Everyone has something to contribute.
19. March 2012 we rounded five million inhabitants in the country. In just 17 years, in 2029 we will be 6
million. The next four years will largely be a matter of building land on, so that we can create
jobs and secure homes, infrastructure and welfare services to all these citizens.
In the period 2013-2017 will Labor particularly prioritize five major tasks:
1. Work for all
To ensure employment for all, we need to have a safe economic management. We will create tomorrow
jobs, through an active industrial policy where we dare to invest in the areas where Norway
has natural advantages. We will continue the simplification of the business community. In a time of great international
competition and constant attacks against workers' rights will Labor fighting to preserve
Norwegian working life as we know it, and prevent social dumping and brutalisation.
2. Knowledge
People are our most important resource, and therefore we must invest in knowledge. That is best achieved through
good, public school system. To continue to make the school better, we will focus on teachers, including
through increased continuing education and less bureaucracy in school life. We need more people who are
good in science, and therefore we will implement a matt boost in school. Today, it is often too long before they
who need extra help getting there. Therefore, we give them a read-write count-lift.
3. Health
The most important thing we can do in health policy is to ensure that fewer become ill. Therefore, we must work for a good
public health. Through better coordination and increased specialization should our hospitals become even better
to cure the most serious suffering, and several should be helped near to where they live in those cases where it is
possible. Through new technology and solutions we can facilitate greater freedom and safety for the
who need care and assistance, and ensuring that more people can get live at home longer. The government must work
actively to recruit enough staff to health care in the years ahead.
4. All must contribute
Everyone has something to contribute. Therefore is work line basis for our welfare policy. We need everyone.
The same applies to tax our. We will not have zero tax payers, but preserving wealth tax
and ensure that those who have much to contribute more to the Dutch treat than those who have less. We want
a change of pace in the cooperation between the public and voluntary sectors. When we get more, we also need more
that can help. Volunteerism is a cornerstone of our society.
5. Building country further
We will build the country further. We will continue the all-time transport boost and provide good roads and
reliable railway systems. Everyone should have the opportunity to have a good home, therefore we need a new and
active housing policy. To keep pace with that Norway grows, we must simplify the planning process and take overall
grip. Public services will become easier and more accessible.
We will take further Norway - along with all those who every day makes an enormous effort for our country, and
all those who share our vision for tomorrow's Norway.

2) Our ideas

I've often been traveling for my work. Many conversations with colleagues in other countries have done me
aware of the qualities in our Norwegian society:
Small differences, good arrangements to preserve strong, harmonious community and equal opportunities to
realize their own ambitions.
It is particularly important that we all in childhood and early youth attend the same school. Experiences from a
Private school creates trust, belonging, and the basis for harmonious community in adulthood.

Trust and unity
Labour's vision is a just world without poverty and peace, where people are free and equal
and have an influence on their lives. All people are unique, irreplaceable and of equal worth. Each of us
shall have the opportunity to live a good life in small and large communities. We want a society based on freedom,
solidarity and equal opportunities for all.
The Norwegian welfare model is based on high labor force participation, and cooperation between state
and the social partners, a wide comprehensive welfare society for all and a wide tax base. High Trust
and willingness cohesion is an important explanation for the development of the Norwegian welfare society qualities -
with small differences in living conditions, a universal welfare state and high labor market participation and civil
society. A strong social capital is one of the hallmarks of the Norwegian model.
Trust and unity between people creates a sense of belonging and good fellowship. Belonging and good
Communities in turn contributes to the trust and cohesion in society.
Deteriorating confidence, it requires a lot to rebuild it. We must have a strong awareness of how
political direction choices affect confidence and cohesion. We must fight against a policy that weakens
community, leading to greater inequalities and erodes the public, universal welfare provision.
Freedom
Social democracy is a freedom project. Our goal is a just society that ensures human freedom,
work, security, belonging and equal opportunities. Freedom presupposes certain fundamental rights for
all. Without voting rights, free speech and rule of law there is no freedom.
To provide equal opportunities for all is a necessary precondition for freedom for all. Freedom is all about opportunity
to live his life such a will and realize their potential. Inequities, major differences and injustice gives unfreedom.
Freedom also means letting others, giving others freedom. Therefore followed rights of responsibilities and duties. All
people have a responsibility for themselves, for others and for the community. Through releasing others and take
responsibility for each other and for the community strengthened cohesion and trust. Society becomes safer. And
security means freedom.
Policy must provide job opportunities and participation for all and progress and motivation for those already
is with. Every single human being is responsible for shaping their own lives. The Community shall form a
society that makes this possible.
Communities
Social Democracy's historical project has been to create the most freedom for different individuals. This
is best achieved through community. Community gives individuals more freedom and greater security
than that man alone can create. Freedom presupposes that everyone has equal opportunities. We can only
achieved through strong community. All are given equal access to basic social services, funded by
community in that everyone pays tax according to ability.
We live and develop together with others, not alone. The sum of our joint efforts is more than what each
one of us contributes. Strong community has its own value. To belong to small and large communities help
for both security and freedom.
Creating and sharing
Work is an important source of creative work and expression, for self-development and community with others.
Through work we achieve income and financial security. The main source of value creation in Norway
people's work. Low unemployment and security in the workplace means that we strengthen value creation.
An active labor movement which has gained influence and taken responsibility has played a decisive role
value creation in Norway. Workers who are safe in the workplace and participating in the development of enterprise,
are more creative, flexible and dedicated. They create more. Creativity and innovation that are triggered
among the employees when they participate in the design of his or her workday, is one of our main
competitive advantage.
8

Values ​​have to be created, and they must be shared fairly. Creating and sharing are mutually reinforcing
and interdependent, we must create in order to have something to share. At the same time equitable distribution and good
welfare services contribute to increased productivity. The most developed welfare society is therefore also among
the most productive. Private industry players to meet an efficient public sector and have predictable
and favorable framework conditions. We want an interaction between business, social partners and the
public to create more.
There is an intrinsic value that we have a settlement, various types of businesses and different characteristics in all parts of
country. This is part of our national identity. It is a social responsibility to ensure this.
Diversity
Freedom requires tolerance for differences and diversity. Labor looks at diversity as a strength
creativity, exchange of experience and contacts with other countries and cultures. It is a strength for us
as individuals and for businesses. It is a resource for economic wealth creation and cultural
development. If we succeed with integration, we are stronger in the age of globalization.
All will meet with expectations and given the opportunity to contribute to society and participate in the community.
We must succeed with integration. It is a responsibility that minority and majority population must
share. Responsibility rests on a consensus on the equal rights and obligations. Language is the key in
integration policy. For most people, education and employment entrance to the Norwegian community.
When society becomes more diverse, it must be clear on its foundation. Our foundation is built
the common values ​​that has evolved over a long time: democracy, human rights, rule of law and equality.
Within this framework, the diversity evolve. A society's quality can be measured at the minorities'
participation in the community.
Solidarity
Nobody can completely alone. Even the strongest may need help. Solidarity's willingness unity and expression
for a sense of responsibility. It is a prerequisite for freedom.
A solidary community support and care for those who need help. Solidarity appears in the way
to solving the major tasks. In a modern society comes the solidarity expressed through good
community solutions that ensure everyone's safety and freedom.
Prioritization of tax cuts rather than welfare weakens collective solutions. If basic
welfare services is made dependent on the market, it can weaken the support of the welfare society
because it could undermine the public interest community has in the Dutch treat. We believe collaboration is
a more important prerequisite for development than competition. Welfare involves basic set about
human relationships. We do not want to let the market determine human relations.
An active and developed civil society
There is a close correlation between high social capital and an active and developed civil society. The
Civil society plays an important role in solving the tasks the government can not or should solve
alone. Volunteering developed in the community, close to people's lives. It solves the important tasks
the gap between the various public and private offerings.
NGOs and social entrepreneurship can counteract loneliness and social exclusion on
better ways than the public.
Social democracy is boundlessly
Labour's fundamental values ​​of freedom, solidarity and equal opportunities do not stop at
borders. We want a global welfare society founded on active states which all have social security,
work and ability to support themselves and their own. Democratic rights, freedom of association and
the rule of law should apply to everyone. Along with sister parties, and allies around the world will
we work for an international community that is characterized by these ideas. We will contribute to Europe goes
foremost in this effort.

Labor wants supranational solutions at supranational challenges. We will have a
international society that is dynamic and international rules that apply to all countries. When
people exposed to abuse, it is not an internal affair of the state. We will build on
international law and wants the UN in the management of international cooperation based on principles of law and
representative, effective institutions. Such a system must have sanctions, so that it can provide
enforce its demands.
A society in ecological balance
Solidarity with future generations means that we do not cause those who come after us
social, economic or environmental problems. Labor will not disclose a society
indebted, unfair, contaminated or poor in natural. Precautionary Principle is therefore fundamental for
Labor.
Anthropogenic climate change is with poverty challenge of our time. The
is a global challenge requiring global solutions through international organizations
UN and EU. Norway will play an active role in this work. We must also act nationally and locally.
Addressing climate change requires social democratic community solutions. They put our solidarity on a large
try - the world's poor countries and poor populations will be hardest hit.
A social democracy for the future
The modern social democracy based on solidarity, democratic, humanistic and social criticism
basis. It has given us a society characterized by strong cohesion and high confidence among people and between
people and governments. Trust and unity are important pillars of a social contract in which everyone participates,
contributing to and benefiting the community, doing their duty and can claim their rights. Can we preserve the strength of
confidence and cohesion, it will give each one of us greater security and more freedom more.
Trust and unity are important qualities to meet the restructuring and challenging times. Therefore,
Social Democratic solutions good for solving future challenges. High social capital, ie
mutual security, is a key element when we must shape the future Norway.
We take on Norway
The modern history of Norway is closely linked to the Labour Party's history. Norway is a completely different
society than when the labor movement started its work. But our values ​​remain unchanged. A strong academic
and political movement has secured democratic reforms and fairer distribution. We have much to be
proud in Norway. But we are not satisfied. Social democracy is always an ongoing project.
Work for all is our main issue. Through work, we create value both for the individual and for
community. It provides individual freedom. Therefore, it is a measure that more are given the opportunity to contribute. To facilitate
for participation has helped boost the growing number of the workforce.
Labor is a socially critical party. Our goal is always to improve society. At the same time
we preserve and develop the strong confidence and cohesion in Norwegian society. It requires determination
political governance and the knowledge that community is still the best tool to provide all people share in
a safe and fair society.

3) Safe economic management

To ensure employment for all, we need to have a safe economic management. Norway is in a completely different situation than
most countries around us. There is reason to be proud. Norway has an open economy and we are
vulnerable to what happens in other countries.
My generation has been able to experience a strong growth in income and living standards. We must ensure that the
future generations have the strength to bear both its own and our common welfare on the back. It is
this thing called generation contract.
Johnsen, Minister of Finance

Safe economic management

Norway has an amazing good starting point. We have a well-run society, with well-educated
people, good welfare, stable framework conditions for business, and we are rich in
natural resources. Our way to create, share and live makes most of us feel good. We have much to
be proud of. Today we have record low unemployment - both historically and compared to other
countries. In addition, we record employment.
Everyday security is about having a job to go to, a wage one can live by and access to good
welfare services. Labour will pursue an economic policy that ensures low unemployment,
high employment and which facilitates securing industry's competitiveness so that we can
maintaining the value creation in the long term.
This program includes long-term goals and concrete objectives for the next four years. Where
far we come in accomplishing these goals depends both on economic development
and Parliamentary composition after the election.

Economic insecurity in the countries around us
The last few years have been marked by economic turmoil around the world. Unemployment has
clamped fast at a very high level - especially among young people. There is a risk of increased social unrest and lack
sustainability of welfare programs in many countries. The international financial turmoil will affect Europe
long time to come.
So far, Norway has fared well, but we are a small country with close economic ties to the world around
us. Two thirds of everything we produce is exported to Europe. Under the EEA Agreement, Norwegian companies can
compete on equal terms with European firms. Less trading internationally frames Norwegian industry.
A strong currency can make the problem worse, and workplaces may be endangered. Safe economic management
is essential to ensure Norwegian jobs and a competitive business environment.
The international financial crisis has confirmed that the market can not govern themselves. Labor
believes it is necessary to have political control of the financial markets through regulation that may
prevent crises and instill confidence, democratic transparency and consumer interests. Norway must support
actively involved with the rulemaking is happening internationally.
Illegal capital flight is a major problem for many countries. Openness and transparency are essential to limit
illegal capital flight, tax evasion and reveal other crimes. Norway will be a driving force in
Current international efforts for transparency and information exchange. Countries that facilitates
illegal capital flight, should meet with blacklisting and international sanctions.
Our oil and gas resources gives us huge revenues directly to the community, creating
jobs and values ​​across the country. Through the Government Pension Fund and
The guidelines do we transitory income to a perpetual wealth for us and future
generations. We who live today must meet our needs without destroying future generations
ability to meet their. Labor believes the fiscal rule - and the fact that alternating
governments over time have chosen to follow it - is the most important contribution to safe economic management in Norway.
Petroleum Revenue is no guarantee that it can not go wrong in the Norwegian economy. Many countries have
acknowledged that it is difficult to deal with revenues from natural resources without destroying the economy and the
long-term growth potential.
Labor believes management of the pension fund continued to happen in order to achieve the highest
returns subject to moderate risk to safeguard people's pensions. Labor wants the Government
Pension Fund to be among the leading funds in the world in the promotion of human rights and better
climate.
We will further develop the investment strategy for the fund with the aim of good returns
moderate risk. The fund will also be a responsible investor and build on international
recognized principles for responsible investment as the UN Global Compact, the OECD
12

guidelines for responsible business, the OECD guidelines for corporate governance and
International law. We will ensure adequate resources for socially responsible investing.
Welfare Society is a joint effort. Labor will have a tax and fee system that provides stable
benefits to the community, promote employment, equitable distribution and a better environment, and contributing to
maintaining jobs and residents in rural areas. We must have a tax level that makes it possible to
finance welfare services, while it is perceived as fair and equitable.
Good distribution is not just about fairness, but also means a lot for economic development, growth
and stability. A well-known aspects of economic development in the Nordic countries is that we have managed
combining economic growth and a high level of income, with a uniform distribution of the proceeds. It is a
part of the core of the Norwegian model. Good distribution is important for the economy because it allows multiple takes
education, get jobs and earn a living and thus contribute tax income and purchasing power.
The tax level overall is not increased compared to 2004, but we have redistributed by those who have large
dividends and large fortunes pay more, while those who have little pay less tax. Labor will
work for a continued broad and equitable basis for taxation. We want a tax system that is most
equitable and predictable, and regularly assess changes conducive to equitable distribution. Skatteog tax system is also pivotal in environmental and climate policy. Labor will ensure
necessary funding to strengthen control of the black economy and heavy financial crime.
Labour will:
• Ensure market through the EEA Agreement and actively work against EU bodies and safe
Norwegian companies' ability to compete on an equal footing in the European market.
• Implement the measures necessary to ensure a stable and functioning financial market.
• Follow guidelines for prudent use of oil revenues.
• Develop investment strategy for the Government Pension Fund aimed at good
return with moderate risk. The Fund shall be a responsible investor.
• Spend money so that it contributes to offsetting fluctuations in the economy.
• Keeping the overall taxes and charges at the same level as today.
• Maintain capital tax, but keep working on changes that contribute to fairer
distribution and better framework conditions for Norwegian industry.
• Have stable and competitive fiscal conditions for business.
• Develop and strengthen the use of climate and environmental fees.
• Strengthen efforts to prevent the underground economy and tax evasion, both nationally and
internationally.
• Actively work internationally against tax competition.
• Continue the local taxation law.

Decent and productive employment
Work for all is job number 1. It provides individual freedom, economic security and opportunity to use
personal abilities. Our main project is to secure existing jobs and create new ones.
It must be easier to get into the labor market and more difficult to be expelled. The workplace should have space for
anyone can contribute.
Work is also jointly. Participation and belonging strengthens trust between people and between
people and society. To preserve the security we need decent work. Strengths
organizations of employees and employers is a good protection against unserious behavior and social dumping
in the workplace. An organized labor adds value, productivity and innovation
makes the Norwegian labor market highly competitive despite the high cost. Strong and
responsible organizations in working life is an important basis for high employment. Many countries in Europe
experiencing fewer trade union itself. We see something similar in Norway. Labor will stimulate
several organizing themselves through elevation of union deduction.
Good relations between employees and employers and a central role for the coordinating
confederations is an important basis for wealth creation, distribution of goods and for the social
13

stability. The Norwegian model for cooperation and wage formation is today an integral part of
government policies on broad areas of society, and it contributes to the parties, both centrally and locally
find good solutions with a low level of conflict. As part of efforts to build party cooperation infrastructure it
important to develop institutions that labor law, the Contact Committee, the Technical Reporting Committee
Income Settlements, the Tariff Board and the National Mediation Institute.
Labor will turn ring on workers' rights. We should protect the health of workers,
security and welfare. It is fundamental in our model of society and contribute to wealth creation, growth and
innovation.
Labor want it to be easy for workers to come to Norway to use
their expertise here. It must be quick and easy for both employer and employee to get
necessary permits so that skilled labor can be retrieved. After EU enlargement, the number
migrant workers increased sharply. Labor is positive about this, but there are also challenges
Increased labor has given us important labor, but in parts of the labor market has also led
problems with social dumping. Greater movement of labor across borders with
launching of tasks put increasing pressure on the Norwegian working life model. EEA Agreement
is positive for Norway and has helped to strengthen many workers' rights in Europe and in
Norway. Labor will actively exploit the room for maneuver in the agreement, to ensure that Norway
will still have a good working life regulation. For Labour, it is important to ensure wage and
working conditions for all workers who work in Norway. We will work to ensure that new EU rules do not add
obstacles to measures that Norway has introduced or plans to introduce, for example through
NAPs against social dumping. It is particularly important to ensure wage and workers who participate
in cross-border establishment or service, and protect collective rights including
the right to strike.
The purpose of the au pair scheme is to offer cultural exchange between different countries for young people.
People who in reality are employed as a maid, must have decent wages and working conditions,
and shall not be in Norway for a residence permit as an au pair.
Social dumping means that foreign workers are exposed to violations of health, safety and
safety rules or offered wages that are unacceptably low. Collective wage agreements are an important
tools to combat social dumping. We will facilitate the general application becomes easier to take in
use. Joint and several liability which provides the principal responsibility to pay wages to subcontractors, the right of access
for officers and supervisory responsibility for principals, are important elements of the scheme and must be retained. The
must be considered whether principals who are not consumers, also be covered by joint responsibility for
lack of payment of remuneration.
Labor will continue to work arrangements that allow employees' confidence in wages and
working conditions. To correct a particular effort towards sectors that are particularly exposed to unserious and social
dumping, the Labor including developing third-party trade programs as an instrument.
In contractual relationship with long supply chains increase the risk of exploitation of workers and social
dumping. Experiences with limiting the number of terms in a contract chain must be used in several government agencies
and municipalities to combat unserious behavior and social dumping.
The number of serious accidents at work is still too high in Norwegian working life. Migrant workers and youth
are 50% more prone to serious accidents due to language barriers and lack of experience than others
workers, and therefore need increased attention and effort.
In line with social changes, also changes the workplace. New technology and an increasingly interactive
everyday makes more available for employer virtually around the clock. More work evening, night
and on weekends. It is important that both the legislation and regulations ensuring workers' rights. The rules must
be such that it should still be possible to distinguish between work and leisure. The organization of labor
also changes. Some Group organized in a way that employees do not have the same
protection of HSE regulations and lacks the right to approve the enterprise. Labor will
14

work to ensure that it should not be possible to circumvent regulations that are essential to safeguard the
wages and working conditions. Labour will therefore ensure that corporate democracy safeguarded also in
franchise chains.
Employees who work at retail outlets, are currently not covered by the provisions on night and
weekend work in the Working Environment Act. They have thus not the same legal protection as other workers and
weakened influence over their working.
Labour will initiate a review of this aimed at a comprehensive regulation
ensures workers' need for protection, involvement will and basic business principles of democracy in
different ownership structures. Opening provisions be reviewed in parallel with this, with a view to
modernization. In line with the Norwegian model is done in cooperation with the social partners
Its main purpose is to ensure the individual financial security and make it possible to combine work
and pensions or labor and social security. Pensions may constitute a significant cost difference when public
services to competition. We have for some time seen that the pension benefits to the employees coming
under pressure by tendering deployment of public services. Such a development could lead to the competitions
at the expense of the employees' wages and working conditions. Labor will consider how it can
countered that the use of tendering in the public sector weakens employees' pension conditions.
New technological systems contribute to more efficiency, but can also be used to monitor employees so
that privacy comes under pressure. Labor will work for a strengthened legislation that sets
clear limits on what should be allowed by monitoring in the workplace.
Labour, together with the social partners pursue a full-time culture in Norwegian working life and for
combating involuntary part. Employees who over time have been working more than the agreed working hours shall be entitled to
extended position percentage corresponding real working hours.
The preferential right for part-time employees in accordance with the Working Environment Act (§ 14.3) must be real.
Part-time employees who want it and are qualified, should be capable of expanding its position before it hired
new. An improved municipal finances will make it possible to increase the number of FTEs in the health care professions,
and thus also the number of full-time jobs.
The entrance to the labor market needs to be simpler and less risk of expulsion. Therefore, it is important
a powerful NAV. Early efforts, tailored events and focus on the individual skills
future job is important in meeting between NAV and users.
Labour will:
• Maintain employees' rights in the sick pay scheme.
• Strengthen the practical implementation of the inclusive workplace agreement.
• Increase efforts to prevent occupational accidents and work for a vision of zero serious accidents in the workplace
so we strive for zero vision for fatal road accidents.
• Ensure that HSE responsibilities are clearer located and cared for in long contract chains
unclear responsibilities, including looking at Client Regulations.
• Require employers about both adequate language training and facilitation of understanding of
Norwegian legislation and work culture among migrant workers.
• Strengthen efforts to combat social dumping and promote new initiatives in a third action plan.
• Strengthening Labour Inspection and PSA through improved measures and effective enforcement of
regulations.
• Secure collective litigation rights for unions by leasing.
• In cooperation with the parties ensure that we have a well-functioning general scheme that measures against
social dumping.
• Have a more equal Norway, and change the work environment law so that a statutory right to an extended position
part-time workers, the rights of part-time employees and the introduction of consultation with employee representatives on duty
use of part-time positions.
• Ensure that employees who over time have been working more than the agreed working hours is entitled to an extended post.
15

• Ensure that regular and direct employment still being the main rule in Norwegian working life, and that the use of
hiring as far as possible be limited to the use of real temps and seasonal peaks.
• Ensure compliance with the equal treatment principle using hiring. Those who are hired must have
at least as good wages and working conditions as if they were employed directly by the hirer.
• That workers and their organizations should have ample opportunity to participate in determining
of unsociable hours, such as night work.
• Ensure employees' rights in mergers, tender releases and where
activities are organized as franchises.
• Consider an extended HSE responsibility in corporate and franchise conditions.
• Making it easier for foreign workers to use their expertise in the Norwegian labor market.
• Using leeway in the EEA actively to safeguard workers' rights.
• Raising union deduction and develop tripartite cooperation between governments,
workers 'and employers' organizations.

Gender equality
Equality means that opportunities and rights you have in society, not determined by gender.
Labor is proud that Norway is on top of the world when it comes to equality, and that Norwegian women
can combine it to be in jobs with relatively high birth rate in the European context. Yet it
tasks that remain to ensure equality.
Women's participation in the labor market is crucial for the growth potential of the Norwegian economy. Increased female
participation laid the foundation for the wonderful prosperity we have enjoyed since the end of
60's. Norway currently has high labor force participation among women. Well 73 percent of Norwegian women aged
15-64 years were employed in 2010 - more than 16 percentage points above the OECD average.
Until today, we have reached many of the family's political objectives that we know contribute to increased gender equality.
Now we have the greatest focus on the major gender equality policy challenges that still exist in today
Employment. Key challenges ahead is to secure equal pay and to facilitate more women to
working full-time. In addition, efforts to combat domestic violence constantly have priority.
Gender equality equal opportunities for both sexes. The largest gender equality challenges
forward applies to women, but also men experience equality challenges, partly because they
less than mothers have contact with their children after a breakup, more boys than girls
concludes secondary education without conducting, and men have a shorter life expectancy and tops
crime statistics. We are not finished with equality before men and women have the same freedom of choice
and the same opportunities.
Labour will:
• Cooperate with the social partners on development and measures to promote equality
workplaces.
• Improve knowledge of the reasons for women's absence.
• Work together with the social partners for equal pay and for more women to work full time.
• Set targets that 40% of the leaders at the top levels of government should be women.
• The state-owned companies should have recruitment strategies to increase the number of women in
corporate management to reach a goal of at least 40% of both sexes in the lead.
• Targeted use scheme with additional points for education for the underrepresented sex, in
combination with other recruitment measures, including the use of the scheme in several studies where it is
get boys.

Management of a new era
The public sector is to its citizens. It should give us all great services, choice and
codetermination. A strong public sector is a prerequisite for equality and equal conditions for all.
For us it is important to renew and reorganize the public sector so that it becomes more efficient and better for
users. Our employees are our most important resource to achieve this.

16

Our goal is the best possible services to all the people, regardless of who you are, your background, where you live or
wallet size. A strong and modern public sector offering good, efficient services,
is the most important instrument for achieving this goal. Resources community spends on welfare, should
go to the best possible quality of services. The quality is affected by the working conditions of the
staff. Labor would not tender processes there are competitions on employee wages and
working conditions. On core areas such as health, education and care for the elderly should be good public offerings
encompassing all. How we organize this offer depends on what is best for the citizens.
Basic welfare services should not be privatized or commercialized.
Nonprofit and other private welfare providers a useful supplement to the public offer. A multitude of
methods, innovation and creativity will contribute to further development of services. Many ideal
actors have long experience, expertise and commitment, and can both contribute new solutions
and be a driving force for development in the public offer. Social entrepreneurs can bring with it
experiences and perspectives that will supplement and renew the public offer.
Norwegian government is functioning and ranks among the best in the world. Labor will constantly
help to improve and enhance the services available to all. Labor want users
and services should be in focus and will go through critical reporting requirements, rules and procedures
contribute to unnecessary bureaucratic micromanagement going on quality loose. Labor is
strongly committed to reduce the extent of temporary employment and use of consultants, as this may
weaken workers' rights, participation and the public opportunities to develop good
competence of our own staff.
Managers at all levels of government must work systematically to strengthen their own and
organizational attitudes and culture related to risk awareness, implementation capacity, collaboration,
ICT utilization and results-oriented leadership. It is a work that will take time and require a willingness to change
all levels. It will be mandatory to better coordination, a more effective management and leadership that is willing
to listen and learn from those who are in the front line and knows the weaknesses and strengths.
Labor will improve and enhance public services so that they are easily accessible for everyone. Good
Incentives are important to ensure that we use community resources in an efficient and effective way, where creative
employee participation and competent, inclusive leadership is central. Trust between enterprising
employees and management are essential to improving the management and promotion of the population. Check, and reporting procedures must be appropriate, in order to promote efficiency and better solutions, avoid
misuse of community resources and combating corruption. The use of market principles in the public sector
shall be justified in that it will improve services for the benefit of all and not weaken workers
rights.
Labor want people to have a good experience in their encounters with public services. We will
simplify life for those who receive services and for those who work with services in the public sector.
Management shall adopt digital services. Norwegians are quick to put them to use. Then you do not
public sector lag behind.
Management should be open, accessible and properly communicate in a clear and understandable manner.
Digitization of public sector provides better, more coordinated and faster services. Simultaneously
community resources so that more can be used for the care and welfare. By offering self-service solutions
freed resources can be used to provide better personal support where needed. Availability trades
also that the individual of us can understand the nature of the service we use. Among other things, it is about
that most people understand, purely linguistic, what's in the public information and forms.
Labour will:
• Working for a public sector that is concerned with service and individual meetings each
capita.
• The online services should be the general rule for the administration's communication with
citizens.

17

• Simplify legislation as ordinary people, organizations and businesses often meet, with
aimed at saving the individual to unnecessary time and expenses, including through a
tripartite cooperation.
• Carrying simplification of control and reporting regime in public administration.
• That the use of a more overarching and clear statement of objectives to reduce retail management in one
Another mission documents.
• Develop a better culture for employee involvement.
• Establish better routines for spreading knowledge about "best practices" in all parts of the public sector.
• Develop strategies for the purchase and use of consultants in the public sector. Upon purchase and use of
consulting services to public sector agencies, shall upon entry into the larger
consultancy agreements in general rule also agreed transfer of knowledge to the public
business.
• Leveraging public resources better through coordination of government procurement.
• Simplify procurement regulations and have flexible rules for the procurement of health and
social services.
• At state and municipal autonomous entities in procurements require apprenticeships where
is relevant trades.
• Have a good and ongoing dialogue with nonprofit sectors with a view to developing adequate welfare services for
future.
• The ideal actors will be a supplement to the public offer. These should be predictable
conditions, and contracts' length must ensure individuals and organizations quality
opportunity to invest.

Vibrant democracy
Labor believes that the individual should have control over their own lives. It's about participating
in democracy by voting in elections, but also about the impact on the workplace, in the community,
at school and in the face of the public. Freedom of choice and participation must be a fundamental
objective. Employee opportunity participation must be strengthened for the corporate and statutory and
contractual participation must be real.
Low turnout is a democratic challenge. Labor believes it is an important political goal
increase participation. Therefore, local democracy is perceived as significant, and local elected officials
must have influence over and responsibility for the issues that matter in people's everyday lives. It must also be
easy to cast their votes at elections.
Democracy also manages minority interests. Public consultation, impact assessment and other
processes ensure that different opinions and interests emerge. At the same time it contributes to the decisions taking
time. Labor will simplify and shorten the planning process, while taking account of the possibility that
different interests are heard.
Transparency, access to information and freedom of expression are key elements in a democracy. Professional
media companies with integrity, a width of values ​​and competent journalists are essential for ensuring that
the media fails to fulfill its important social mission.
Media reality is today in extreme development. Internet and the digital reality changing people
media habits, competitive conditions in the market and the media's method of producing
and distribute their products. Labor believes that media policy must help ensure
media pluralism and quality journalism. With a reality that is rapidly changing, we must also continually
Consider the instruments of media policy and whether these work properly and ensure the media's important
social role and objectives of media policy.
The digital revolution offers new opportunities for rapid, inexpensive dissemination and reuse of text and
images. It is important that in this situation made agreements and regulations that ensure rights to own
Copyright and decent use agreements for journalists and photographers.

18Labour will:
• Implement initiatives that increase the influence of students in the school and to the users of public services.
• Review the electoral law in order to give parties locally greater opportunity to choose how many they
To preview cumulate.
• Encourage municipalities to implement two-day election.

4) Knowledge Society

As teaching jobs eg every day with those who will shape Norway in the future. I see therefore how important it is to
ensure a good education for our ungane, right from the kindergarten by education.
Pupils must complete and pass education say to get good possibilities in the labor market. We must help
pupils to well correct line for education, and this must dei help tidleg during training. No thriving
as well at school as Norwegian pupils, and this we shall take care of. Aloud fråver is still a problem in the
Secondary school. We must therefore ask stronger requirement that pupils must be to constantly in teaching,
where the best learning takes place: in a collective.

We are building the future of knowledge-Norway
Norway's most important resource is the people who live here. It is knowledge, creativity, and creativity that
enables us to solve tomorrow's tasks. Therefore, the Labour big ambitions for
Norway's knowledge.
Equal right to education is fundamental to reduce social inequalities and give everyone the opportunity to adopt
their abilities. All our knowledge reforms have acted to ensure people access to good and free education
with high quality. We have ambitions on behalf of all children. What background you should not settle
what opportunities you have in life.
We do not know anything about the future, but we know that knowledge and skills are crucial for Norway to
success also in the future. There will always be countries that can offer goods and services cheaper than Norway.
Our competitive advantage must therefore act otherwise. We must be the best of knowledge, innovation,
restructuring and technology. How can Norway still succeed better than other countries.
Labor will have a knowledge policy where we do what we know works, and that is based on leading
national and international research. It is a key measure to strengthen the quality and increase the diversity of the whole
Norway's knowledge. We therefore need a more comprehensive and coherent knowledge policy where they
different parts of the education system are compatible. Then it becomes easier and more flexible to
build on and move between different programs.
We must succeed in creating tomorrow's jobs. Norwegian school will use the best of new
technology to promote knowledge, education and vocational training. We will ensure better exchange of experience
between schools and educational institutions and bring forth "best practices" -eksempler. Therefore, we will strengthen
Entrepreneurship competence throughout the education system, including through binding cooperation
between educational institutions and the workplace.

Safe and good start for all
With our policy we have reached a historic goal full coverage. We have introduced a maximum price
which has made kindergarten significantly cheaper. A safe daycare means that children can experience
play, socialization and coping with peers, while Norwegian families have increased their ability to
combine work and family.
Kindergarten should be a safe and accessible offerings that develop children's innate curiosity and
explore. In order to follow up every single child in a good way, it is important that there is enough
adults in kindergarten, and that most of these have relevant education. We will facilitate that
kindergarten employees can increase their formal competence and strengthen the possibility that they may take
preschool education while they are working. We will ensure the quality of both educators and more
several children's and youth workers in kindergarten. We will also have more social expertise into
kindergarten. Through better cooperation between kindergarten and school, we help our youngest get a
best possible foundation for further learning.
We know that differences arise early. Therefore, the kindergarten is important to make sure to provide early support to those
need it and make sure all children get a good base. In kindergarten, children learn that we are different,
and how to handle inequality. All kindergartens must have an active anti-bullying work, and ensure that
children learn to socialize with adults and each other in a good way.
The development of kindergartens will continue. In the years up to 2020, the Labor promise quality
in kindergartens, while we gradually will ensure that those children who are born after September 1st
fit in kindergarten from the age of one year.
Labour will:
• Continue efforts for a quality lift in the nursery by increasing the skills of the staff and
by getting more skilled in kindergartens. We will have more teachers and eliminate the possibility of lasting
exemption from the educational requirements for teachers and teaching staff.
22

• By 2020, implement a staffing norm that ensures enough adults in the nursery. Norm must
designed in close contact with the municipal sector, and so grow density in the nursery is about
at current levels.
• Continue to expand the number of kindergarten places so that the right to a kindergarten place for year-olds
are gradually expanded. It will during the parliamentary period introduced a minimum requirement of two admission
year to daycare.
• Defend maximum price scheme and demands for price reductions.
• As Managing public and private kindergartens, and ensure that public grants and parental fees
The children will benefit. Once one has achieved full equality, it should also, as a rule
set as requirements for daycare, for example in terms of admission criteria.
• Provide free half-day kindergarten place in several areas of living challenges and extend the offer
to include several 3-year-olds.
• Develop a quality online portal that can give parents information about quality improvement in
daycare.

• The daycare has safe and stimulating outdoor areas for play and socialization.
• Give parents more influence and real participation in kindergarten.
• Recruit more men to kindergartens and ensure gender equality based on that all children should
have equal opportunities, regardless of gender.
• Discontinue cash benefits in the next parliamentary term. Families who have applied for kindergarten, you
receive cash benefit from parental leave ends to kindergarten offered.

Labor has ambitions on behalf of all children
Knowledge and quality should govern school policy. To reach Labour's goal of equal
opportunities for all, nothing is more important than a good school looks like and follow up each pupil.
Through early intervention, clear learning objectives and more customized training, the common school help provide
all children and young people an opportunity to succeed. It is still too great social and geographical differences.
Efforts are needed so that we effectively provide a public school, with equal opportunities for all.
All people are unique. We have different talents and we learn in different ways. Pupils shall meet
with clear expectations, and the school must ensure that each gets something to strive for. Therefore,
Labour will develop a more active, varied and adapted school day for learning and mastering.
Labor has a broad view of knowledge, and will attend school wide social mandate.
In public school meet children and young people from different walks of life. The social community and
cooperation that occurs in public school, helping to prepare students for active and democratic
participation in an increasingly diverse society and working life. It is a force that Norwegian schools contributes
to counteract divisions and contradictions in society. Therefore Labor prevent the privatization of
school and defend, strengthen and renew public school. Labor would emphasize that, in line with
Private Schools Settlement between AP, KrF, SV and SP will take account of the public school structure,
the need for school and assess the seriousness of the applicant when considering applications for the establishment of
private schools.
International surveys confirm that the Norwegian pupils read, write and count better than before.
Yet we must be improved to ensure that all pupils leave primary school with good basic
skills. It is crucial that students feel safe and mastery especially during the first years of school.
To establish the foundation for good work habits, further education and conscious choice. Students must have
opportunity to express themselves in different ways, both theoretical, practical, physically and aesthetically.
We have invested heavily in Norway on investments in information and communication technology (ICT), but
not corresponding to the development and procurement of digital teaching aids. With smart digital learning materials are
it is much easier to adapt teaching and training to the individual student's academic mastery level.
Teaching on each student's level will make school rewarding for everyone, even for those who either are
ahead or behind the rest of the class. It will also free up time for teaching for teachers.

23

Ungdomsskolen
Research shows that students' motivation are lowest in secondary schools. Introduction of electives and more
practical school is welcomed by students and teachers. Labor will continue to focus on
secondary schools, including through more choice, greater cooperation with the labor market and better
transitions to secondary education. We will give students greater opportunity to immerse themselves in subjects after
own interests and aptitudes. We will give secondary schools greater opportunity to develop their own
profile, theme schools. In such a profile can research centers and key enterprises in the community be
partners who can contribute with interesting learning arenas, exciting challenges
students and supplying teaching new skills. The phasing of new technologies for knowledge,
educational development and customized training, we will modernize secondary schools.
Matt Lift
To meet future needs for expertise we will conduct a special matt lift. It will be a big
demand for engineers and other science education in the coming years. The basis for getting
for choosing these programs are added through a good math teaching. We must ensure more
teachers with higher skills to meet the need for good teaching resources, and develop better and more
motivating teaching methods so that more people become engaged and interested in math. We will increase
number of hours of mathematics in secondary schools, and ensure that all provinces to facilitate that students can
specialize in science at high level.
Digital skills
Digital skills are one of the five basic skills curriculum. Digital Literacy
is the ability to relate to and to use digital tools and social media in a safe, critical
and creative way. This concerns both the knowledge, skills and attitudes and to perform
practical tasks, communicate, gather and process information. Labor will lift digital
expertise further ahead and must be developed competence for digital skills in primary schools.
Teachers and kindergarten staff must have the necessary expertise in the use of ICT in education
and dissemination of digital literacy.
Labour will:

More will carry
The right to secondary education has meant that Norway has one of the world's most educated populations.
Projections show that the demand for unskilled labor would be significantly reduced in the years ahead.
Therefore, it is critical to ensure that as many as possible complete and pass upper secondary education. This requires
efforts throughout their school life.
Labor will have an education system that is flexible, and where one can build on its
skills throughout life. More must complete vocational education and obtain a certificate
to meet future skills needs. Then we need more apprenticeships, and to ensure that anyone who
entering a vocational education have the opportunity to finish it too if it is not possible to get
25

apprenticeship. We will also expand opportunities to move forward with relevant higher education for those
has obtained a certificate.
Labor wants to facilitate that several counties establish new facilities for pupils who choose
study specialization in general studies, where tuition is connected closer to the labor market. Through
emphasizing entrepreneurship, using the workplace as a learning arena and use a project-based
working this could provide practical, diverse and relevant disciplines related to local
competence. Folk high schools are for many an important addition to education.

More and better teachers
We must have good teachers to ensure quality in schools. Labour will therefore ensure that municipalities
can hire more and better teachers. We will arrange for continuing education in the workplace - and through a
status boost help recruit talented and motivated young people to the teaching profession.
Municipalities and counties have employer responsibility for teachers. A prerequisite for better
teacher density and more continuing education is therefore that municipal finances are good. It helps
small with national initiatives unless municipalities and counties have the money to follow up.
Municipalities must therefore be able to fulfill their employer responsibilities, and ensure that teachers
always have the proper qualifications. High teacher density is important for those students who have the greatest
monitoring needs. Municipalities must have freedom of action to direct resources to the schools that need
it most.
Labour will:
• Give teachers the confidence and support to be positive leaders and professionals.

Norwegian universities and colleges have world-leading education in priority areas. Therefore,
the need for better labor and specialization in higher education.
The role of universities and colleges play in development and education to professional occupations is very
important. The same is the practice-related research, particularly in key welfare areas.

27

Lifelong learning
We educate people today to solve the challenges we still do not know. Globalization entails
increasingly rapid changes in the labor market, and future technology will impose stringent requirements on restructuring and
Continuing Education. Therefore, we need to acquire knowledge throughout their lives. Labour will therefore ensure
to ensure opportunities for lifelong learning and more competence in all aspects of labor and
society. With new knowledge shall the land be built on.
Vocational colleges represents an important education designed in close contact with the employers. Scope and
Content in college offer must be designed to the actual need, and the funding needs
be reviewed.

Research and development. New knowledge contributes to better life for individuals and new opportunities for
existing and future businesses. Research is essential for solving new tasks, and comprehensive
technology and knowledge are essential to ensure sustainable development and a society
covering human basic needs. As a resource-rich, stable country with highly educated
population, Norway has a responsibility to contribute to technological breakthroughs in the areas where we have
can.
Research Universities and colleges are the most important institutions for research and higher
education in Norway. Norway will be a leading force in the development of knowledge, and realize the goal
to have world-leading expertise in the areas where we have a comparative advantage. Access to
class scientific equipment is of vital importance that Norway also in the future will be
a leading knowledge nation.
Norwegian research groups and companies related to the maritime sector, oil / gas, and fisheries / aquaculture, has made
Norway one of the world's leading knowledge nations in ocean space technology. Our advantages within
this area needs to be developed with future-oriented infrastructure and laboratories to ensure future
value creation and growth linked to Norway's vast marine resources, but also to contribute kunnskapsog technology to solve the world's major challenges related to food, climate and energy.
In some areas we are researching to solve specific tasks, while other areas will understand
the world around us. Together, this can create new innovation that brings society forward.
Therefore, the Labour both strengthen applied research and basic research, and facilitate the
research institutions may have closer cooperation with charitable foundations and business, also on
funding of research.

28

Norway is completely dependent on being part of the international knowledge. We need
internationally visible and strong knowledge institutions. In a country with many small businesses, it is important
Having environments for applied research that can deliver high quality research to all business sectors.

Active industrial policy
Work for all is Labour's most important goals. Wealth creation is the basis of welfare. Therefore,
Labor pursue an active industrial policy, which paves the way for an innovative, knowledge-based
and eco-friendly businesses. Norwegian businesses are facing increasing international competition. Norway to
not meet this competition with lower wages and pressure on workers' rights. We must meet
competition by concentrating on knowledge and expertise so that we can create new and better products and
organize production better.
As a small country with an open economy, we may not be the best in everything, but we are investing, we can be best in some
areas. Norway must invest strategically in those areas where we have particular prerequisites for success,
where we have particular expertise and where we have strong business clusters to build on - among other things
to be a leader in seafood, maritime activities, petroleum, energy, environmental technology and tourism.
We now see a clear tendency towards dichotomy of economy, where the activity on the Norwegian shelf is high while
as traditional export businesses struggling with low demand, a strong krone and a high cost.
There is also a clear geographical division of Norwegian industry, where it develops strong geographic
imbalance with regard to growth advantages of Norwegian businesses. Labor is concerned that some
29

regions are lagging behind in the development of a strong private sector. Active industrial policy and a clear willingness
to invest in the various regions' growth opportunities will be crucial, and how we handle these
challenges will be of great significance for the economic development forward. Labor will have a
own domestic strategy to meet the challenges the industry and geographic dichotomy of
Norwegian economy entails.
A future-oriented industry lays the foundation for tomorrow's jobs. We will build up
under and further developing the strong business and expertise we have around the country. It is also
Another goal is to attract more foreign investors. We will further develop arenas as industry clusters,
business parks and incubators to facilitate both national and international cooperation in
sector.
The Norwegian population has a high level of education. Investment in education, industrial research and
competence is important in Labour's industrial policy. Labor accounts for over 70 percent
of the national wealth. Investments in the workforce expertise provides major benefits, both for the individual
and for society.
A highly skilled, organized and decent work is a competitive advantage that allows
Norwegian workers are among those that create the most per hour worked in the world. The Norwegian
social model, with strong and responsible trade unions, organized employers and an engaged
State is important for Norwegian growth. Negotiation Solutions, security and small differences make Norway a good
country to operate in. Labour will defend this.
Through innovation and entrepreneurship should be plenty of future jobs created.
Labour believes the government must facilitate that people who have good ideas for new businesses and
concepts, should get done their ideas into reality.
Labor will work actively to make life easier for small and medium-sized enterprises.
The aim is that Norway will be one of the easiest countries to start and run their own business. We will continue
setting new forenklingsmål to reduce administrative burdens for businesses, and have systematically
follow-up to achieve these goals. An important part of the simplification effort is a continued focus on
electronic solutions to help businesses and individuals.
Labour will pursue targeted at the public support system, Innovation Norway
(IN), Siva and Research, so it works overall, is accurately and gets better and easier
to use than today. Labor will continue its efforts to simplify application procedures and increase
user-friendliness in the public funding agencies. Labor will facilitate the early establishment, with such grants, loans, mentoring and networking.
A long-term and professional ownership in business is important. Labor believes that government should be
a major shareholder in strategically important parts of Norwegian industry. As owner, the state shall be active, long-term,
professional and predictable. Labor will have a state ownership to help ensure that important
Businesses and competence retained and further developed in Norway. In strategically important companies there
essential that headquarters will remain in Norway. Labor will ensure public ownership of our common
energy resources and petroleum deposits. Companies that have the state as owner, should be leading in
CSR work both in Norway and abroad.
Labour believes that public capital both should be to facilitate innovation and
startups. We will continue to assess the need for capital in the state investment companies Investinor
and Argentum. Labour will therefore strengthen state ownership.
An extensive government ownership is an important contribution to the good business development in Norway. The state
ownership shall be managed on an active, dynamic and professional manner, in which a long-term, predictable
and social responsibility is the hallmark of a strategy for increased value creation, industrial development and safe
jobs. We will contribute capital to state-owned companies where it makes sense for value creation
and future-oriented jobs. In strategically important companies, it is crucial that the headquarters will be
remain in Norway. Labor will maintain the extent of government ownership at about today
30

level. The State must contribute to strategic ownership in a forward-looking industry. State capital should not be a
rescue plank for enterprises that have not been able to adapt or are not competitive.
Future businesses springs from the business world we have today. Competence in the maritime sector was
a prerequisite for the oil and gas industry succeeded. Today, exports of technology, knowledge
and products in the supply industry has grown bigger than the market in Norway. By betting where we are
good, we simultaneously foundation for germination and innovation in adjacent industries. Some
traditional industries, such as mining and quarrying industry, is about to find new market opportunities. Simultaneously
we also need to invest in new areas, such as nanotechnology and marine bioprospecting.
The service sector is a large and growing part of the economy. Labor will contribute to this
sector can be strengthened by innovation and quality. The retail industry is for example moving into
an innovation leap, where technology will be critical for the industry's further development.
Manufacturing has been and is an important prerequisite for Norway to be a leader in
creativity and innovation and thus value creation. Modern industry has high added value. Norway has
good conditions for høgteknologisk industry, with major investments, expertise and active
product development and marketing. For Labour, the goal is that Norwegian raw materials are processed
in Norway. We will build knowledge and adaptability. Labor will facilitate the
Norwegian industrial expertise to a greater extent can be used to test new technology, and believes that many of
the traditional industrial sites will have special qualifications to exploit such opportunities.
Kraftforedlende industry are located in rural Norway, and has been developed thanks to good access
environmentally friendly energy. The industry has always been good in restructuring, environment and technology.
Labor will further develop businesses that are world leaders in expertise,
work environment, innovation, climate and energy-efficient production. CO2 compensation scheme will
continued.
Norway is the world's fifth largest shipping nation and has one of the world's most complete maritime
industrial clusters. Labor wants Norway to be the world's leading nation in maritime
expertise and innovation. We will therefore continue to develop the maritime industry so that it can deliver the
most innovative and environmentally friendly solutions. Labor will the development of educational programs on
higher level both in technical and administrative sciences that provide the world's leading maritime skills.
This presupposes the accumulation of any particular strong academic environment.
Labor believes that Norway must take the initiative for a global agreement so that it no longer be given special
tax relief for shipping. Until agreement has been reached about such an agreement must Norwegian shipping nutrient
leading position and Norwegian seafarers jobs secured through conditions that are equal
with competitors. Labor will continue and strengthen net wage scheme for seafarers.
Norway is a country with rich mineral resources, as insufficiently mapped. There are great opportunities
add significant value in the mineral industry. The objective must be that as much as possible of Norwegian
mineral resources processed in this country.
The tourism industry is one of the world's fastest growing industries, and Norway has the best natural
prerequisites to take its share of the international growth. Labour's vision is that we through
providing valuable experiences will create value for visitors, business, community and
community. The tourism industry is an important industry which has great potential for further
value creation. The industry must shift from just producing traditional tourism products to cooperate
to create holistic experience products that include culture, food, history, nature and activities,
addition to transport and accommodation.
Labour will:
• Lead an active industrial policy that facilitates and strengthens Norwegian business competitiveness.
• Bet on the areas where we have special conditions to be good, such as petroleum,
energy and environment, tourism, marine and maritime sectors, including through investment in research and
development.
31

• Establish a strategy for land-based industries.
• Say no to the sale of strategically important interests in companies such as Statoil and the partial privatization or
sale of Statkraft and Statnett.
• Continue the scheme with CO2 compensation for industry electricity prices.
• At companies with the state as owner should take responsibility both locally, regionally, nationally and
internationally.
• Ensuring access to capital through grants for seed capital and establishing scholarship
entrepreneurs.
• Assess whether the state in some cases can help with long-term shareholder capital
• The funding agencies should meet companies' needs, and have a special focus on small and
medium-sized enterprises.
• Simplify corporate social reporting requirements through a continuous simplification work.
• Simplify and stimulate small businesses the opportunity to participate in tender processes by drafting more
standard contracts.
• Work to ensure that more women establish and develop businesses through monitoring
Action Plan for more entrepreneurship among women.
• Facilitate research and innovation in large employment sive industries such as transport,
retail and construction.
• The funding agencies will actively contribute to investments in new tourism attractions and develop new
destinations.
• Further develop the tourism industry with a focus on quality and marketing of Norway abroad.
• Stimulate economic activity at the intersection of culture and industry.
• Further develop the maritime industry with a focus on research and innovation aimed at developing
more environmentally friendly solutions.
• Secure a competitive net wage by raising the ceiling of the scheme and legislate today
scheme.
• Facilitate future value creation through increased development and use of Norwegian environmental technology.
• Develop a progressive mineral industry with focus on mapping and competence.
• Ensure a regulatory framework for alcohol advertising as equally treats like actors. It should be opened for so-called
generic mention and pictures of alcoholic products at manufacturers and suppliers
sites with information on different product type characteristics and the kind of drink that fits
what types of food.
• Maintain a holistic actors and media-neutral prohibition of alcohol. Within
this framework study the possibility to open also for sober product information directly from
producers to consumers, the information platforms that consumers must actively seek out.

Energy Norway Norway
Norway is an energy nation. Natural resources we possess has given us a unique opportunity, and we have managed
them in such a way that the community has received income from them, and still largely ownership
to these resources. We have a higher proportion of renewable energy than most countries in the world, and our
production of oil and gas are being pursued with the strictest HSE and environmental requirements in the world. We want to use
our expertise in energy to develop tomorrow's jobs.
Energy is both an input in business activity and an important industry in itself. Energy policy
should help to facilitate increased value in energy production and in kraftforedlende industry.
Energy and economic development are closely linked. Labor will continue to work to ensure
security of supply in Norway, by focusing on the production of renewable energy and development
of the power grid - both in Norway and between Norway and abroad. Labour would ensure faster
processing in networks and production matters. The public ownership of hydropower resources must
ensured.
Terms revisions of old hydropower concessions must be made so that the overall environmental impact
from Norwegian power production becomes less. Local communities' interests must be safeguarded as well as today also
in the new hydropower licenses. Labor is open for a gentle upgrade and development

32

Hydropower where this does not lead to major disturbances to the environment and loss of biodiversity in line with current
regulations.
Norway is a major producer of renewable energy. At the same time we have we have a huge potential to
increase production further. We will increase investment in renewable energy sources and strengthen the
research on renewable energy. We will use the unique expertise we have on energy
creating future technology.
Energy savings are both good climate policy, good energy policy and good business policy. Labor
will include follow up climate message so that building requirements of the technical regulation being passive level
in 2015 and almost zero energy level in 2020. Labour wants to facilitate energy-positive buildings.
Labor will continue to use Enova as a tool for increased energy efficiency.
Labour will:
• Attend reversion institute and still ensure a strong public ownership of hydropower resources,
in that they are owned by the public with minimum 2/3 and that only companies with a minimum of 2/3
public ownership that can make new concessions.
• Further increase processing capacity and processing rate in NVE and OED.
• View grid and production in the context of the licensing issues, and ensure that applications for networks and
production projects in the same area treated in context.
• Work as uniform electricity as possible across the country given the Energy Act, production and
network development.
• Continue to upgrade the power grid in Norway.
• Ensuring a reasonable cost allocation for investments in the network, and assess whether there is a
appropriate method of introducing a construction in meshed networks.
• Building economically viable transmission lines between Norway and abroad.
• Using the opportunities that excess power gear to help balance the production of wind energy and
other variable energy sources in Europe.
• The Norwegian hydropower tradition continues in that community who are holding their
natural resources for hydropower generation, get a part of the tax revenues. Intervention
in the natural environment should be done with understanding and acceptance from affected communities and allowing parts of
revenues accrue to local communities also changed technology for exploitation of hydropower.
• Provide both for environmental and power generation in the revision of previously granted
hydropower licenses.
• Researching more on renewable energy development.
• Support major demonstration projects in renewable energy, within the framework of the new
climate and technology fund.
• Providing subsidies to encourage energy efficiency in public and private buildings and
households.
• Continue the strengthening of Enova as a tool in the pursuit of energy efficiency and
energy conversion.
• Continue efforts to increase energy efficiency in industry.
• Aim to increase the use of power from shore on the Norwegian shelf, where it is economically viable and it
sufficient electrical power is available.
• Continued focus on capturing and storing CO2. All licenses granted for gas power remains unchanged. New
licenses will be based on CO2 capture.

Oil and gas
Labour's petroleum policy is based on the oil and gas resources belong to the community, and that
economic rent (the extra profitability in the industry) shall be restored to the community. Labor
want the Norwegian petroleum activities shall be based on the all times best of knowledge,
experiences and technology, and the world's most stringent environmental requirements.
The management of the seas should be based on an integrated ecosystem-based approach. Consideration
to fishing interests should be given considerable weight.

33

Labor will facilitate continued high activity and value creation from the petroleum activities
through improved recovery from producing fields and through old and new discoveries are put into production.
Through license awards in numbered rounds and annual awards in mature areas (APA) we will
stimulate exploration activities. Along with opening new areas of petroleum, these
strategies mitigate the drop in oil and gas production and ensure that skills are safeguarded and that we get
term value creation and income from our petroleum resources.
Labor will facilitate the development of petroleum activities in the north and open to
exploration activities in the areas close to the new border with Russia that were previously contested, if
EIA for the area warrant.
Labor advocates that it carried out an impact assessment of petroleum activity
unopened parts of Nordland 6 and in fields Nordland and Troms 7 2.
An acceptance of an environmental impact assessment does not imply that the areas opened for such business. The question of
a possible opening of areas to be treated by the Congress in 2015. Environmental considerations should
emphasized in an assessment of a possible opening of areas.
As industry developed into new areas, these areas also drawn into the
supplier operations so that the industry creates new local spin-offs as it moves north.
As much as ripple is about what we demand of the oil companies, so it's also about
how we put a region able to create and utilize ripple when the industry is going.
Labor will focus on skills development in the new areas of activity and take measures to
increase the availability of personnel. We will work to ensure that the industry develops contract forms that facilitate
for the local providers in the competition for contracts.
Norwegian supply industry has forty years built itself up to be competitive and
internationally leading within offshore oil and gas activities. This development has been stimulated
of politically approved schemes such as the requirement for national content in the early years and support
R & D. Labor will continue to pursue R & D programs, and other industrial policy instruments
contributes to continued technology edge and competitiveness for this entire industry.
Through upgrades and new construction will Labor facilitate a temporal physical infrastructure
which is necessary for development of petroleum activities in the north. Meanwhile, Labor help
that industry profitably develop the production-related infrastructure as carrier and
LNG facility in such a way that it also supports the interests of the local repercussions.
Within existing environmental and climate policies and within the framework of commercial profitability, will
Labor facilitate increased value in that gas to a greater extent also be used for domestic
- Also in connection with other business activities. Use of gas in Norway must take place within our
international climate commitments.
Labor will intensify work on the development of environmental technology in the petroleum industry and
ensure that the skills developed in the petroleum sector, also play a useful role in development
within other industries. With our maritime background, Norway has great potential in the development of
technology for offshore wind power, and we will pursue.
Labour will:
• Facilitate the old and new discoveries are put into production and for improving recovery from producing
fields, where it is profitable for society.
• Through license awards stimulate exploration in both mature areas and in promising new
areas.
• Open new areas for petroleum activities.
• Ensure that measures are taken due regard to environmental and fisheries activities in the petroleum industry.
• That it be made to ensure that Norwegian gas increasingly being put to use for industrial
value creation.
34

• Work to strengthen Petoro.
• Facilitate local and regional ripple effects when petroleum activities developed in north
including through the development of expertise locally and by developing forms of contracts which make
that local providers in the competition for contracts.
• Promote research and development schemes and other economic policy measures that contribute to continued
leading edge technology and competitiveness of the petroleum-oriented supply industry.
• Promote further internationalization and export from the petroleum-related
supplier industry.

Common climate commitments for the future
The basis for Labour's climate policy is the goals we have committed ourselves in the climate report
and climate compromise between parliamentary parties. Labour's goal of climate policy is that global
emissions are reduced so that the temperature increase on Earth does not exceed 2 degrees C. According to the UN
IPCC, a temperature rise beyond this provide great and irreversible negative consequences, also in
Norway.
The climate problem is with combating hunger and poverty, among the greatest challenges
the world faces. Labor builds its policy on that everyone should have equal rights and opportunities
- Both nationally and globally. This principle must also be the basis for climate policy. Labor
therefore a long term goal that every man on earth given an equal right to emit CO2.
The climate problem can only be solved through broad and long-term international cooperation. Simultaneously
determined mostly by the specific climate policy nationally.
The main premise to solve climate problems is a strong international agreements, which
includes many countries as possible and contribute to a fair distribution of burdens and emission reductions.
Labour will seek to ensure that the UN-led climate negotiations provide a broad climate agreement
ensuring a development in line with the two-degree target. Such a development requires global emissions of
greenhouse gases are reduced by 50-85 percent until 2050. This will only be possible if emissions
reduced both in industrialized countries, emerging economies and developing countries.
At the Climate Change Conference in Durban in 2011 it was decided to seek to negotiate a broad international
climate treaty by the end of 2015. Labor believes that Norway must contribute actively and constructively in
this negotiation course with a view to reaching agreement on the most comprehensive and binding
agreement.
A new broad climate agreement will not take effect until 2020. On climate meeting in Doha in 2012 was achieved
agreed to extend the Kyoto Protocol until 2020. The second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol
however, comprises only about (10 percent) of the world's greenhouse gases. It also increases the
global emissions greatly. Global and comprehensive climate change this decade is crucial should
world achieve their climate goals.
In keeping with the climate compromise is the Norwegian climate policy is geared following
overarching goals:
• In the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period, Norway has surpassed its Kyoto commitments
by 10 percentage points.
• Norway will by 2020 undertake a commitment to cut global emissions of
greenhouse gases equivalent to 30 percent of Norway's emissions in 1990.
• Norway will be carbon neutral by 2050.
• As part of an ambitious global climate agreement in which other developed countries taking on
major commitments, Norway shall have a binding target of carbon neutrality at the latest in 2030.
implies that Norway should make emission reductions equivalent Norwegian emissions in 2030.

35

Moreover, it follows from the government's political platform, the Soria Moria II, the government will strengthen Norway
climate targets so that they correspond to cut emissions 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, if
it can contribute to agreement on an ambitious climate agreement in which the major emitting countries undertake concrete
commitments.
Labor wants Norway to increase attention to the so-called short-lived climate drivers, as
black carbon and methane. Reducing such emissions will have a faster positive climate. At the same time
these climate drivers a special big effect on melting ice. Norway must exploit its position in the Arctic
cooperation to promote measures against SLCFs.
Norway has in recent years been a leader in combating increased emissions from deforestation
and forest degradation. These efforts have contributed to several developing countries now restrict deforestation.
Norway helping to trigger large and rapid reductions in emissions. Labor would consider
reinforce this effort if it turns out that this future will be a positive tool.
An important part of the international climate work is to facilitate the private sector invests in
renewable energy in developing countries and emerging economies. Approximately 1.3 billion people today
no access to electricity and about 2.6 billion people have no access to cooking under clean
relationship. Investments in renewable energy and infrastructure contribute to reducing emissions, climate friendly
economic development and poverty reduction.
The climate problem is largely a result of the unregulated market forces and that climate hostile
behavior has a low or no cost for those who cause it. Meanwhile, market forces
utilized to propel climate-friendly technology and climate-friendly economic growth. The main
premise for a climate-friendly economic development is that it should cost to emit CO2. Subsidizing
of fossil energy is today widespread. To help ensure that a greater share of world energy production comes
from renewable sources, will Labor work to ensure that fossil subsidies be phased out and for the establishment
more and better systems for pricing greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon pricing makes investments in renewable
energy, energy efficiency and technology more profitable. Pricing of emissions from such
international air and shipping traffic helps reduce emissions and can provide funding climate.
Labor will work for comprehensive and robust international mechanisms for financing
of mitigation in poor countries. The international climate efforts in the coming years must be stepped up and
coordinated stronger through joint international regulations and common channels, such as the Green
Climate Fund. In the absence of a broad agreement, we must strengthen efforts to reduce Norwegian emissions
while also strengthening efforts to reduce emissions and climate-friendly economic development
in other countries.

An aggressive national climate policy
Norway is covered by the EU ETS. Total emissions in the ETS can only
reduced by reducing the overall quota amount. Labor will work to ensure that EU
quota system is the most effective tool, partly because the ceiling for the total emissions
reduced.
Climate policy must be oriented so that the greatest possible emission reductions for their efforts and gives
emission reductions both in Norway and abroad. Norway has long led an active national climate policy.
In addition to that about 80 per cent of Norwegian emissions have a price because they are subject to quotas or
CO2 tax, Norway spends actively regulations and provide financial support for renewable energy and climate-friendly
technology.
This policy has produced good results. This is expressed partly because emissions per
Unit (carbon intensity) in the Norwegian economy has fallen by about 36 percent over the last 20 years
when the oil sector are included. In mainland economy is emission intensity was almost halved in the same
period. CO2 emissions from new passenger cars have fallen by over 25 percent in recent years. Norway
The highest proportion of electric cars and hybrid cars in the world. In the years ahead must nevertheless national

36

Climate policy is intensifying. Labour's goal with the national climate policy is a
long-term restructuring of Norway to a low carbon society.
Labor wants the petroleum sector continued to be imposed harsh economic measures
through both tax and quotas. The national climate policy can and must be designed so that it also
is good business policy. The instruments should help to further develop and adapt Norwegian industry
climate-friendly direction. Technological development are crucial here.
It takes time to develop and realize new, climate-friendly solutions. The main driver for
technology in business is to praise greenhouse gases. Labour will also continue
the national focus on climate technology, through, among others, Enova and the fund for climate change, renewable
energy and energy conversion.
Norway is among the countries in the world with the highest proportion of clean renewable energy. It also allows our
energy-intensive industries are among those in the world with the least climate impact. It will contribute negatively about
Norwegian energy-intensive industries moving to countries with higher proportion of fossil energy.
Labour's aim is that the growth in passenger transport in metropolitan areas to be included
public transport, cycling and walking. It requires an integrated land use and transport planning and
that public transport and bicycle measures given increased priority in and around the main towns. At the same time more
freight over sea and rail. Jernbanens role in the transport system must be strengthened, especially around the main
towns. Labor will continue to pursue a policy that contributes to the phased into new and environmentally friendly
vehicle technology and fuel.
Labour will:
• Be a catalyst in efforts for a comprehensive and binding international climate treaty in 2015.
• Strengthen our international obligations further if this can contribute to agreement on an ambitious
climate agreement in which the major emitting countries undertake specific commitments.
• Strive to discontinue subsidies of fossil fuels and for a larger proportion of global emissions are
subject to an award and will be included in a carbon market.
• Working for comprehensive and robust mechanisms for financing climate measures in poor countries
through joint international regulations and common channels, such as the Green Climate Fund.
• Work to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries, as well
international shipping and aviation be included in a future global climate regime.
• Develop Climate and Forest Initiative and to consider increasing the Norwegian efforts on the positive
development continues.
• Strengthen international efforts against SLCFs.
• Invest in the development of renewable energy in developing countries.
• Invest in technology development in carbon capture and storage of CO2 and maintain that all new
gas power concessions should be based on the capture and storage of CO2.
• Strengthen climate research and step up efforts for the industry to develop and adopt new
climate-friendly technology.
• Aim the growth in passenger transport in urban areas should be taken by public transit,
bike and walk. It requires an integrated land use and transport planning and public transit
and cycling measures given increased priority in and around the main towns.
• Continue to use changes in car taxes to reduce emissions from the transport sector.
• Continue to focus on Transnova.
• Strengthen efforts avalanche warning control and quality assurance and emphasize that state and municipal
planning processes increasingly takes into account the possible effects of climate change.

Environment, outdoor recreation and nature conservation
Labor wants Norway to be a leader in environmental policy. We are known for our beautiful nature and
Our good environment, and we must take care of. Outdoors has an intrinsic value for the individual, providing good public health.
We must therefore ensure that as many as possible can enjoy our nature, whether hiking in the mountains, at sea, or
in greenery in cities. To solve environmental problems we need comprehensive international cooperation and
national and local environmental efforts. Both businesses, organizations and individual needs to take responsibility.
37

We will manage natural in a way that provides both current and future generations the opportunity to
nature experiences. Conserving biodiversity is not just a national concern but an area
where Norway has clear international obligations.
Labor will have viable predator originated in Norway, and will have a targeted predator management so
the level of conflict is reduced. The dual goals are the basis for our predator policy, we should
pursuing a policy that enables both viable predator strains and farming. Predator Settlement from 2011
to be followed up.
The national parks are an important part of our natural and cultural heritage, and it is important that the extension of selenium
national parks strengthened. It should be made for greater added value in relation to national parks,
for example through tourism. For Labor are important local involvement and ownership
protection matters. We will actively take care of endangered species and preserve biodiversity, habitats and landscapes.
We will place greater emphasis on flexible instruments, active management and voluntary forest protection rather than habitat protection.
Once this plan is completed, any new large protected areas as a rule base
in local initiatives.
It is important to ensure sufficient environmental expertise in Norwegian municipalities for municipalities to be able to take
their responsibilities in the environmental field, and that conservation and environmental commitments can maximize local custom
solutions.
The classic nature conservation is about preserving natural areas for future generations, prevent
environmental degradation and environmental and secure access to outdoor spaces for all. Access to space
for outdoors and low threshold of physical activity is an important issue in the country, whether in the mountains or by
sea.
We have presented new open air that strengthens public rights. Coordination Reform focuses on
Public Health in the new legislation. All municipalities must now create a people health. Labor believes
that outdoor organizations can play an important role in municipal preventive health care.
Labour will:
• Ensure universal access to mountains, fjords and sea and continue the acquisition scheme for beachfront property.
• Facilitate everyone to get pleasure of nature.
• Stopping the loss of biodiversity.
• Intensify efforts to combat alien species.
• Follow up predator settlement and continue the dual goals of policy on predators.
• Strengthen local management and value creation programs in protected areas.
• Investigate the harmful effects of the use of lead outside wetlands and shooting ranges, and on the
basis to decide an opening for the use of lead shot outside wetlands and shooting ranges.

Sustainable agriculture
The overall objectives for agricultural policy is food security, agriculture across the country, increased
wealth creation and sustainable agriculture.
Agricultural mission is to produce safe and varied food of good quality. Population growth and
climate change makes this an important task both nationally and internationally. Labour Party will, within
the given trade policy framework, facilitating increased production of agricultural products as it is
Nature provided the basis for and the market demands, so that self-sufficiency rate can be maintained at about
around the current level. Population increases, and SSB estimates that by 2030 will be 20% more people
in Norway. Demand from a growing population will give rise to increased production of agricultural commodities.
The agricultural sector is responsible for safeguarding the balance between production and demand.
Agricultural production must occur in an environmentally sustainable manner.
Agricultural policy must have such a device that can be produced food across the country, and including
must fjord and mountain consumption and the arctic agriculture get greater attention. Besides utilizing
natural resources for food production gives district agricultural employment and settlement, as well as the basis
38

for other business activities. This will also increasingly ensure that ownership of agricultural and
natural resources held in local hands.
Industry's overall profitability must be improved in the coming years. Farmers are independent
trader responsible for their own income. Through agricultural policy must framework
designed so that professional athletes in agriculture ensured income and social conditions in line with
other groups. Labour Party will therefore continue to develop income and welfare policies in agriculture with
Based on the agricultural policy which is led since 2005. Access to capital in agriculture must
strengthened in order to make necessary investments in farm buildings and assets in the years ahead.
It is crucial that market schemes for agriculture continued, and that the latter's role as
market regulator ensured. Strong import protection for agricultural products must be made to retain.
In the event of a new WTO agreement, we will use all the instruments agreement provides to ensure Norwegian
agricultural production and the Norwegian food industry. By such an agreement must be granted compensation for
loss of income.
To get young people to invest in agriculture, they must have opportunities to develop broad skills and
welfare programs must be strengthened, as well as economic instruments. There is a need to consider whether
current legislation and practices are adapted to the current situation in the industry and society. This applies to Land Bill,
Concession, ruined and issues surrounding the lease land. The adjustments must facilitate that
interested young people / people can fit in the industry.
Forestry and the whole forest industry compete internationally. Forests are our "green gold", and
environmentally friendly energy source for the future. Forests cover about 40% of our country and constitutes an important part of
our landscape. Development of policies and measures aimed at forestry must have overriding objective
to increase value creation in forestry and promote further development of a more robust wood-based industries.
Meanwhile, we will maintain the forest's vital importance as a recreational area for the population and its role
in terms of biodiversity and climate.
Forestry is a future industry. It is an important raw material source for bioenergy and could play an important role
in the transition to low-emission society. Wood fibers can replace a number of oil-based products and has a
broad application possibility.
We must at all levels to ensure a coherent and active forest management that underpins the forest is an integral
renewable resource to be exploited through active use and increased harvesting.
Labor believes the forestry industry must be a national strategic priority for development
overall value and food chains in Norway. All available means must be used to contribute to a
strong and competitive forestry and wood processing industry.
The State must contribute to the development of a strategic ownership in a forward-looking Norwegian forest industry, by
that the mandate for Investinor extended so that it can be invested in profitable and progressive forestry and
pulp and paper industry. Investinor ensure sufficient investment capital and funds earmarked for one
own framework for investment in the forest industry. The investments must be in line with normal requirements
returns and within the rules on state aid.
Agriculture in Norway has very different conditions related to our geography and our climate, this must
taken into consideration.
Labour will develop husbandry policy based on a threefold objective of ecologically, economically
and cultural sustainability, where economic sustainability is particularly important. We will work for stronger
focus on the industry as manufacturers of exclusive gastronomic and cultural experiences. Rein Meat is an Arctic
delicacy which has a market potential that should be exploited to a greater extent than today.
Reindeer husbandry must be ensured the necessary space and the number of reindeer must be adapted to grazing.

39

Reindeer Herding Act must be evaluated in particular with a view to a greater extent to protect the small players in the processes
where the total number of reindeer going down. The industrial policy aspects in the reindeer policy instruments must
reinforced.
Agricultural policy must contribute to finding a balance between use and conservation of natural resources. This
applies predator management, earmarking of land and the practice of intervention free zones in forestry.
Labor will have viable grazing industries and predators originated in Norway and exercise an active and
targeted predator management in line with the agreed population goals, so that the level of conflict in agriculture are
decreased, partly because local knowledge is emphasized in management. Labour believes that
uncultivated resource must be exploited for grazing and that this is taken into account in predator management. We will have good
compensation schemes.
With the country's limited land for food production, where cultivated and cultivable area amounts to 3% of the country
total area, it is necessary in a strong soil conservation.
Labor advocates a controlled liquidation of the fur industry. Reorganization of the establishment of new
agricultural activities on-farm agricultural resources are provided by the liquidation period.
The food industry is very important for Norway, with about 42 000 employees around the
country. Norwegian agriculture and the food industry are interdependent. We will have a
active agriculture across the country that deliver quality ingredients for the food industry. It is
important to strengthen and further develop the Norwegian food industry also in the future.
Labour will:
• Maintaining a diverse agriculture throughout the country, based on local resources, with agriculture,
forestry, grazing, cultural and reindeer.
• Maintain self-sufficiency rate of about current levels, through continuing the Norwegian
model with strong import protection.
• Maintain cooperative based market regulator and purchasers of Norwegian raw materials from the country.
• Maintain the current geographical production distribution.
• Provide a regulatory framework which assures a farming throughout the country with a diverse user structure.
• Ensure athletes in agricultural revenue trends and social conditions in line with other groups.
• Strengthen access to capital and instruments through Innovation Norway.
• Enhance focus on recruitment, equality and expertise, innovation and research in all parts of
value chain.
• Develop value creation programs for food, wood, reindeer husbandry and bioenergy.
• Encourage greater use of wood in new buildings.
• Ensure that all available means be used to contribute to a strong and competitive
forestry and wood processing industry.
• Require the handling of animals happens with care and respect for its natural characteristics.
Animals have an intrinsic value and the FSA must be strengthened in order to prioritize supervision of animal welfare.
• Ensure that animals have acceptable conditions of transport to the slaughterhouse.
• Develop and strengthen the Norwegian food industry, and to facilitate continued access to
ingredients from Norwegian agriculture.
• Conduct a review of the rules for joint operations.
• Grants for trenching should be an element in future rural agreements.
• Conducting an active and targeted predator management, so that the level of conflict in agriculture is reduced.

Coast Driven
Our lengthy coast gives us a unique proximity to the ocean and its resources, and it has dominated
people and business in this country since time immemorial. Nevertheless, the situation differs in the
various parts of the country. The small coastal municipalities in our northernmost county has lost about half
of the population since the late 60s, while many coastal municipalities in western Norway have had supernatural
growth as the oil and gas sector is developed. Labor will continue to pursue the
natural advantages as the long coastline gives us.
40

Norges havareal is seven times as large as the mainland area. Being a maritime nation provides both opportunities
and responsibility. The opportunities are to exploit the rich resources of the sea gives us. The responsibility is to manage
oceans in a sustainable way so that our descendants will benefit from the values ​​sea
gives us. Sea is vulnerable to climate change. We still do not know enough about how increased ocean temperatures will
affect sea life. Knowledge about climate change is important for managing marine resources ours, and
in order to facilitate any changes in economic activity along the coast.
Labor will make Norway the world's leading seafood nation. That means we need to be in
forefront of knowledge in terms of both the marine environment, sustainable resource management, aquaculture, capture,
production, product development and marketing. Fishing resources, other wild living marine resources and
the corresponding genetic material is community property.
To fulfill the goal of being the world's leading seafood nation must research, technological development and
innovation even more strongly implemented in the seafood sector. It is an advantage for Norway that we have
strong marine and maritime clusters. Labor will facilitate our marine and maritime
clusters and research centers can exchange experiences and knowledge so that these industries greater
degree can draw on common experiences for future growth and development. Labor will have a varied
fleet and fair distribution of fishery resources that contribute to employment and settlement along the coast.
Labor is concerned that the fleet is profitable enough to attract both labor and capital.
The value added of our shared fishery resources should as far as possible to get the fisheries dependent
coastal communities as a whole. Fisheries authorities should regularly assess the need to allocate new
fishing rights to ensure recruitment of young fishermen, or to protect special commercial or
political considerations.
Or to introduce measures providing for a single athlete a fixed-term share of the national
catch quota. National authorities must be able to allocate up to 10 percent of the national quota
for landing and processing in particularly vulnerable districts to ensure employment in manufacturing. The raw material
captured off the coast, will generally be processed at facilities on land. Fisheries resources must
investment strategy is the highest possible long-term resource extraction within sustainable limits, and with a view
on an as stable as possible from year to year.
Labor believes that the Norwegian seafood industry will be further developed through a strategic initiative that
build on our advantage in access to fresh raw materials of high quality. Labor wants to facilitate
that most fish can be processed in Norway. Processing industry must be guaranteed stable supply of raw material
all year.
To ensure recruitment of young people who are educated in relevant subjects and make etterog continuing education for those already working in the industry, will be important for the industry
development opportunities in the future. Labour will therefore have an educational boost for the seafood industry.
Norway has a long coastline with cold water and plenty of space. This gives us good natural conditions for
Aquaculture. In the 40 years the aquaculture industry has existed in Norway has developed into a major industry
that produce healthy and good seafood and creates important jobs and value for Norway.
Labor looks at increasing aquaculture production as an important contribution to the future seafood industry, and
wants to facilitate further growth in the industry within an environmentally sustainable framework. Simultaneously
we are concerned that the challenges that the industry today, mainly lice and escapes, must be resolved.
Labor will also facilitate increased processing.
Labour will:
• Ensure sustainable management of fisheries resources, strengthening resource control significantly and combat
illegal fishing.
• Preserving Participation Act and the Raw.
• Encourage greater supply of fresh fish quota bonus and fresh fish strategy.
• Facilitate a diverse, profitable fleet which helps to secure employment along the coast.
• Ensure that the vessel has been authorized to fish against the obligation to deliver in certain regions, comply
terms.
41

• Stand firm in that it is not allowed to install plants in vessels that do not already have such a facility
and make regulations for production aboard most similar regulations for production on land.
• Develop good interaction forums between maritime and marine industries and intensify efforts
on research, technology and innovation in the fisheries and aquaculture sector.
• Promote growth of aquaculture within environmentally sustainable limits.
• Contribute to the communities get back to set their spaces available for aquaculture
since a part of the consideration of new licenses shall accrue to the municipalities.
• Give the seafood industry an educational boost.
• Facilitate industrial development including by ensuring predictable access to raw materials
throughout the year for processing companies and industries.

ICT - availability, knowledge and value creation
Internet and use of ICT means that we are in the midst of a technological and social change which is the largest
since industrialization. ICT constitutes an increasing part of our daily lives. Labor will ensure that
everyone in the community has the necessary digital literacy so that there arise new social divisions between the
who have and those who do not have such expertise.
Digital solutions are developed quickly, they are often cheaper than traditional solutions, and in areas such as
health, education, media and the public sector, new solutions now established. Labor will exploit
its possibilities to create better service, value creation and more knowledge of the population.
Access to good and stable internet solutions are an important part of our infrastructure. It is important for
the individual's participation in society and the business sector. Today, over 96% of the population
Norway access to the Internet at home, and compared to other countries, there are many who participate in it
digital community. It is important as ICT is no longer just a support function, but one
core function. For businesses, this is a competitive advantage that Labor must contribute to
develop further. Both for individuals, businesses and public sector is access to the Internet has become a
necessity in line with other infrastructure.
Security and resilience of the network is important for the population's security and confidence to use network services. Online
must be openly accessible to all and the individual must be able to decide what content is
received. Labor will facilitate that Norway should have a broadband offering world class.
Labor will invest in new industries. ICT and Internet contributes to economic growth in many areas. The
gives the opportunity that each company can operate more efficiently and provide access to a global market. ICT
Norwegian businesses a competitive edge when they venture into foreign markets. Knowledge, ideas and
services disseminated faster and more. While the ICT sector contributes to development in many industries,
it creates also products on their own. Companies exploring new possibilities and creates products
responding to customers' expectations, the companies of tomorrow. Norwegian businesses deliver world-class products
based on ICT solutions.
ICT markets are continuously evolving. Labor will ensure that the public is
facilitator for the industry, while the government should be careful not to intervene in markets
in a way that may hamper innovation. Development of APP's has become a new industry, and many products
developed based on public records made available as data sets. Norway is a small market,
and it is therefore important that we rely on international standards to provide Norwegian actors access
export markets.
It saved huge amounts of data in the world today, and these require storage. Labor will
focus on green data centers that use less energy and resources than other data centers because one
achieve synergies related to power supply, broadband access, cooling and more efficient utilization of
excess heat from the machines. Norwegian climate combined with an ample supply of electricity and
well-developed privacy laws means that Norway is well suited for such activities established here.
Labor will strengthen Norway's competitiveness through education, skills and research
ICT. Therefore, we must have sufficient expertise in high education. It is important that
42

the research conducted, both at fundamental level and a higher level of relevance for
sector.
Labour will:
• The network neutrality principle is retained.
• Making sure we have an open and non-discriminatory internet.
• Using public means of ensuring access where market-based solutions are not required.
• The residents will be offered secure and robust fixed and mobile broadband networks of good quality.
• The data collected by the public, must be made available so that it can develop new
products based on such raw data.
• That Norway must be active participants in the international standardization process and actively support
open standards.
• That Norway shall be one of the leading markets for ICT-based services.
• Contribute to the ICT sector can still be an important growth industry in Norway.
• Using Norway's competitive advantage actively to implement green data centers.
• The population should have digital skills and use digital services in a safe and secure manner.
• Focus on privacy and high security so that people have confidence and use of digital
services.
• Ensure that adults who are unemployed should get strengthened its basic digital
expertise.
• Have ICT researchers of high international level.
• Strengthen cooperation and dialogue between educational institutions and industry.

5) Welfare Society

I have volunteered ever since I retired and held elected both in municipal and
organizations for almost 20 years. For older people, there are three things that are essential. One is the care and
care, secondly, proper nutrition, and the third is socializing. Municipalities must spend more
money in a proper and dignified care. I see how important volunteering is for many seniors, both for a
better care and for an active life. It is also important to have good cultural offerings, which can give the older one
richer everyday.
Torleif, 82 years, Oslo. Pensioner.

45

We must be good at sharing and to ensure participation
Communities provide security and strength. Small differences gives cohesion and trust. It makes Norway better. Every
individual has the responsibility to shape their own lives but the community forms we a society that
makes this possible. This mutual commitment form the basis for common welfare, and for everyone,
regardless of background, should have equal opportunities to develop themselves and live a good life.
Community based on the obligations and rights for all. Work is the basis of welfare
- And is part of welfare. Work is a good - and it creates benefits. A society with equal opportunities
is a society where more people can succeed. That more success is better for everyone. Social security and economic growth is
preconditions for continued progress for our country. Confident people creates more because they dare more.
By preventing more it becomes less to repair. It will give many individuals a better life.
It will make our society stronger. Labour will develop good, modern and efficient
welfare services to become even better. The Norwegian welfare state should not be minimum welfare, but
confidence is there the day you get sick, need help or fall off.

Arbeidslinja
Our goal is that everyone should be able to stand on its own. Each individual should have the opportunity to know the joy of
Being independent, evolve and be part of a community in the community or in the workplace.
Labor believes in people's power and willingness to take responsibility. Our premise is that all human beings are
different, but all have something to contribute to society is valuable and useful. Therefore all contribute.
Three principles should be a common thread in our policy to ensure increased participation:
We will make demands. Everyone can contribute. Everyone has abilities, skills and capabilities that are valuable. But not all
has been made use of them, because they have not been challenged or met with recognition or expectations.
We will require the participation and increase the use of such duty by public assistance.
We want to set up. Some may need rehabilitation, qualification and facilitation. This must be tailored.
Employers may need guidance on how they can arrange for workers who need it,
for example for disabled people and others with disabilities. We want to have a service set NAV, which should
support and guidance when needed. Those who can not work, should be confident that they are getting the
support they need and secured access to venues which provide community.
We will unite all positive forces. Voluntary workers play a particularly important role as a complement to the
public welfare and services. Organizations, nonprofit organizations and social entrepreneurs
reaches out to audiences that traditionally do not seek NAV or public assistance, or who may experience
threshold as too high. We will facilitate all good forces contribution.
Our welfare system should provide security and prevent abuse. It requires collaboration between different
agencies and that it has a regulatory and ICT systems that facilitates secure information exchange,
within the framework of basic privacy.
We want welfare that provide welfare. People who build up social security rights
Norway, you have the right to take these with them if they leave for other countries. Today's migration flows makes it
necessary to examine whether the regulations are in line with the new reality. In further development of
welfare society we put more emphasis on services than cash transfers. We want to attach obligations to
benefits.
Social security is an important prerequisite for everyone's participation. When needed good public welfare services.
Work for all is the most important means of combating poverty. A weak economy also weakens the ability to
participate in public arenas that cost money, such as cultural and sports activities. It can go very
beyond children. Labor will prioritize an economic policy that ensures small differences and measures
counteract social skew, especially among children and adolescents.

46

Labour will:
• The graded benefits and the opportunity to be part of work due to illness or disability shall be a
active instrument health and participation.
• The requirements on active job seeking, qualification or rehabilitation should be actively used by social assistance,
so that as soon as possible to be able to stand on its own.
• That treatment for physical or mental health problems should be combined with participation in work or
vocational training, unless it is justifiable.
• That people with addictions should be followed up closely in the form of a combination of help
master drug problems and job training. The follow-up should be offered in the form of an individual program
modeled after the qualification program.
• Provide young people under 25 who are unemployed, targeted measures to bring them back to work or
education or offering them a tailored activity plan with work-related measures.
• Ensure more related to the work through time-limited and long-term wage subsidies.
• Develop several trainee programs, new utprøvningsjobber and training positions, emphasizing
groups who are currently outside the labor market, especially people with mental disorders and persons
with disabilities.
• Strengthen diversity among those working in the public sector, including in terms
minority and disability. Public enterprises should be in front of
retain talented seniors to work.
• Involve civil society in efforts to get more people into the labor market. Initiative by great actors
could reach out to audiences that traditionally do not seek NAV or public services.

residential areas.
• Strengthen counseling about debt and finances by NAV office and ensure that this is part
of follow-up in the individual plan.
• The establishment of mechanisms to ensure that children in families living on social benefits going to get
opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities.

Children and family
The family is the closest community to community. Labor will have a policy that
ensure that you can combine a good family life with working life. The families will be a good frame
for children to grow up in. Families who for different reasons experience difficulties, will get the help they
need.
It should be easy to combine children and career. Fathers and mothers are equal caregivers
for their children. Labor has been a driving force to introduce and extend the time they can receive

47

parental and paternity quota. This has had an impact on both parents' ability to care
for their children. Labor will make it easier for students to become parents.
Most people want to have children, but many people find it difficult to get the children they so gladly wish
itself. Labor believes it is a great good for society and the individual that is born children, and
want to put the best possible conditions for this. Therefore, we will expand the number of experiments with artificial insemination
in the public health system and better support those who want to adopt.
New advances in technology and medical science gives us increasing opportunities to realize desired
to have children. Labor recognizes that this also raises a number of difficult ethical questions.
Labor did not want a commercialization of this field, and we will say no to a development where
Parents can select properties to their children.
Family concept is not static, and children growing up in different family constellations. Stepchildren adoptions in
gays families to be implemented faster and easier.
Labor will not open for surrogacy in Norwegian law. Meanwhile, there are more children born abroad
Lack of rights when they come to Norway. In such cases, the Labor putting children
best first.
Labour will:
• Introduce 12-month study support for students with children and dependents increased scholarships for those with
lowest incomes.

• See whether it should be limited how often child custody cases can be traced to the court and whether
right to free legal aid work as intended to curb the number of conflict cases.

Child welfare
CPS in Norway shall ensure the right help at the right time. Where there is a need for assistance must come CPS
in as early as possible. The CPS must have close contact with health clinics, kindergartens, schools and
other agencies who work with children, to capture challenges early, and give children in need
for it, the best possible follow-up. It is best for the child who will control efforts. Measures to be implemented
in, in the home or outside, must be professionally justified, and child care services should regularly assess whether
the measures are implemented, work appropriately. To ensure good help, a child must vote
heard before decisions are made. Labor will have a knowledge-based child care. The CPS must have
expertise to help children in multicultural families.
Labor did not want a market-driven welfare. We will not contest postpone public
institutions in child protection. We will give priority to non-profit organizations rather than by commercial public
purchase of child welfare services. At such purchases must be prioritized quality as the main criterion.
Nonprofit organizations providing welfare services to the public, will have long-term framework for
cooperation.
48

Labour will:
• The child must take precedence for the biological principle.
• Introduce an overriding provision in the Child Welfare Act that strengthen children's participation in all matters
that concern them.
• Reviewing the requirements of confidentiality to ensure that these do not prevent information
the child's best, being conveyed to the right care.
• Raising the multicultural expertise in child welfare, so neglect in families with
immigrant background can easily be identified.
• encourage more foster care offers, among families with a multicultural background.
• The institution only in exceptional cases should be a durable solution for the child. In cases they still need to be taken
in use, the institutions should be differentiated. Institutions need to be adapted to the individual
needs.
• Ensure that children and adolescents who are child welfare responsibilities, has the same right and obligation to education
other children. If they do not follow regular school instruction, there must be a decision and it
be given adapted teaching.

• Ensure that the notification requirement for schools, kindergartens and health professionals have for suspected serious
neglect or child abuse, are observed.

A safe and free youth
In adolescence makes you a variety of choices that are important for how one's own future should be. Therefore,
Labor believes that a good youth policy must ensure that young people feel safe enough to
make good choices. Safe enough to dare to make untraditional choices. Safe enough to resist pressure from others.
Safe enough to be free. Being free is being able to choose the one that suits just you, regardless of
where you live, what economic or cultural background you have, and regardless of what gender, what
religion and sexual orientation you have.
To ensure freedom and security must youth primarily ensured participation in matters concerning
themselves. Labor also believes that youth must have good opportunities for influence and participation
in school life and in the community. To get started with growing existence we must avoid
that young starts his working career with unemployment. Youth guarantee must therefore be developed. Today
youth major challenges to get into the housing market. A proactive housing policy must be
especially targeting the young can get housing.
Adolescence is also a vulnerable time. Easy access to a health service that is accommodating and can
guide and assist in a good way in questions of identity and sexuality, and with good qualifications
on mental health is needed. Efforts to prevent adolescents from being exposed to bullying and violence must be
even better to ensure safety during adolescence. Teachers and health care workers should receive increased
competence of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender (LGBT) and the challenges LGBT youth
in general, and particularly in immigrant communities, meetings. Counties must enter into agreements with municipalities
ensuring that the vocational schools has a good and accessible school health.
To prevent mental disorders related to body, it is important to work for young people in a vulnerable phase
not exposed to unrealistic body ideals. Labour will therefore consider more stringent regulation
and guidelines for marketing products aimed specifically at young people and which manufactures and
promotes unhealthy body ideals.
Labour will:
• Have a boost for the country's health centers for youth so that there is an equal and real deals
entire country.
• Provide all students from Year 8 to VG3 better access to health visitors and plans to recruit more men
to the profession.

Encourage municipalities to have 'home for a 50-patch "scheme.
Encourage counties to have children and youth fares on public transport up to 18 years.
That all trainees must be covered by student and student.

Consumer
Consumers should be ensured the opportunity to make informed choices. Through the use of technologies more
more information is made available, and digital tools provide new possibilities to sort the information.
Consumers should be protected against harmful chemicals and pollutants. Private housing is the biggest
investment consumers make. Labor believes Norwegian homebuyers must be better protected against errors and
deficiencies in the dwelling.
Labour will:
• The publicly available price and product information also made available electronically.
• Implement an action plan for a toxic consumer everyday.
• Strengthen consumer demands for information by purchases, and ensure buy better against defects
at the residence.
• Stricter requirements for the marketing of consumer loans.

Accessibility and participation
Increased physical and practical accessibility is not only important for people with permanently reduced
disability: Many experience reduced mobility / mobility or sensory loss in the parts of life. In order to
get everyone we need to dismantle the barriers to participation. Often barriers that make participation difficult,
created by people. Products, buildings and outdoor areas should as far as possible be designed so that they can
used by anyone, without special adaptations or aids. Universal design is incorporated in all
relevant legislation.
Opportunities for active participation is also about access to goods, services and information. Public
information must be available to everyone. That means for example, that information must be available on
audio file, as well as be in electronic form.
Labour will:
• Removing barriers and ensure universal design and accessibility so that everyone can participate in
community.
• Contribute to the raising of expertise in universal design among those responsible for public planning,
development and procurement.
• The new stops being built and transport equipment acquired, are universally available.
• Ensure that digital solutions formulated universally.

• The school building should be prioritized in the work on universal design.

Pension and social security
National Insurance is community safety for the individual income in old age, invalidity or when
supporter lapses. Pension settlement for retirement and for new disability benefits ensuring a predictable
and stable pension system for the future. The main objectives are to ensure the individual financial security and
make it possible to combine work and pensions, or labor and social security.
Dividing and differences in occupational pension schemes impede restructuring and fluency in the workplace. We
has in recent years seen a development in the private sector where good performance schemes has been replaced by
deposit schemes. These are both cheaper and more predictable for business, but provide consistently
poorer benefits for employees. To ensure all employees in the private sector earning retirement
additional benefits from social security, were the Act on mandatory occupational pensions (OTP) introduced in 2006,
still not secured an acceptable level of pension for all workers. To create a basis for a
wide, collective pension system also in the private sector, and that is adapted to the new state, yesterday
Labor in order to prepare a legal framework that could enable such contractual arrangements. Such
arrangements would also make it easier to change employers in the private sector without losing pension.
Labour will:
• Ensure good public benefits for people who can not participate in the labor market.
• Implement pension reform and introduction of new disability benefits from 2015.
• Ensuring continued good pension and that it can be combined with being employed.
• Ensuring the framework conditions for early retirement in the private sector.
• Consider age limits in the context of social development and adapt them to
pension reform efforts.
• encourage that more seniors are working after the age of 70.

Actively seniorliv
Seniors make up a large and growing part of the population. Most are active and have ample opportunities
for development and quality of life. More seniors should be involved in organizations and voluntary societies.
Socializing and joint activities may also postpone development of aging diseases. That is why
important prevention to ensure good meeting places for seniors, through senior centers and activity centers.
Labour will:
• Encourage link between NGOs, cultural and senior measures and contact
local community, so that we can facilitate an active and participatory old age.
• Pulling into NGOs, library and senior citizen centers at work to give seniors the opportunity to
teach the use of ICT.
• Making active use of councils for the elderly.
• Develop deals with senior training as positive meeting places with professional content
Seniors in different parts of the country.
• The new pensioners are being offered an overview of volunteers in the municipality and are encouraged to participate
active in the community.

Care, safety and freedom
Recruiting a sufficient number of qualified employees in nursing and care is one of the
biggest challenges to ensure good welfare services in the years to come.
Those who are nursing and care needy are entitled to a provision based on sound knowledge and expertise
among employees and the opportunity to live an eventful life even if they need help in everyday life. Then it is
important to continue strengthening municipal finances and the care services are tailored to individual needs.

Care Plan 2020
Labor believes that the future health and care services must be characterized by sufficient staff,
expertise and innovation and development. We must rethink and provident around subjects and methods,
organization, technology and cooperation with volunteers and relatives.
Older is the largest user of health services in the municipalities. The number of elderly
begins to increase from 2020. We have used the period from 2005 to rehabilitate and build of beds
care spaces, to strengthen expertise among staff and to increase the number of employees in the sector. In time
2020 we must continue and intensify these efforts. We must also use this period to
To prepare the modified demographics and develop new and innovative health care services for
seniors as well as for others who need good services in the municipalities.
Anyone who needs a place in an institution or a home with live-in care, should have it. Municipalities
must have sufficient institutional to those who need it, and so that residents with long-term space
institution gets a single room if they wish.
Labor will replace care plan in 2015 with a new and reinforced Care Plan in 2020.

Labor will in the period 2015 to 2020:
• enable municipalities to increase by an additional 10 000 new full-time positions in health and
care sector up to 2020, while there are plans for a further growth of
2020.
• Aim to increase the proportion of employees with formal qualifications in the health care sector
so ¾ possess such expertise.
• Increase the number of health care workers, nurses, occupational therapists and physiotherapists in the sector.
• The municipalities should create development plans that show the need for rehabilitation and construction
of of beds residential care places. The State shall pursue a government subsidy to
support such a development.

Quality and content
Very many of those who today live in a nursing home, suffering from dementia. Seats being built and polished
up, must therefore be tailored to the needs of dementia patients and nursing homes must ensure that residents are experiencing
security and care. Those who suffer from dementia, to experience meaning and content of everyday life even though
they are sick. Livsglede Certification is a means to lift the quality in nursing homes and in residential areas and of beds
care. Such concept should be further developed and disseminated. Culture is an important contribution to provide good experiences for
residents.
Dagaktivitetstilbudene must be further developed. Living at home with dementia should be guaranteed
dagaktivitetstilbud, and the goal is that all municipalities must such an offer. Labor will continue
to subsidize the creation of spaces, and aims to legislate the obligation to provide dagaktivitetstilbud
when the offer is built further out. Both the staff and the relatives must have more expertise about
dementia disorders. Through relatives schools should dependents receive support, guidance and knowledge.
Innovation in care
Future competence need to address the skills needs a new and future-oriented health
care services want.
Everyone should be able to live in security and freedom in his own home, including those who need help to survive
in everyday life. Several public tasks will in the future be solved differently and smarter than
before. Innovation in the care and use of welfare technology will be able to help more people get help, but
also that the support gets better. When used properly, this can give more closeness between people, more security
in everyday life and opportunities for a more social and active life. Then the individual will also be able to stay at home
52

anymore. For employees in the health care sector can new technologies lead to time savings and that the work
become less physically stressful.
We will have a care service that ensures seniors a dignified life, respect, choice and privacy.
By focusing on prevention will more delay or avoid getting serious illnesses, and those who need
help will get better follow-up. Home care needs to be developed, and people receiving health care and
practical assistance in the home, must expect coordination, firm agreements and the fewest possible people to
relate to.
New technology can help develop safety housing thus making it possible for more people to stay at home
anymore. Combined with multilingual staff service and common room for socializing, it can help
a good and safe old age for many.
Coordination Reform implies that people should not have to be hospitalized when they are not
need it. It is good for the individual, and it is good for society. Municipalities have visibly
prevention responsibilities and can through good preventive measures prevent hospitalization. Future
Elderly must build on the ideas and principles of interaction reform.
The needs of the end of life must be safeguarded. It should be easier for those who wish to die at home.
In the end of life, it is essential that their family should receive sufficient information to be able to take appropriate
decisions. This must also be seen in the context of the right to parental leave when their caring responsibilities
for close relatives.

A mobilization for public health and prevention
Good physical and mental health is essential for the individual's quality of life and for society's ability
to create and share. Public health has been central to the Labour Party throughout our history.
The labor movement has been in the forefront for better work, higher housing standards and justifiable
sanitation. Increased life expectancy, less inequalities in health and a better life for the individual in the last century
came largely as a result of improved public health. For Labor is solid public health
the foundation of health policy. We must now again have a broad mobilization for public health.
Everyone has responsibility for their own health. But the community also has responsibility for everyone's health. Norway is a country
with small economic differences. Still, we find the clearest social inequalities in health. Good
distribution policy is good public health policy.
We are facing an increase in non-communicable lifestyle diseases such as World Health Organization
call an epidemic; heart disease, diabetes, cancer, respiratory diseases and mental disorders. 80 percent of
all deaths in Norway is due to reach these non-communicable diseases, and there are clear social disparities.
We have the knowledge and means to meet these new public health challenges. It is well documented
prevention, and particularly community-oriented initiatives, is what gives the most health for money
and the greatest welfare gains. If we are to prevent and repel this epidemic of
lifestyle diseases, needed a mobilization for public health. It is about the prevention of physical
and psychological distress, the human ability to live full lives, and to deploy available
human and financial resources.
Physical activity is a source of health and quality of life, and is necessary for normal growth and development of
children and youth. Physical activity as a health promoting factor is a "fresh" that must be maintained
through daily movement and active use of the body. We humans can exercise throughout life.
We also know that too little physical activity is a risk factor for developing a number of health problems and
diseases such as overweight and obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, several
cancers and musculoskeletal diseases.
As a consequence of increased life expectancy and new lifestyle challenges, we know that many more people
going to live with the disease. To ensure security and freedom of the individual, says Labor
that this makes it even more important to prioritize basic and long-term public health and
health prevention. This must also be adapted best for the individual may be able to take responsibility for
prevent ill health and give themselves good self-care.

54

Labour's health policy is grounded in a solid commitment to early intervention and the important
public health work done in all sectors of society. Everyone should have equal access to necessary
healthcare quality regardless of residence or personal finance.
Public health measures in many areas has secured the majority of the population good dental health and thus
relatively low costs on prevention and treatment. Good dental health is closely linked to
rest of public health and must therefore be taken to ensure good contact between dentists and the rest of
health.
Labor will ensure all the major expenses. Labor will introduce a egenbetalingsstak for
essential dental care and 75% coverage of excess spending.
Labor will continue to work for everyone to be assured of a good dental health. Good prevention
and access to dental services across the country is important. Regular dental checks are an effective
preventive measures. To lay a good foundation, it is important to encourage young people go to
dentist. Labor will thus expand the discount for youth to multiple cohorts. Labor
will introduce screening arrangements for dental expenses for people with low incomes and poor
dental health. We will consider whether benefit or fee group hit his needs best. Dental status and needs
Treatment should be defined on the basis of clearly defined criteria set by the authorities. Labor will
continue to improve the arrangements for reimbursement through national insurance to specific diagnoses.
Labor will increase fees it charges for groups with rare medical conditions, even after
age 20, for people with diabetes and people with cancer diagnoses / treatment of cancer affecting
dental status.
Labor will go towards reimbursement rate to fee tariff for people with dry mouth and will ensure that
these receive treatment earlier than today.
Domestic violence is a public health issue of great personal as well as societal
charge. Health services must be improved to prevent and detect violence and abuse.
The health service's expertise in monitoring of victims of domestic violence must be improved.
Labour will:
• Monitor and promote the public health focus in coordination reform and implementation of new law on
public health.
• Strengthen local efforts for improving public health, including by facilitating access to
public health advisors in municipalities and that preventive health care gets a natural place in
Municipality plans.
• Strengthen support scheme to healthy living centers and training and empowering centers,
• Facilitate a national commitment to cycling and other physical activity through to build trails,
footpaths, pedestrian and cycle paths, and through activity campaigns directed at different audiences.
• The chronically ill learn to cope and prevent further development of disease. Increase
dissemination of knowledge about common disorders using peer support, along with
user organizations.
• Encourage municipalities to enter into agreements with the ideal actors for preventive
nursing.
• Strengthen the school health so that the gearing for prevention, especially for better mental
health and against obesity.
• Ensuring better prevention and public health through a commitment to more public health nurses.
• Facilitate both daily physical activity and healthy food will help to ensure good learning environment in
the school.
• Provide an offer early ultrasound also in the public health service.
• Expanding midwives to prescribe contraceptives.
• Review improvements in care pay scheme for more predictability in the allocation and
apportioning benefits.

55

• Maintain liquor scheme and ensure the scheme's legitimacy by changing the law to allow
vinmonopolet can stay open on Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve, Easter Eve and Whit Sunday, and on
election day.
• That all transgender people and people who experience gender identity challenges, shall receive an equitable
offered treatment. Tran People should have the opportunity to change their legal gender without requirements
sterilization.
• Develop preventive work for good people dental health.

Recruitment to the healthcare sector
In coming years, the need for health services will increase, and there will be a great need for
labor to this sector. Expertise needs will also change. Recruitment to health
care sector must therefore be wider than today, and the public must have a strong focus on adding
facilitate and motivate more people to enter these professions.
Good working conditions, jobs based on whole style reductions and better gender balance could have a
recruiting effect. The same experience of the health care sector as a career path
with opportunities for development and new challenges.
More full-time jobs in the health care sector provides greater predictability and quality for users and
makes the workday more predictable for employees. The long term goal is that full-time positions shall
be the general rule in the health sector.
Labour will:
• Understanding of the work done to include women in traditionally male-dominated programs
and occupations, and implement changes as necessary to recruit wider.
• Provide gender points for girls who choose traditionally female-dominated programs in health and
care.
• Have more men in care professions, and establish a nationwide project to recruit more
men.
• Work systematically and knowledge based on renunciation of health and care programs.
• Provide training in the use of welfare technology in healthcare education. Lay
basis for innovation in welfare technology through educational pathways and in the workplace.
• Focus on continuing education and training provision for staff in the care sector.
• Along with the parties pursue a full-time culture in the care sector. The long term goal is that
the general rule in the health sector should be full-time positions.

The best treatment when you are sick
Labor wants the public to be responsible for funding and prioritizing health
care services. When we ensure equitable access to programs and services and the proper use of public
resources. We do not want privatization and commercialization of health services that build
down public services.
Labour's goal is that if you get sick in Norway, you should be confident that one of the world
best health service stands ready to help you. Norwegian health service will continue to be a public responsibility,
and private payments by healthcare should be low so no one is excluded because of the economy.
The organization of the services must be such that the quality is best.
Our goal is that the treatment will give the best results, and that it can be provided in a manner that takes into account
the patient's wishes and circumstances. Through changes that have occurred in recent years, we have
concentrated advanced treatments at fewer hospitals. This has resulted in increased survival for example
of heart attack, traffic injuries and cancer. This development must continue. Most less complicated
Treatments may however be given in smaller units. That means we have to work for as many as possible can help
at home or close to where they live whenever possible without compromising quality.

56

Norwegian health service is not good enough to involve patients. We believe that patients should get
better information and greater influence over their own treatment. Service level can be increased further
by increasing telephone accessibility, reduce waiting times and systematically ask patients own
feedback.
GP, the emergency room and the emergency medical services in Norway are mostly of high quality. This
chain of available competent medical care that does not require reference, is an important cornerstone in
health. Competence and availability contribute to a safe health care when we need
it. A well-functioning RGP scheme relieves the emergency room. Functional OOH relieves
emergency medicine. These services must be further developed and cooperation and information between them must
strengthened. A good municipal and good municipal solutions in care are essential
in the work of the Coordination Reform. Labour believes that there must be good political governance to
achieve the best results within health services and hospitals. Therefore Labor that the state owns
hospitals, and that this should be combined with regional and local involvement. The local affiliation
for the regional health authorities can further be improved including through strengthened dialogue between
health regions and local authorities. Labor will further develop the Norwegian hospital model
and retaining the regional level. We will ensure public ownership and a clear political direction,
prioritization. Within these limits will Labor consider adjustments to the current model.
When transitions and coordination in the Oslo area and at Oslo University Hospital is completed,
we will consider the organization of the South-East area, including the possibility of dividing up the region,
to strengthen regional ties hospital model.
The main thrust of health policy should be anchored in Parliament through the annual budget documents, the
national healthcare plan and white papers on current topics.
Waiting times for hospital treatment should be reduced both by increasing capacity, improving
organization, better interaction with municipalities and better prevention. Although we achieved most
through prevention, then it will be necessary to increase funding for hospitals in the years
ahead to make sure we can use technological advances for the benefit of patients and be
prepared for changed age structure of the population.
Technological developments and development of new drugs constantly give us new opportunities to
cure disease. At the same time it brings us up in difficult discussions about priorities and use of resources
the new and unsafe treatments. We want it to be professional assessments that
Because of the choice of methods and medicines, so that we can help as many as possible with the resources to
disposal.
Labour will:
• At hospitals, municipal health and general practitioners should cooperate organizational and professional so
residents receive the best and fastest possible treatment.
• Increase patient safety through openness and learning in both hospital and community health services.
• Ensure collaboration and information flow in all parts of the health of comprehensive and coordinated
patient care, also electronically.

• Promoting knowledge-based decisions on priorities and assessments of new drugs and
treatment.
• Encourage interaction and cooperation with non-profit and private sector to contribute to a good overall in
health. It is important with predictable agreements for nonprofit sectors.

Rehabilitation
One of the pillars of good health is habilitation and rehabilitation. Good habilitation and
rehabilitation services is for many a prerequisite for participation in society, and is an important part of
Cooperation Reform. We want a stronger prioritization of rehabilitation hospitals and municipalities.
The aim of these services is to provide assistance so that people will get the best coping skills,
independence and social inclusion. By making users the most self-reliant as early as
possible increases quality of life, and can in some cases prevent hospitalization / institution.
Rehabilitation takes place in the whole treatment chain, but rehabilitation home has recently
received increased attention. We will develop new arenas where municipalities and hospitals go
together to create good rehabilitation programs, in various areas of health and care services.
Good rehabilitation services requires management commitment and collaboration across professions.
In many municipalities are developing now new services and ways of working. This is a desirable development
Labor supports and will help to continue.
Those who coordinates the rehabilitation of the regional health authorities, should be given a stronger
role in the coordination and development of rehabilitation. Residential rehab hastened ring choice should be introduced in
specialist services. Labor will have a rehabilitation forum where the municipal sector,
hospital regions, rehabilitation institutions and patient organizations discusses development
discipline and develop a national hub for rehabilitation.

Right help at the right time - Mental Health
Many people will through life experience being mentally ill. Openness about mental health and illness
is one of the most important contributions we as a society can provide those affected. Many mental disorders can
preventable, others can get early treatment rapid healing. The extent of mental disorders in
population makes it possible to say that this is a significant public health problem. Increased knowledge about mental
health in the elderly are important for the correct diagnosis and offer appropriate help.
The basis for good mental health is laid early. A society characterized by good fellowship and solutions
Inclusion of all stock limits for good life and can prevent future mental disorders. Early
effort and participation in working life, as well as work-related measures, could lead to shorter course of disease.
Prevention of mental problems happening on good common arenas and through good healthcare that
captures those falling outside. New ways of working are central, such as group approach, fast
help for those with minor mental disorders and more fixed psychologists in municipalities.
Through kindergarten shape, we have ensured that most children attend kindergarten. It has positive
effects for mental health. Kindergartens of high quality is the most important instrument community
to promote children's mental health. Labor will consider better regulation of the physical and
psychosocial environment in kindergartens.
To ensure continuity in the treatment of adolescents suggests that patients within the Labour Ministry of Children and
Ungdomspsykiatri (BUP) as far as possible get to keep their permanent deal in up to five years after age
18 years.
Labor will have more fixed psychologists in municipalities. Psychologists must work on prevention,
interdisciplinary, individual as well as group-oriented and early intervention for children, adolescents and adults.
Mental health is covered by coordination reform. That means focusing on prevention, good cooperation
between municipalities and hospitals and a continued restructuring of long-term residential care to
locally adapted measures supplemented by treatment in the specialist where necessary.
Labour's aim is that the financial instruments for mental health care in coordination reform
be in place as soon as practicable.

Rus - Prevention and Treatment
Labor will have a drug policy that helps prevent drug abuse and provide good care and treatment
to those who develop an addiction. Therefore Labor pursue policies that restrict access
to drugs, and where good national solutions that liquor store, a good pour policy and a clear
appraisal against the legalization of drugs are important cornerstones. We will fight drug addiction without
To combat the addict. Labor is concerned that people with addictions meet
with equality and respect. Help should be offered without any requirements on abstinence, while abstinence
must be a goal for most. Children of addicts must obtain a secure environment, and dependents must be paid
greater attention. Offer of help and treatment to families who need it,
must be strengthened.
By far the most injuries resulting from intoxication caused by alcohol. Labor will have an increased focus on
the negative aspects of alcohol use, not least the negative consequences that affect their families and
Otherwise third parties.
Labor will have greater transparency about alcohol abuse and remove any stigma that causes
people who need it, are too embarrassed to ask for help.
Rusbehandling is part of the Coordination Reform and Labor will use cooperation agreements
between municipalities and health actively, so that the addict treatment course is
planned and implemented in partnership between health and local government. This will not have at least
importance of aftercare. Labour's aim is that the financial instruments for substance abuse treatment in
coordination reform be put in place as quickly as practicable.

6) Building land further

The coast has been the country's lifeblood for many years. It is the source of value creation and settlement along
whole coast. We must develop the knowledge we have gained about the coast through the centuries
and ensuring continued innovation.
People working in the maritime industry creates values. Competence of Norwegian seamen, fishermen
and marine scientists are world class. Should we still be a world leader in the future, youth
appears the opportunities in the industry.
Solveig, 37, Haugesund. General manager in the maritime sector

Unified nation, build Norway further
Labor will have excellent communications and transportation facilities across the country. Roads, railways,
ports and airports helps to bind the country together and is essential for economic development and for that
people should be able to stay in the country. Both districts and cities' needs should be met. Increased accessibility,
improve safety and environmental concerns should form the basis for Labour's transport policy.
We carry out its biggest ever transport lift with record construction of roads, railways and ports.
This great effort must be continued in the coming years. To facilitate value creation throughout
country shall transport corridors prioritized. Transport needs increase, not least as a result of the
large expected population growth. Especially in and around the major urban areas, this will require a large
development of public transport and facilitation of cycling and walking. Growth in passenger transport
the major urban areas must be taken with public transport, cycling and walking. Local and regional authorities must
still be responsible for local and regional public transport. The large increase in transport demand
nevertheless suggests that the state as part of a reciprocal agreement with local and regional authorities in greater
extent than today helps finance public transport. Such agreements must include a comprehensive land use and
transportation planning and effective means to twist the use of transport by private car and over to the collective.
More freight to be moved from road and over the sea and rail and Labor will be compiled
one nærskipsstrategi for achieving this goal. Key elements of this nærskipsstrategien must be
renewal of the fleet, simplification of administrative procedures, improved competitive conditions for sea conditions
the way, and the development of ports as logistics hubs. We will continue to pursue development of ports
and fairways and good transshipment points. It is necessary to develop a port structure which helps
efficient loading and unloading. Also take several ports cooperate.
Good air is essential for commercial activities and settlements throughout the country. Scheme that
surplus airports pay for the unprofitable airports shall continue.
The big construction rate for both roads and railways in the coming years will require major
scheduling resources among municipalities and government agencies, good contract forms and a flexible
organization as to ensure good progress in the projects. Planning processes at municipal and state
level must be reviewed so that the plan period can be shortened.
The successful focus on road safety, including by building meeting-free roads, carry
avalanche protection measures and prioritize speed limitation and control, must continue so that the decline in the number of hits
casualties on Norwegian roads continues.
To get more people to use the bike is good for the environment, public health and to get less traffic jams.
Labor has ambitions for cycling initiatives, and will therefore facilitate the bicycle is a real
option for travel to work and school and in their spare time.
Labour will:
• Implement a national effort of investment, operation and maintenance of road, rail and sea route.
• The growth in passenger traffic in the largest urban areas should be taken by bus, rail, train, bicycle and
walk. We will therefore undertake a national boost for public transport in major urban areas.
We will do this through mutual agreements between the state, counties and municipalities.
• Prioritize transport corridors and trunk road network.
• Ensure predictable project financing of the major transport projects on its own
budget items.
• Facilitate the larger and coherent transport projects can be organized as
own projects that ensures efficient propulsion and reasonable contract forms.

down planning time for major infrastructure projects.
• Ensure municipal finances so that counties can fulfill its responsibility as the road owner and
responsible for local and regional public transport.
• Prioritize railway development in intercity triangle at airports and in other large metropolitan areas
where rail transport could cover a large part of the increase in transport demand.

• Initiate modernization of pilotage and renewal of farledsbevisordningen.
• Helping establish connecting cycle, establish bicycle expressways on selected
stretches and better opportunity for bicycle parking at public transport hubs.
• See ambulance and taxi supply and other relevant schemes. Transport services in rural areas in relation to
secure a good deal.
• Ensure taxi stand in a comprehensive public transit.

New momentum in residential construction
Housing is - next to labor, education and health - the most important for people's welfare. Most in Norway
live well and own their own home. Norwegian housing policy has been successful. In the early 1900s
we lived cramped and poor. Today we have the world's tallest residential standard. Labor is concerned
to build on what works well. In addition, there is a need to take a new approach, because the situation in
the housing market has changed. That people have a good and safe place to stay at an affordable price has been and
remains an important goal for the Labour Party. In 2009 we experienced a sharp deceleration in housing construction
as a result of the international financial crisis. Combined with strong population growth has led to
imbalance between supply and demand. Higher house prices have made it more difficult for many - especially
for young people - to establish themselves in their own homes. It has also led to a high level of debt in Norwegian households.
Labor believes it is an important political task to facilitate the build enough housing.
The state must ensure favorable framework conditions for housing construction. Municipalities must ensure and regulate enough area
for residential purposes, provide for quick building permits and building municipal rental housing. Labor
wants municipalities with a proactive and future-oriented housing policy must meet a constructive and
coordinated state.
Labor will continue to fight for those who currently leases land to residential or recreational property, should be
owners of their plots. Labour Party will therefore review the legislation with a view to considering the possibilities
to strengthen lessees puttable. Labor will also work to ensure that empty ground rent
will remain at a reasonable level that address the social housing considerations that underlie today
legislation.
Over the past few years is social housing work strengthened. The government has simplified and strengthened
housing allowance, never before have so many received home loans through the Housing Bank, and there are now more than 100 000
municipal rental housing in Norway. The social housing efforts must continue.
Labor will equate residential purposes with other considerations in densely populated areas. Generally, housing is given greater weight compared to other considerations. The county governors have in the treatment of municipal plans
place greater emphasis on the need for adequate housing in urban areas. We will review the Planning and
Building Act to remove unnecessary restrictions on new housing, restrict the right to appeal in building applications where it is being built in accordance with approved zoning and develop IT solutions that make online planning and building regulations possible in all municipalities so that application processes can be simplified
and streamlined.
Labour will:
• Setting clear targets for housing construction. We will establish public models for calculating future
building needs where it is calculated what must be built in different regions to keep pace with
population growth in the coming years. The national coordination of housing policy must
strengthened.
63

• Strengthen Housing Bank's role as the central government administrative and means of
housing construction including by increasing the Housing Bank credit facilities.
• Strengthen start-up loan scheme so that more young people can get loans for setting up a home.
• Impose municipalities to develop housing plans for long-term integrated land use
housing construction and development of infrastructure and transportation based on expected population growth
and municipal land access. We must exploit the area of ​​better cities. The plans must also address
opportunities for infill and renovation of existing housing stock.
• Avoid conflict of goals between various government agencies. Municipalities will meet a State
coordinated on their priorities. We will review how the State Department objections
practiced and see if there is a need for new rules.
• Consider open for several varieties of "from renting to owning" the public.
• Establish cooperation with various levels of government (county governors, municipalities and counties)
where one identifies the area as there are basically build limitations and
clearer these for quicker construction (Vestfold model).
• The municipalities prepare adequate land area, also through plots in municipal ownership.
• Review municipal influence in housing construction in cases where LNF areas reorganized as
residential purposes.
• Ensure that municipalities in pressure zones can regulate large housing projects which also provide
opportunity housing assistance for youth.
• Consider introducing a government loan scheme or other tools to facilitate the municipalities
can make strategic land purchases. The assessment will include municipal debt level depth.
• Promote increased development of non-commercial rental properties including through housing cooperatives, and
develop models where youth can gradually buy rental property.
• Intensifying student residential construction with the goal of 3000 built homes a year. Labor will increase
cost framework for student housing and increasing the grant for student housing at 50%.
• Prioritize areas with heavy pressure on student housing.
• Review quality requirements for student housing
• The municipalities can enter into partnership with local housing associations and other serious actors to
contribute to the realization of non-commercial rental properties.
• Assess the overall effects of the quality standards set for housing at all levels, and
Consider geographically differentiated requirements in the building regulations.
• Contribute to increasing efficiency in the construction industry by promoting innovation, use of public
building models (BIM) and focus on more apprentices through stricter requirements for tendering, procurement and
contracting authorities when the agreement is signed.
• Facilitate funding for rebuilding of homes to prepare a good old age
own home.
• Ensure that the Housing Bank has instruments to finance housing in rural areas.
• Consider measures to limit inflationary fortune placement.

A diverse country
Norway is a diverse country. Labor believes there must be an overriding goal for all national
policies to preserve this national identity, this enriching diversity, and utilize resources and
opportunities in all parts of the country. Labor wants everyone to be able to settle wherever they want, and that
we shall have equal living conditions in all parts of the country. Also to safeguard our national interests there
important to ensure the main features of the settlement.
Access to skilled jobs is crucial to developing attractive living environment. Rural and
regional policy must therefore be more strongly oriented towards the creation of skilled jobs in
districts, both on the basis of competence needs and development in traditional industries,
in new industries and welfare services. Localization of new state resource jobs must
underpin dynamic regions. Labour's strategic focus on the northern regions contribute
also for renewed efforts in the northernmost areas.
Labor believes that further development in the individual districts must be based on a targeted effort to
develop opportunities that exist in the individual regions. This must be done both through general measures
and a policy tailored to the individual regions characteristics. Regional advantages are mainly also national
64

advantage. The development of skills must underpin development opportunities that exist in the individual
regions partly because educational and research oriented towards the regional advantages.
In areas that have temporary restructuring needs or special or persistent challenges, it must
inserted particular effort.
In addition to employment, access to welfare services and a broad service and cultural importance for
providing attractive living environments throughout the country. Should we ensure this, we need to see the offer of individual
regions in context. Labor believes therefore that it is necessary to develop viable
commutes regions, with strong regional centers in order to safeguard such center functions. For us
there is no contradiction between strong cities and strong districts - they are interdependent.
The development of the transport service must build up under such a region enlargement.
Labor will maintain an equitable mail offers for the same price throughout the country. Postal services is a
important part of the infrastructure in Norway and a prerequisite for settlement and development throughout the country. In
districts should we have postal delivery 6 days a week.
Labor wants a vibrant democracy both locally and regionally. Municipalities play a
crucial role for welfare and economic development, and to ensure a vibrant local democracy.
Labor sees a need for elected governance at national, regional and local levels.
County authorities have responsibility to pursue a policy for the development of their region so that we can exploit
opportunities in all parts of the country. Municipal structure must ensure functional, good and equal
welfare services throughout the country.
Labour will:
• Secure the main features of the settlement, to facilitate development and ensure equal living conditions in all
parts of the country.
• Develop viable commutes regions where there is access to varied and specialize work,
commercial, service, welfare and cultural facilities.
• Develop regional power centers in all parts of the country.
• Contribute to the subsidy for local study centers to ensure access to lifelong learning throughout
country.
• Retain graded payroll and investment grants.
• Develop instruments so that counties where several or all municipalities outside the
regional policy area with the basis to drive regional development throughout the county.
• The new government activities generally will be outside Oslo and contribute to achieving the distriktsog regional policy objectives. Do not make extensive migrations of existing state
businesses.
• Maintain equal postal services to equal price across the country.
• As far as possible, move the counting time for new residents in growth municipalities so they get
financial means the actual number of inhabitants.

Svalbard
Svalbard is an important part of the High North Strategy. A continued focus on Svalbard will help Norway
marks its presence in the Arctic. Location far north, with permanent buildings and
excellent opportunities for business and tourism in interaction with the environment make Svalbard a rich and exciting
area. Svalbard community will continue to be based on research, coal mining and tourism. In addition, we want
port operations will provide the basis for future activities.
Labor will ensure employment of Svalbard and make sure Longyearbyen to remain
a family community that is good to live in. By using new and innovative technology and new solutions we can
create new jobs, while respecting the environment are safeguarded.
Labour will:
• Develop Longyearbyen by contributing to increased employment.
• Starting work on the new port that facilitates future development of Svalbard.
65

• Continue coal mining on Svalbard.
• Ensure that the rescue and emergency response capacity is adapted to the needs of the area.

The good life in the city
Strong cities and regional centers that work closely with the research, business and employment is
powerful locomotive for their regions and for the country. These are roles that Labor will strengthen a
offensive urban policy, which facilitates infrastructure, dampens pressures in the housing market and ensure
expertise in jobs in business, culture and public duties.
Population growth in cities and suburban areas creates traffic congestion and queuing. Labor wants
therefore to move most of the growth in passenger traffic over the bus, rail, train and bicycle. People should
could travel efficiently and environmentally friendly to work, school and leisure time. Emissions from road traffic affects both
quality of life and environment. By focusing more on public transit, we can lay the foundations for greener cities
while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We will do this by binding cooperation between government,
county, municipalities and towns.
It is being built today to homes in the pressure areas in urban areas. Many struggle to obtain
somewhere to stay, whether to own or rent. Labor will conduct an active housing policy to meet
housing need. We will develop more housing, build closer where this is consistent with a good living environment, and
secure a housing policy that adapts life phases. But cities also need green breathing holes and
social meeting places, sanctuaries that provide nature experiences and encouraging recreational or activity.
The biggest cities face special challenges related to crime. Labor will create safe
urban environment and work with preventive activities by equalizing economic and social disparities and
fight poverty and substance abuse. We will also maintain a present and effective policing.
Labor looks at diversity as a strength for creativity, exchange of experiences and contacts
with other countries and cultures. The experience young people have of growing up in a more diverse Norway makes us
better equipped to face an increasingly global community. To master the Norwegian language and culture
Tags are key to succeeding in the large Norwegian community. It is also important to create and
used communal meeting places where we can share a social community. A diverse cultural and sports facilities is a
good basis for this community.
Livelihoods Challenges, environmental challenges and integration are issues that have other dimensions in big cities
than elsewhere. Labor therefore believes there is a need for integrated area initiatives in areas
with special challenges. Experience from area initiatives in Oslo has been positive. These must
continued and expanded. Labor will transfer relevant experiences from Oslo to other cities in the country
our. There will be a focus on urban renewal area and development in areas where housing standards are low and the
Social differences are apparent.
Labor sees a need for changes in the municipal structure. Changes in current
kommuneinndeling is necessary to ensure equally good welfare services for all citizens, in
functional and sustainable communities. Where geographical and social considerations dictate change
municipal boundaries or merger of municipalities, the state must positively encourage it. Amendments
in municipal structures should normally be based on local desires. Labor believes that individual municipalities
not be able to stop the changes that are appropriate in the regional considerations.
Today's administrative division in the metropolitan area hampers a comprehensive land use and
transportation planning. Labour will initiate a separate assessment of the division into
metropolitan area, where appropriate, other metropolitan areas.
Labour will:
• Facilitate increased housing construction in cities.
• The growth in passenger traffic in the largest urban areas taken by bus, rail, trains, cycling and walking. We
will therefore implement a national boost for public transport in major urban areas. This will
we do through a binding agreement between the state, counties and municipalities.

• Continue and expand the zone initiatives in areas of the capital and some larger cities where there are
particular challenges with integration, language and living conditions.
• Expanding the experiment with free SFO / activity school to include more areas

More safety - less crime
Confident people create safe communities. Small differences and equal opportunities means that we in Norway
strong trust between people and between people and the authorities. A welfare policy that seeks
solutions together, equalizes differences and equal opportunity is therefore also a good policy to
preventing and combating crime. And we have a good criminal policy, which responds quickly
and rehabilitates, it's a good welfare policy. Labor believes that safety is one of the main
values ​​a society can have. It is a public responsibility.
The government's main task is to protect the population in the country. Labor dwellings
preparedness policy on fundamental principles such as responsibility, proximity, equality and cooperation. We look at safety,
legal protection and availability as key values ​​for achieving the goals of justice policy.

A close and strong police
Police have primary responsibility for fighting and preventing crime. The police must be effective,
professional and provide excellent services to the population. We need a close and strong police available
to drive crime fighting and prevention.
To create security locally, the police must be visible and available locally. What matters is that the police
act quickly and correctly. Prevention must also be anchored locally. All relevant sectors of the public
must contribute. School, child welfare, health care and police must work together to create confidence. On
many places plays NGOs and others an important role in this work.
To achieve these goals requires a more effective utilization of resources than today. Police officers must be used
to police work, and working time must be used more efficiently. We must have a clear picture of crime and risk
society, the expectations of what tasks the police to solve and how it may be able to
to solve them.
For people to feel secure, the police must be visible and accessible. A fried neighborhood police is important
for preventing and combating crime. Sheriff structure must be maintained in order to
offering services where people live and to conduct effective prevention and ensure law and order. This should not be
prevent changes by local desire to improve services for the population.
The police districts must be organized so that they are robust devices. It must be based on
geography, police tasks and crime picture. Labor will have stronger and more competent
for research and ensure robust operations centers. It will require a reduction in the number
police districts.
Police have less bureaucratic, pure administrative positions must be released so that police officers can spend more
time out in local communities and the police must adopt new and more efficient technologies so that resources collected
used better.
Labor will continue with high admission to the Police Academy to continue the strengthening of
Because staffing in the police. That the police should have the confidence of the population must reflect the population.
In particular, the proportion of students from minority backgrounds who are admitted at the Police Academy, too low.

67

For the police to be able to work more efficiently and be accessible to the public needed the good and
modern technology. The key to future police lies not in technology itself but in police
ability to use it to solve their tasks. New ICT platform must be in place and current systems
must be used better. It is also essential that the police have expertise in crime that takes place
over the internet. Police must be given the necessary equipment and expertise to combat and prevent this
threat.
Domestic violence is a violation of basic human rights that the public has a responsibility to
preventing and fighting. It is a very serious kind of crime that affects the victim particularly hard. We
must become better at detecting, clarify and condemn this type of crime.
Labor will reinforce efforts against violence, which particularly affects women and children. Police must
prioritize these cases, efforts must be intensified and competence raised. Often detected abuse
contacts with the authorities, and both the victim and any children may need assistance from
more service for a long time. It must therefore be made to ensure comprehensive and coordinated assistance. Then
the employees have the necessary skills and plans for action so they know how such serious matters
should be handled.
Labour will:
• Have an accessible police across the country.
• Conduct a police analysis to get a good scientific basis for future organization of the police and sheriff's agency.
• Continue to increase resources for the police.
• Ensure continued high admission to the Police Academy to meet staffing targets for the police.
• Ensure that the police utilize new technology to provide high quality and efficient services.
• Enhance efforts to combat domestic violence through prevention and fight better.
• Work to ensure that all municipalities have action plans against domestic violence.
• Increase research on domestic violence.
• Reduce the number of police districts.
• Adopt investigation plans to ensure effective treatment and good quality of investigation
of rape cases.
• Go against a general arming of the police.

Civil Protection and Emergency Planning
Labor will give priority to civil protection - also from a broader perspective than
justice sector. It is thus crucial that the relevant agencies cooperate well and tight. This applies both in the
prevention and in exercises and training. We need a continuous treatment chain,
from rescue work via pre-hospital services for hospital treatment. Interdisciplinary efforts will also
require multidisciplinary training. Labor will ensure a targeted effort of high quality in the country.
Weapons legislation must be tightened. The ban on semiautomatic weapons must be established by law, and
possibility for exceptions must be tightened. It should also be considered if the number of allowable shots in the magazine and
Chamber shall be limited. The conditions for acquiring, owning and possessing such weapons must be stricter. Police
control of weapons must be strengthened.
The ordinary police is the most important and most fundamental resource related to immediate action.
Therefore police capability for preparedness strengthened. It requires plans and exercises as well as cooperation and
cooperation. The capacity of the police must be better exploited. This should not come at the expense of the police capability and
capacity to engage in preventive work, investigate crimes and engage in contact and confidence-building
work.
It is vital for our confidence that we have a security service that is well enough equipped to solve
its social mission. Security and intelligence services should have a good overview of the threat.
Services must be well equipped so that they can manage to uncover and avert most
possible. Weighing the need to fight crime against the need for privacy is a
central issue in efforts to secure a democratic society.
68

During crises must be efficient and robust systems for mobilization between districts. For
to strengthen the national emergency resources will be established a national emergency response center in Oslo.
It is important to get the most out of society's total preparedness resources. Cooperation between
police and defense will contribute to this. The police must be able to draw on resources and personnel from
defense in a crisis situation. Guidelines and limit times for assistance of defense must be ready
and well communicated.
Labor will draw on the resources of the voluntary sector and civil society in the work
preparedness and civil protection. We can not afford not to use good and efficient resources
in this work. Often it is those who are initially present, and they can at an early stage operate alone.
Close to local communities and local conditions, knowledge and expertise of the organizations
and commitment of the volunteers makes these into a powerful resource that Labour wants to draw
closely in preparedness and safety. Therefore we want NGOs to be included in
municipal emergency plans.
Labour will:
• Continue work on emergency networks.
• Strengthen operational centers.
• Strengthen coordination and utilization of all emergency resources.
• Strengthen PST.
• Facilitate better coordination and cooperation in rescue.
• Establish clear procedures for public efforts in the rescue.
• The NGOs included in the municipal contingency plans.
• Introduce SMS notification to emergency services.

Court and correctional services
It will not pay to commit crime in Norway. Crime be discovered and solved. Fast
reaction, which shows the seriousness of the crime, is crucial for legal certainty and for consumers
sense of justice. Penalties need to be quick. It requires good capacity with the police,
prosecutors, court and correctional services.
Labor will continue to increase capacity at Norwegian prisons, to ensure enough detention places, get
down atonement queues and facilitate a better content in atonement. Then we must also strengthen its workforce
and train more prison officers, and ensure that employees with competence given the opportunity
formal qualifications.
A growing proportion of prisoners are foreign nationals. It poses new challenges. Many
include communication between inmates and staff difficult because of language problems.
Labor will work for even more companies may serve his sentence in his home country. We will also continue to apply
alternative atonement forms. This requires a strengthening of probation.
Labor will maintain strict criminal policy against regulars and organized crime and that
can contribute to rapid and effective rehabilitation for those who want it back to society. This requires
employees with vocational training and expertise. Measures førstegangssonere is important. Very many
of inmates are addicts and need treatment to be brought back into society and not
remain regulars. Education and job training and good supervision after release are important measures
that inmates quickly to come back to the community. NGOs sitting many places with
resources and considerable expertise that is essential in this work. Correctional Service must increase and improve
cooperation with other government agencies to ensure a good return to society for the individual
inmates.
It is a measure that young people should not be in prison and that alternative forms of sentences shall
used. Youth punishment adopted by Parliament must be implemented. This means that there must
hired youth coordinators at all the country's 22 Mediation Service. Conflict councils should be further developed so that
they can expand their field further.
69

There is no security without due process. Legislation must maintain the right balance between
privacy, freedom and security. Labor will have effective courts, with good capacity and high
expertise. They should have access to modern technology and the expertise to use it. Structure
the courts must be adapted to these objectives. In order to preserve the rule of law in society must all have
access to good legal aid. Possibility of free legal aid for all is an important contribution to ensure this. Conflicts
should be solved at the lowest possible level. Commitment to a more accessible legal aid scheme and extrajudicial
dispute resolution methods such as mediation board will contribute to it.
Labour will:
• Increase atonement capacity at Norwegian prisons and ensure enough detention space.
• Provide more employees in Norwegian prisons and that these have vocational training.
• Contribute to more foreign prisoners may serve in their home country.
• Increase the use of alternative incarcerated forms, including an expansion of the system of electronic
control of the country.
• Inserting special measures for groups that are vulnerable to repetition, as young and
addicts.
• Coordinate implementation of inmates through NAV.
• Introduce youth coordinators in all conflict areas.
• Develop a better atonement offerings for women.
• That women should be able to zone separated from men.
• Investigate solution to introduce audio and video recordings in the courts.

Voluntary community
We live and develop together with others. To belong to small and large communities contribute both to
security and freedom. Labor believes that joint solutions are the foundation for the Norwegian
welfare society. They shall ensure equal opportunities for all. But a society is something more. We can not - and
should not - be expected that the welfare state solver and finance all welfare needs. We can not - and should not -
leave it to the public to attend all care, all care, all participation, - it would quickly become a cold and
insensitive society. Many people want to contribute to a better life for their fellow men, to the development and
well-being in their communities, to be active together with others in sport or culture. This is what
is civil society.
The voluntary sector should not take over tasks from the public, although they many times
can perform tasks on behalf of the public so NGOs have long made within
substance abuse treatment, different health tasks M.W. But the voluntary sector will trigger and stimulate a
human involvement beyond the public sector. Organize a care that goes beyond the the
government can provide. Organize sporting life and culture that enriches the lives of both those involved and to the
who otherwise have enjoyed the activity. Voluntary commitment has an intrinsic value and contribute to the good life for
individual and Labor want the voluntary sector should complement the welfare state.
Norway has an active and well developed voluntary sectors. Labor will strengthen the voluntary sector and
promote interaction between the public and the voluntary sector so that solidarity and community in
society can be further strengthened. Labor believes that the public sector must support this
volunteers work in a manner that is at least possible strain on organizational life. We must be careful
so we formalize the has value in that it is informally. At the same time we must of course have
adequate assurance that public money is being properly used. The voluntary sector must be safeguarded well financially
in the years ahead.
There are over 10 million members in NGOs in Norway, but participation is socially
lopsided. People with high wages and high education participate to a greater extent than others. Labor is concerned
to lower the threshold to participate and wants good cooperation between central and local government and voluntary for
facilitating it.
Voluntary activity is changing, partly because of a general individualization of society.
This helps to put the voluntary sector under pressure. To maintain and develop a comprehensive voluntary
sector in Norway is required various measures to ensure the recruitment of active and officers.
70

Policy for the voluntary sector must also be adapted to the new forms of volunteerism and encourage
Engagement also when it assumes new forms.
Labour will:
• Facilitate closer cooperation between the public sector and NGOs, such
that voluntary work can reinforce and complement public welfare services.
• Opening more partnerships between government and the voluntary sector in the relevant areas, as
preparedness and inclusion.
• Coordinate and facilitate the public schemes for grants to volunteer work both in terms of
application deadlines, application form, reporting procedures, etc.
• Ensure that voluntary registry works so that it helps to improve and simplify interaction
between the voluntary sector and public authorities and contribute to increased knowledge of the voluntary sector, and
so it is easy to use also for clubs and associations where all representatives are young and inexperienced.
• Ensure that the VAT compensation scheme to NGOs increased to 1.2 billion
million in 2014.
• Facilitate that all children and young people are given the opportunity to participate in activities regardless of their parents
economic and social situation in that children of families who live on social benefits, receive
activity support.
• Contribute to cooperation between voluntary and schools to offer recreational activities associated
school day.
• Strengthen the local voluntary organizations by conducting Kulturløftet and by giving the volunteers
culture a larger share of Norwegian company profit (18 percent) by 2015, including
by strengthening Frifond, which provides support to children and young people across the country can get a
broader and better locally leisure.
• Continue support for voluntary organizations through the Grassroots share in Norwegian Tipping.
• Continue the establishment of several volunteer centers in the municipalities.
• Through municipalities facilitate that NGOs can gain easier access to
union offices, meeting space and rehearsal rooms.
• Facilitate creation of web portals which brings together organizations, tasks and people
wishing to participate in voluntary work.

Culture - experiences and participation
Labor will through Kulturløftet ensure people access to cultural experiences across the country. We want
a culture that is diverse and where we have common meeting places. Where one can be both consumer and
practitioner of culture. We want a culture that appeals both to the masses and the special interests, a cultural life
which embraces both children and adult - that a culture for all! Labor emphasizes culture
intrinsic value.
It is the interplay between cultural life different actors providing a comprehensive cultural policy. Not least, it
important to strengthen efforts in the counties that do not have large cultural institutions and thus gets a smaller share
of the state cultural initiative. Also art forms such as theater, opera, dance, film and various music genres,
shall have nurtured throughout Norway. Meanwhile, everyday culture is important, therefore we are keen to strengthen
low threshold prices, as libraries.
Other activities are unevenly distributed. The cultural schoolbag and other schemes that give children access to
art and culture, is an important priority for the Labour Party. Good conditions is about more
than weekdays, it's about having something to look forward to and participate in. Therefore, we want closer cooperation
between child welfare, sports and culture and opening of the municipal commitment to child also may mean
Hiring a cultural worker.
Culture is also about the participation, about being part of a community, whether it's in the band,
the theater or the public. Volunteerism carries much of the culture of Norway. It is important to
underpin this and create good links between volunteerism and culture.
Future elderly must act even more about the content of care. Culture, participation and cooperation
with the voluntary sector is important to get a geriatric care which is also about joy.
71

An active cultural policy contributes to strengthening economic development and creativity. It creates jobs and is
good regional policy. Culture is also food. Labor will focus on Norwegian art and design in greater
degree than is done today. Especially with regard to an international market where today there is a significant
interest for Norwegian art and design, this is important.
In addition, the arts and culture to a greater understanding between people, inclusion and integration. A
confidence in their own culture and language is an important prerequisite for being able to understand others. It is important that
multicultural perspective made visible in all fields of culture. International cooperation is also important.
Our cultural heritage is an important part of our heritage. It is therefore important to preserve historic buildings
and cultural sites so that these too can be experienced in the future.
Labour will:
• Develop a Culture Lifting III in consultation with cultural. Kulturløftet I and II has lifted Norway as
cultural nation. This work will be continued.
• Maintain 1% of the budget for cultural purposes also after 2014.
• Provide arts available to all children who want it - partly in cooperation with the SFO and on
ettermiddagstid.
• Define requirements for what arts should contain.
• Expanding the system of culture short for youth.
• The libraries will become even more important cultural information, knowledge and culture centers than they
is today. Library services should be free.
• Strengthen support schemes for international launch of Norwegian design, art and culture.
• Develop the Cultural Rucksack, the cultural packed lunch and the cultural
Walking Stick, in order to reach even more.
• Lead a proactive language policy and ensure Norwegian language as a full and functional language at all
areas of society.
• Using the government support to encourage diversity in the film industry.

Sports and activities joy for all
Labor will conduct a boost for the sport. The sport is the largest popular movement. Through
thousands of activities are given children, youth and adults offer personal development, interaction possibilities
and social community through training, competitive activity and volunteer work. Sport is an arena
to develop good attitudes, and it has great social importance. Holistic upbringing,
improving public health, positive integration and useful organizational experience are good examples of sports
importance.
Width The sport provides training, joy and fellowship for many. It is also recreational sports that give
basis for elite sport spring. When Norway is able to assert itself so well internationally, it is precisely
because we have a sports movement that is concerned about both of recruiting broad and cultivate talents.
Labor will stimulate further development of elite sport performance culture, values ​​and diversity,
both within sports organizations, but also by fostering collaboration across different
development environments and performance environments in the public sector and industry. Labor will work to ensure that
diversity is not lost through that market forces alone will support investment opportunities for the
some elite sport environment.
Labor will give all people opportunities to play sports and be active out of their own
desires and ambitions. We will have good conditions for sport at all levels, and especially strengthen children's and
youth sports. All children and youth should be ensured proper swimming lessons.
Good, functional sports facilities, along with good training and leadership, the most important contribution
the sport's efforts to create good activities for children and youth and to increase the physical
activity in the population. The gap between the need for sports facilities and the available lottery has led
to a lag in heavy construction. Therefore, the Labour Party decided to change the distribution formula to make
more money for the sport. There are special challenges to infrastructure shortages in urban areas and in areas with
great growth, and plants with many users must be prioritized.
72

The Norwegian model is based on voluntary efforts. The membership-based NGOs
make a great effort for active neighborhoods and is an important democratic resource in society at large.
The voluntary sporting and organizational life creates activity and allow for participation. Many
people put down a large volunteer work in the member-based organizations. Volunteerism
in sport is an important contribution to addressing important social issues such as public health and social inclusion.
Labor will facilitate that volunteer in sport receive support to develop their own competence
and leadership. That many are involved in organizations, sports and other volunteer work is helping to
creating a society with stronger community and increased trust.
Labour will:
• Conduct a broad focus on health and physical activity in cooperation with the sport and
outdoor organizations.
• Follow up the change in the distribution formula so that sport and the local voluntary organizations get a greater
share of the Norwegian company profit.
• Build more sports facilities, particularly in densely populated areas, densely populated areas and big cities.
• Work to ensure that loans of public facilities and schools to sports activities for children and youth under 18
years to the extent possible should be free.
• Facilitate the voluntary work in the field receive support to develop its own expertise and
leadership.
• Support and encourage teams and organizations to include minorities.
• Support the development of diversity in elite sport and counteract that only market forces will govern
operating basis.
• Stimulate the development of elite sport performance culture and values.

Religion and belief diversity
Religion and Spirituality plays an important role in Norwegian society, both for the community and for
individuals. Everyone has the right to practice religion or belief in line with freedom of religion and within
democratic rules. The diversity of religious and belief is a common good that the public
should facilitate and contribute financially to, through an actively supportive religion and belief politics. Trosog belief communities constitute a substantial part of the voluntary sector.
We want the public to stimulate joint actions and dialogue between different religions and beliefs, and
Inter-denominational within faiths. Dialogue and knowledge increases mutual understanding and
thus strengthening community. The religious diversity is reflected today in a variety of venues
the public space. We should have headroom and tolerance for people with different religious affiliation and different way
live with their faith.
Both historically and culturally is the Norwegian Church in a unique position in Norway. Through constitutional amendments
in 2012 states that it shall be the national church. Around 78% of the population are members
of this, and Labour's aim is that the members shall constitute a democratic force that ensures a
national church that is open and inclusive space for diverse religious needs.
It is important to further develop arrangements with elections to the governing bodies of the church, and Labor
believes that the electoral system should ensure that members of the local, regional and central level must be organized
through direct elections and conducted simultaneously with and in premises adjacent to kommuneog county council elections. For Labor is essential that the gradual independence makes no and
democratization of the Norwegian Church continues.
Labour will:
• Ensuring equal treatment of religious and belief.
• Creating a more integrated religion and belief in policy dialogue with belief communities.
• Continue efforts to create more belief neutral ceremony premises.
• Increase access to civil marriage men.
• Contribute to ensure all citizens equal ceremonies at weddings and funerals.
• Support the Norwegian Church in its efforts to further develop the electoral system.
• Continue the Christian education reform.
73

• Ensure that dependents receive adequate information about funerals, including that they receive unsolicited
overview of costs associated with funeral homes and extent of and the right to burial support
so that everyone can contribute to a dignified celebration of that of his family life.
• Change Marriage Act § 16 to be denominational, and not mention or regulate solemnizer in The
Norwegian Church in particular. Religious communities adopt its own liturgy.

Indigenous peoples and national minorities
Labor believes mainstream society has a responsibility to ensure good conditions for the Sami language,
culture, business and society, and combating discrimination against indigenous peoples and minorities.
Labor's aim is that the Sami should have real opportunities to learn their mother tongue, use it in
everyday life and hand it to the next generation.
Labour will therefore continue the government's responsibility to fund tuition in Sami,
and strengthen efforts to preserve and develop the Sami languages ​​and Sami identity.
Labor would Sami politics prioritize the use of the financial and human resources in
high school, elementary school and kindergarten, in language work and in healthcare.
That the Sami culture must be able to develop further, it is important that young people choose to settle
in the core Sami areas. These areas are today largely characterized by population decline.
For Labour, it is important to preserve the traditional Saami trades, but it must also
taken new and more grip for business development in these areas. We must develop in order to preserve community.
Many national minorities have long historical ties to Norway. Jews, Kvens / Norwegian Finns, Roma,
Romanies and Forest Finns are national minorities. Labour will seek to ensure that these groups can
develop their identity, cultural history and its language in Norway.
Labour will:

• Ensure that there is enough Sami teaching materials of satisfactory quality in schools.
• The bilingual municipalities receive compensation for their expenses and that bilingualism funds
be made more flexible.
• The students in the Saami areas shall be able to choose Sami instead of regional languages.
• Contribute to more international literature being translated into Sami, and that children's literature
should be prioritized.
• Educate several Sami-speaking teachers, kindergarten teachers and health and social workers.
• Increase the number of Sami kindergarten.
• Strengthen the funding for Sami culture.

Diversity and equal opportunity
Labor believes that diversity is fundamentally positive. With the recent immigration to Norway
we have a more diverse population with different cultural backgrounds, different traditions and different religious
affiliation. We view diversity as a strength, creativity, exchange of experiences and contacts
against other countries and cultures. The diversity makes it possible for individuals to decide how they will
live their lives. The basis of Labour's integration policies lies in the integration policy
document, "Diversity and opportunities", which was adopted at the Congress in 2011.
When society becomes more diverse, it must also be clear in its foundation. Through many years
we have built up a set of rules, traditions and values ​​that are common to us all and that defines our
society. These should not be removed at. Democracy, rule of law, human rights and gender equality
are such values. Within the framework of this clear foundation can grow diversity.
Labor sees the community as one of the single most essential human resources, also
when society becomes more diverse. We should be clear on the cornerstone of the Norwegian
social contract, that all people have rights and obligations.
74

The key to successful integration is good Norwegian skills. Norwegian language is admission to increased
participation in society and the basis for social mobility. Therefore Labor constantly review
measures that underpins this, including through the Norwegian training arenas where immigrants
participates, as in introduction programs, in school and in the workplace. We want a good and relevant
Norwegian instruction that is practical and enables people to participate in various parts of society.
Labor require passing test after training when applying for Norwegian citizenship.
Language instruction begins in kindergarten. We will strengthen language mapping in four-year control
to determine whether the children need additional language stimulation to be equipped to cope with school.
Parents have the primary responsibility for ensuring that children are prepared for school. A more coherent school day where all
also will be offered help with homework will be more socially equalizing and inclusive. Labor believes
It is critical that students not be divided into classes on the basis of linguistic background. Norwegian shall be
common language in schools and classes must be made for this.
Work is key to strong individuals, families safe and a well-functioning society. One of the most important
objectives of the integration policy is to ensure that immigrants can quickly enter the labor market and be
financially self-supporting.
The main rule in Norwegian working life should be that you can dress up and highlight their religious identity
you will. Within each public authority roles is still difficult to combine a neutral
role with garments and symbols that clarifies an identity or religious affiliation. This particularly applies
police, prosecution and judges, which exerts force against civilians. Labor will not be permitted
bears visible religious symbols.
In a labor market that is becoming increasingly global, there will be a competitive advantage for Norway if we
manage to get more from minority groups into the labor market. We know that language is the main barrier for
getting many into the workforce. An important task will be to immigrant women with low skills to
qualify for participation in the workplace.
Labour will:
• That all who come to Norway to stay or work receive information on duties and rights
in Norwegian society.
• Introduce offer for 300 hours of Norwegian language and social training for migrant workers and their families
of the European Economic Area who are in Norway for more than six months.
• That everyone has the right and duty to Norwegian language and social studies education, to conduct a
final test. This must be passed to obtain Norwegian citizenship.
• Ensure that children are not used as interpreters in the public sector.
• Make the Norwegian education more differentiated and tailored to individual needs. It must be facilitated
for alternative teaching methods to the theory and teaching blackboard, especially for those who are illiterate or
have little schooling in the first place.
• Better information to parents about the opportunities for education and work in Norway.
• Continue and expand the "Second Chance" about a qualification program for immigrants who after several years in
Norway is still not working.
• Working for the government agencies reflect the population composition as well as possible.
• Make it easier to get adjusted its foreign formal qualifications to Norwegian requirements.

7) Norway in World

The world's eyes are directed to the north. Never before has interest in the northern areas and the Barents region have been
larger internationally. Northern Norway's most important strategic priority. Knowledge and
Value Creation is the common thread in the High North policy and the key to development, growth and influence in
north. Innovative research creates jobs. Knowledge of security policy developments or
emergency purposes will be crucial in the future.
Espen Barth Eide, Norwegian Foreign Minister

77

World and we
That domestic politics is all foreign policy on political priorities. Labour Party
Foreign policy must safeguard Norwegian interests and contribute to international solidarity in an era
of increasing globalization, rapid knowledge and technology shifts and changes in political conditions.
Labour's core values ​​founded on freedom, solidarity, dignity, equality and popular
participation gives direction to our policy both at home and abroad. Arbeiderbevegelsens ethos
about creating and sharing is normative. With a rapidly changing world, these basic principles
compass we are navigating. At the same time we have with us a management system, an active state and a well-developed
democracy with good consultation and cooperation arrangements here home. It provides a valuable
experience to share with others internationally.

Values ​​and rights
Based on the labor movement's history, and in recognition of the pillars of the Norwegian
model, respect for human rights especially important for Labor. Freedom of speech, the right
to organize themselves and to negotiate lay the foundation for democracy, the emergence of strong civil society
and equitable distribution. Respect for human rights including social, trade union rights and
Rights of Indigenous Peoples is an important premise for the labor movement involvement. It will characterize our
foreign policy.
It is a fundamental prerequisite for freedom and democracy that everyone should have the same opportunities
regardless of gender, ethnicity, level of functioning, or sexual orientation. In many places we are now seeing increased
extremism and increased pressure on and discrimination against minorities. Labor will contribute to the fight against
discrimination and protection of minority rights, getting increased attention. Fight against
intolerance, hate speech and extremism must be strengthened.
Work internationally to ensure human rights and children's rights is important for Norway. We
has joined the Convention and made the current Norwegian law. Norwegian courts directed
by the Convention in its treatment. The third optional Additional Protocol to the CRC
establishes an advisory appellate body for children's rights under the Convention.
Labor will assess the advantages and disadvantages of ratifying the Convention based on assessment
to assess the Convention's political, legal and judicial consequences.
A just world is also an equal world. Women's active participation in society creates development
and growth. Labor believes that Norway should be a champion of gender equality, children and women
rights, both in contact with other countries and in international fora. Norway should take an international
responsibility to strengthen efforts to combat human trafficking and combating sexual violence. Sexual violence
continues to be an integral part of modern warfare, both through strategic use of rape and
as a method of destroying social norms. Labor believes that Norway should continue to take on a
management responsibility for the implementation of resolution 1325 in the areas where the UN is present. Women
are subjected to sexual violence or rape, must be guaranteed the opportunity to abortion services and follow-up in
war zones.
Labor will continue to work against child and maternal mortality, and continue to strengthen its efforts
sexual and reproductive health rights.
As part of the international labor movement, we will still go in the front to promote the right
to decent work. In many countries, workers exploited and victims of child labor
and poor working conditions. The recognition of the ILO core conventions will continue to represent an important
main issue for the Labour Party.
Labour will:
• Working to defend and propagate the universal human rights, and a world free from torture
and the death penalty.
• Campaign for the right to decent working conditions within the ILO's core conventions.

78

• Focus on gender equality in our foreign and development policy. We will work to ensure that women gain greater power
and influence in society and in issues related to their own lives and health.
• Work to ensure that rape in war zones classified as weapons / tactics in war in the Rome Statute to
The International Criminal Court (ICC)
• That Norway will work to abolish the political restrictions that currently exist in access to
abortion services.
• Combating discrimination against lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people (LGBT).
• Work to strengthen minority rights in our foreign policy.
• To confront intolerance, hate speech and extremism in all forms and shades.

Global governance
The major challenges facing the international community, shatters national borders and must meet at
strengthened international cooperation. The climate crisis, the economic crisis, growing inequality and social unrest,
terrorist threats and international crime can only be solved jointly. Today's global institutions must
become more representative and effective, and they must have better monitoring and sanctions. This
requires reforms that reduce the country's ability to exercise a veto.
The UN and the international rule of law is the cornerstone of Norwegian foreign policy. The UN must be reformed,
streamlined and become more representative. UN Security Council must reflect the changing power relations
in the world. Labor wants a fundamental reform of the UN Security Council. There must be a requirement to
UN and its specialized agencies on good governance and good results. The coordination between the various UN agencies must be improved at the country level, and they need to work more closely with local civil society for
to become more relevant and legitimate. World Bank and IMF must also be more open and democratic, so that
also developing countries have greater influence.
An open and regulated trade system provides predictability for trade and businesses and are a prerequisite
for fair trade. Through WTO we will strive for further development of the international
commerce system, also in a way which safeguards Norwegian interests. New global trade agreements must
aim to ensure that the country working out of poverty, can participate in international trade.
Trade agreements must protect the environment and labor rights. Labor will work to
strengthening the WTO in the face of rising economic nationalism and protectionism.
Labour will:
• Reforming the UN so that the organization becomes more efficient, democratic and representative.
• Go for a fundamental reform of the UN Security Council so that it reflects the current global
power relations in a better way. In addition, we see that the veto should be curtailed.
• Working for a new, development-oriented WTO agreement. The trade-distorting internal support in
industrialized countries must be reduced.
• Removing the remaining Norwegian export subsidies and work for a ban on export subsidies
WTO. Labor wants Norway actively supports programs such as Aid for Trade
that puts developing countries are able to participate in world trade.
• Work to ensure that requirements for good labor standards and decent work be included in a new WTO round.
• Expanding EFTA's network of free trade agreements to new countries with emerging markets, including in
Africa.
• That Norway should stipulate that emergency programs as far as possible to protect the unprivileged in
countries that helped, that they do not impair the ability to safeguard public welfare and not based
on principles of privatization of essential public goods.

Northern Areas
Labor sees the northern areas as Norway's most important strategic
foreign policy. In these areas we have fundamental national interests and security policy
challenges. Here we are also facing some of the most obvious effects of climate change.
North has large petroleum resources, some of the world's richest fishing resources and untapped
mineral resources. When melting ice opens up new and shorter international shipping lanes,
awaits new challenges and opportunities in the area.
79

Norway to exercise its authority in the north in a credible, consistent and predictable manner. We must be at the forefront in
development and execution of sustainable management of the environment and natural resources in the area, and must be managed
resources as a basis for wealth creation, employment and settlement. Then we must be at the forefront
international efforts to develop knowledge for, about and in northern areas.
Labor will strengthen cooperation in the north with Russia and with our Nordic neighbors through
Barents cooperation, Arctic cooperation and North Calotte.
High North is a national initiative that will benefit the whole country great. It shall cooperate
with an active industrial policy and a proactive regional policy contribute to growth in the northern Norwegian region.
A policy to maintain the main features of the settlement pattern is important for strategic reasons, and
to exploit and develop natural resources in the area.
We will work easier border crossing, increased opportunities for labor migration and economic
and industrial cooperation zone in the north. Regional involvement, public participation and collaboration over
borders in the north will be an important part of the High North strategy. We will develop between peoples
cooperation of people-to-people through cultural, educational cooperation and collaboration on
business development. We will secure indigenous peoples' livelihoods, economic activity and culture in the area.
Labour will:
• Provide a consistent assertion of sovereignty in the Arctic, including through Coastguard
presence and aerial surveillance.
• Facilitate Norway to be at the forefront in the development of knowledge about the environment, resources and
economic development in the northern areas. A substantial part of this research and knowledge development
must take place at universities and colleges in the north.
• Strengthen transport connection between the northern and southern part of the country and across borders
eastward.
• Strengthen monitoring and warning system for the northern sea areas and preparedness against
pollution at sea. Cooperation with other Arctic coastal states about this must be strengthened.
• Facilitate new jobs in the north through the utilization of the natural advantages of
fishing activities, petroleum, wind power, mining and tourism.
• Develop the Norwegian-Russian cultural cooperation and collaboration from people-to-people in the Barents Region.
• Involve the relevant counties and the Sami Parliament in the design of the High North policy.
• Increase efforts for cooperation across borders that can focus also on social
programs, gender equality and human rights in the High North policy.
• Open for students who live near the border, you can take all or part of his schooling in
Finland.
• Include Asia in the strategic thinking around the northern areas.

Our relationship with Europe
Our closest partners we find in the Nordic countries. Nordic cooperation is based on
common values. Despite various alliance affiliation and forms of cooperation with Europe, the Nordic
cooperation has never been closer than now.
Europe is characterized by a deep crisis with serious economic and social consequences. It is not
possible unilaterally to save themselves out of such a crisis through cuts in public spending. Europe faces a
direction choice - a social policy where a focus on growth, investment, innovation and
modern welfare state makes it possible for anyone to contribute to society and realize their dreams, or
unilaterally cut policy that can lead to crisis worsens and that many risk falling permanently outside.
Our European neighbors is the main and largest export market for Norwegian goods and services.
It is in Norway's interest to contribute to the crisis to be overcome, as we have done through contributions to the IMF and
through the EEA Grants to reduce social inequalities in Europe and promoting economic growth
in recipient countries. EEA are Norway's most important international agreement and provide Norwegian industry
access to a large export market. It ensures that Norwegian companies can compete on equal terms, within
the same rules as competition in the internal market. EEA Agreement creates confidence
80

equal treatment, both for companies and individuals seeking employment or settling into our European
neighboring countries.
Cooperation with the EU through the EEA Agreement, the Schengen Agreement and a number of other agreements
implies that Norway is strongly integrated into European cooperation. Labor believes this is
important to safeguard Norwegian interests, economic and security policy.
Labor has not changed his view that EU membership would be an advantage for Norway. Simultaneously
Labor is a party where there is room for different views in the EU issue. We believe that Norway must have
agency to assess whether there will again be sought membership in the EU, based on a stable support in
people. Such questions shall be subject to the new congress treatment in labor. We believe that
any member application should be treated in the same way as before, and will respect the outcome of
a referendum.
Labour will:
• Lead an active European policy which safeguards Norwegian interests and contribute to achieving important goals
for Europe.
• Exploit leeway located in the EEA Agreement through early participation and implementation
compliance.
• Working for a common regulatory framework in the internal market that respects the principles and rights
that apply in our labor market.
• Strengthen cooperation with the EU in areas where we have common interests, such as climate, environment, research,
asylum and refugee policy.
• Strengthen cooperation with the European Parliament and the Council of Europe.
• Actively utilize our membership in the Party of European Socialists (PES) to promote our vision.
• Build up knowledge of EU cooperation and the EEA Agreement and to encourage an ongoing
Europe Debate.
• Develop cooperation in the Nordic countries further and to initiate joint Nordic efforts in international forums.
• Provide a good infrastructure cooperation between the Nordic countries.

Development policy - a question of creating and sharing
Economic development, power shifts, climate change, rapid population growth, pressure on
natural resources and large migration flows are changing the world and thus the frames for our
development policy. A number of countries in the South now has higher economic growth than we find in the northern
hemisphere. Economic growth has lifted several places large groups of people out of poverty. These changes
There is also a gender perspective and 70 percent of the world's most impoverished today are women. Simultaneously
has inequality increased within a number of these countries. Social unrest and demands for participation, social
rights and equitable distribution spreads in a number of countries. If they are successful not by creating employment
and good distribution policy the next few decades, the opportunities offered by a growing young and
employable population many places develop into social problems and political instability. Growth and
distribution must go hand in hand as a basis for sustainable development. We also know that assumptions
for such a development model is that we have strong organizations in cooperation with the state taking responsibility
for sustainable development. A country can not develop outside only through aid, it is the country of destination
who must sit in the seat. Long-term assistance can help provide country with a sensible policy
reducing poverty, appropriate incentives to continue.
Distribution and poverty reduction are closely linked with governance and democracy. Respect for
democratic rules, a free press, strong organizations and cooperation between the social
parties to facilitate a developmental model that manages to create and share simultaneously. Our international
efforts must increasingly be linked to good governance and demands for democracy in recipient countries.
Democratic rights, active citizens and strong organizations are the main pillars of democracy
and development. We want put more emphasis on party building and development of multi-party systems like important part of
democracy building.
Several developing countries have in the past 10-15 years have experienced significant economic growth, which in turn is
great importance to reduce poverty and provide the basis for a fair distribution. Access to
81

export markets is important for growth but also better access to national and regional markets.
Many countries in the South lack capital for private sector development, infrastructure, energy and expertise.
Confederation of respect for trade union rights and women's participation in the labor market is crucial for
sustainable development.
Although some former "developing countries" with high growth in recent years has managed to lift large groups
out of poverty, there are still a large number of poor again. The differences between the poorest and the rich
groups also increases. 70 percent of the world's poor now live in middle-income countries. Inequality
consequences for both social capital and conflicts, stability, growth and development. Unequal distribution of
resources also requires a global economy and policies that redistribute income.
Labour will:
• The Norwegian assistance will be at least 1 per cent of gross national income (GNI).
• The recipient responsibility should be prominent in our development policy.
• That our development policy clearly and consistently to promote democracy, human rights,
equality, fair distribution and job creation
• Contribute to strengthening the development and role of civil society, trade unions and free media
as pillars for the development of democracy.
• That Norway shall have a special focus on promoting the right to organize and in organized groups
opportunity to practice this right.
• That Norway promotes distribution policy and share our experiences with regard to redistribution,
gender equality and women's participation, tripartite cooperation, taxation, management of
natural resources and democracy building.
• Using GSP actively to give more countries duty and quota free market access for goods to Norway.
• The bilateral cooperation with countries in south promotes development, technology transfer and local
manufacturing.
• That we measure results of aid both on poverty reduction and reduced inequality.
• The national government is not forced to privatize or taxing public
welfare benefits.
• Continued push for debt restructuring and new forms of financing for development such
as FTT.
• The education and gender equality should be given priority in development aid.
• Contribute to ensure that all children are vaccinated and receive a basic healthcare.
• The Norwegian policy must be coherent, ie Norway ensures that Norwegian policy in various areas
mutually reinforcing and overall positive impact on opportunities for developing countries.
• Have a strong commitment to disaster prevention and climate adaptation.
• Actively promote the rights of disabled people, combating discrimination and work to provide
disabled children access to education.

Security and peace
Labor believes that the Norwegian peace and security is best assured through a predictable internationally
society founded on international law and human rights. This is both an expression of international
solidarity and the need for international regulation of relations between states. Norway will only
use military force in a manner that is consistent with international law. That means in self-defense or with
Based on a mandate of the UN Security Council. Our security policy should be anchored in international law.
Because of our large land and sea areas and our geographical location, we need nevertheless a strong
and modern defense system that can enforce Norwegian sovereignty and contribute to stability in our region.
Labor sees NATO as an anchor for Norwegian security policy within the overarching
framework of the UN. NATO membership has helped to make Norway's freedom and independence under
changing international conditions since we were co-founded the organization in 1949.
Nordic cooperation is increasingly important for Norwegian security. Challenges in the North as
climate change, crime, migration and resource reinforces the need for Nordic cooperation.
Also in the defense field, there is much to gain from increased cooperation between the Nordic countries' relatively
82

small defense. "Smart Defence" will for Norway in many cases be Nordic coordination.
Norden should therefore continue for more coordination, samøving and joint participation in international
peace operations.
Contributions to international peace and security through the United Nations and in other ways is important for a predictable
international community and to safeguard Norwegian peace and security. Few countries are more dependent on
global stability than small states with open economies such as Norway. Labour will work with
UN, EU, NATO and other civil and military efforts to promote human and state security.
Multinational peace support operations should be anchored in a clear and unequivocal UN mandate or
other recognized international legal basis if Norway will participate. Labor wants a close dialogue between
the Nordic countries and others about how best to support the UN's efforts to maintain
international peace and security. Labor will that participation in UN-led peacekeeping operations should
prioritized.
Labor wants Norway to play an active peace and reconciliation policy. We shall be jointly and severally
facilitator in the peace and reconciliation processes, but also be present civilian and military where it is
necessary. Peace processes are an end in themselves. It commits the parties and saves lives. It is
important that Norway cooperates closely with the United Nations in this area.
In war and conflict, we know that women are particularly vulnerable. Security Council resolution 1325 on women,
peace and security points both on women as victims of war, but also on women as key actors
for long-term peace. Labor will strengthen the practical implementation of the resolution and will
that women's rights are on the agenda in conflict and support NATO's efforts to strengthen
Security Council Resolution 1325.
Labor will contribute to disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction coming
higher up on the international agenda. Our goal is a world free of nuclear weapons and both
second mass destruction. We will work for security at the lowest possible levels of armaments through
binding international agreements. Labor will strengthen efforts in NATO to reduce nuclear weapons
role in security policy. We will work for the abolition of weapons that cause unacceptable
humanitarian suffering. Labor wants Norway to seek alliances with like-minded countries and with the
civil society in this process and take initiatives to get started new negotiation processes.
Every year losing too many lives around the world due to lack of control on the export and sale of
weapons. Labor wants strict international rules for the international arms trade.
Labor wants conventional weapons that cause unacceptable humanitarian consequences withdrawn
of use.
Labour will:
• Strengthening NATO-Russia cooperation and preserve the political dialogue with Russia.
• Working for a further deepening of Nordic cooperation.
• Working actively for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and four consecutive
sikkerhetsresolusjonene 1820, 1888, 1889, 1960.
• Work against sexual violence and the use of rape in war.
• Working for a world free of nuclear weapons through mutually binding disarmament.
• That Norway will seek a new impetus in international disarmament efforts, including rules requiring
greater emphasis on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons.

• Working towards the storage of new nuclear weapons in Europe.
• That Norway maintains and develops strict regulations for Norwegian arms exports.
• Work actively to promote respect for humanitarian principles and humanitarian access in
conflict situations.
• Work to strengthen the protection of civilians affected by armed conflict, including health professionals and
health systems.
• Labor aims to introduce end-user certificates from all countries, and work to ensure that this becomes
norm in NATO.

83

Defense
Armed basic function is to protect and safeguard our security, interests and
values. Armed Forces shall exercise Norwegian authority and help to prevent and manage incidents and
security crises. An important task for the military must also be contributing to multinational
crisis management and to work for international peace and security. In particular, the defense being able to
To solve the challenges Norway might face in the North. Armed Forces will be present
in northern areas with relevant contributions from all branches of the military, including the Coast Guard that plays a
important role as the state authority enforces in our waters.
Norway exposed to daily threats in the digital space. There is a security policy challenge in a society
who increasingly are adopting and becomes dependent on technology. Norway must strengthen efforts
digital security as it stands in relation to the threat.
Armed Forces will also help to safeguard social security through assistance to civil society
in peacetime. We also made sure to maintain a decentralized Home Guard covering the whole country.
Labor will continue to ensure that the Armed Forces have a balance between economy, structure and tasks.
Labor is concerned that the Armed Forces should be integral part of Norwegian society. We are a
defense based on universal military service and believes that the facility on Compulsory military service
must be developed to be best adapted to the Armed Forces, society and the individual conscripts
needs. For Labor is people in the military important, and we want to ensure favorable conditions
and recognition of the staff of the Armed Forces. The aim is that the defense sector can better manage, attract
and develop the important military and civilian expertise of its employees. Labor will follow up
and prioritize the overall efforts to strengthen the community's recognition and safeguarding of our
veterans.
Armed Forces must reflect the same diversity that characterizes the rest of society, whether it concerns
ethnic background, gender equality or age range. Increased diversity provides new competencies
and broader experience, which will make the defense better equipped to meet the challenges both outside and
home.
Labour will:
• Follow up long-term plan for the Armed Forces 2013-2016 and ensure sound financial management in
Defense and a long-term balance between defense tasks, structure and economy.
• Conduct a competence reform in the Armed Forces. The defense will focus on employees and their
expertise, and work actively to recruit, retain and develop qualified personnel.
Officers system (including the system of arrangements for enlisted personnel and civilians) shall consider and adapt
modern mission defense.
• Develop armed services of the Armed Forces so that Norway always has a modern Air Force,
Navy, a modern Army and a decentralized Home Guard which is able to meet our
security challenges.
• Ensure safe communication in the armed forces through a further development of Cyber ​​Force.
• Have a good interaction between the armed forces and the civil sector and ensure that the armed forces are active
contributor to the civilian part of civil protection.
• Develop the defense sector's overall efforts against threats from the digital space.
• Increase the percentage of women in the Armed Forces.
• Go for gender-neutral conscription.
• Review tax exemption and duty basis when conscription changed.
• Strengthening family policy in the Armed Forces.
• Continued emphasis on the rights of veterans including health and social support, economic

and focus on our region in NATO.

84

• Develop and strengthen the Nordic cooperation through material procurement,
participation in international operations, education, monitoring, crisis management and
Arctic issues.

Refugees and asylum policy
Perhaps the biggest demographic social change we have experienced in our time is a result of
international migration - that people are fleeing or wandering. More people are living in a country other than
where they are born. Labor believes that immigration is fundamentally positive. That more and more looking at
Norway as a land of opportunity and want to settle here, is something we can be proud of. But Norway
can not accept everyone who wants to settle here. Labour will pursue an integrated and consistent
immigration policy. We will pursue a humane, fair and consistent asylum and immigration policies, based on
international agreements that Norway has undertaken to follow.
The immigration administration should be transparent and predictable. It is a measure of Labor to have a
easy to use and efficient management with quick processing. Those who come to Norway, has a
responsibility to document their own identity and submit the necessary papers.
Norway has a moral responsibility to receive people fleeing war and persecution. Those who have
need protection because they have been forced to leave their homeland, to get the protection they
due in Norway. Our policies should be based on human rights and refugee convention.
Recommendations of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees will be an important basis for our policy.
Labor will work for measures targeting trafficking victims. Criminal acts related
this should be discovered and punished, but we also need good preventive measures. We must protect and
