SOCIAL SECURITY
A caring society for
Shared Prosperity
Status and political horizon
Current situation: the challenges of social protection
Since the end of World War II, efficient social protection systems have
been developed in Belgium, particularly as part of social security. These conquests
important social helped successfully respond to many social challenges and
significantly improve the protection of citizens from various life risks (illness,
unemployment, old age, disability ...).
Depending on the context and emerging needs, our welfare system has already been
adjusted several times. In addition to defending social conquests of certain particularly
important, the major challenge for social security is to continue meeting so
performing the various challenges of today and tomorrow to continue to play its role
shock absorber in the economic crisis that Europe is experiencing.
However, in Belgium and in most EU countries, social protection systems are
face various challenges. These challenges, related mostly have largely been accentuated by the crises
we know.
Persistence and rising social inequality
The Belgians are collectively among the richest in the world. Overall, the heritage
Belgians continues to grow. The net worth of all Belgians in 2013 thus amounted to
1916 billion € or 60% more than in 2002 and 16% more than in 2007 (before the crisis).
This represents an average of € 401,600 per household.
However, if the average value of the Belgian household wealth grows, inequality in
distribution of wealth and economic insecurity on the one hand more and more important
of the population are also growing.
This growing inequality obviously affects primarily benefit recipients
(pensioners, unemployed, disabled ...). Live well below the poverty threshold of 37.8%
unemployed, 22.8% and 20.2% of disabled pensioners, the majority of
women. The low allocations and lack of connection to the welfare of the latter explained
widely this reality and its worsening over the years.
Moreover, although it is correct that the fact of having a job is the best defense
against precarity, workers are also affected by the growth of inequality. Of
workers, increasingly numerous, are being forced to actually be in precarious jobs
accompanied by inadequate compensation and, moreover, less and less perfectly related
price trends. Fermatas this growth in inequality among workers
the emergence of "working poor", that is to say, workers living with revenues
below the poverty level (4.2% in Belgium) and the increase in those who have
hold two professional occupations to get by financially.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter SOCIAL SECURITY - p 1/17

Creating jobs quality.1
Most EU countries are also faced with the persistence of mass unemployment. The area
euro account, since February 2013, over 20 million unemployed. They are more than 9 million
2008 and five million more than in 2010; this demonstrates, in passing, ineffective policies
austerity judging them in terms of job creation. There are 200 000-300 of 000 unemployed
more each month in the euro area.
In Belgium, according to the Federal Planning Bureau, more than 660,000 workers are unemployed in
2013. The Federal Planning Bureau estimates that this figure could rise to nearly 700,000 in 2015.
The situation is of particular concern for young people. There are more than 170 000 less
30 years not to have job Belgium2.
Many workers must also accept precarious jobs: jobs (very)
short, unworthy working conditions, low pay, and little or incessant courses
... The unpaid part-time work, mostly assumed by women, has,
example, experienced a meteoric rise in recent years it has now reached almost
30% of total employment. Similarly, the use of fixed-term contracts (12% of
contracts) and temporary contracts is becoming more common. The number of temporary workers has
increased very significantly since the early 80s. 7450 Interim
FTEs were put to work per day in 1983, while they are currently more
of 81,000 (and this despite the significant decline occurred in 2008 following the crisis
economic). In Belgium, the share of temporary employment in total employment is more
important in the UK (7.6% against 5%).
This increased job insecurity is reflected in the increased number of accidents
work (a person dies 2 of 3 working days in a work accident in Belgium)
by higher INAMI beneficiaries of compensation. The number of recipients of allowances
INAMI for primary disability (incapacity recognized during the first year) and
disability (inability to work recognized beyond the first year) has increased by nearly 40%
since 2008. In total, in 2013, 139 million days have been compensated.
For most Member States of the euro area, the question of the creation of quality jobs,
especially for young people, is another challenge.
The elongation of the duration of the life3
The average life expectancy increased by 24 years in the twentieth century and continues to grow: we
win now, Belgium, a quarter every year in life expectancy! Belgium
has therefore more than 2 million pensioners and pensioners, about a fifth of
his population.
For various reasons, including the arrival at the pension children of the baby boom and a declining birth rate
the lengthening of life, this proportion will only increase over the next
years. Today, 1.9 million people over 65 in Belgium (17.6% of the
population). In 2030, 2.7 million will be in the same situation (22.6% of the population). The
dependency ratio, that is to say the ratio of people aged 65 and over and
people of working age between 15 and 64 years, gradually from 26.8% today to 37.3%
in 2060.
This lengthening of life resulting in a series of major challenges: how to better
include seniors in our society, how to ensure seniors have sufficient resources to

live with dignity, how to ensure fiscal sustainability of this increase in the duration of
life4?
Career development and modes of life5
The twenty-first century, no one can automatically talk about insecurity, workers
are usually occupied from 20 to 65 years with the same employer. The quarries are
less linear: Workers often change employers, work places,
status …. In the same career, it is not uncommon for workers to be alternately
independent, employee, official, when they do not simply combine several statutes
at the same time.
Furthermore, workers adapt and adjust more often wish their working time by
choice or obligation, so take care of their families, to train, to blow,
because they lost their jobs, because they are sick ...
The continued employment of workers in satisfactory condition until the end of their
career becomes dependent upon the company's ability to offer the course workers
allow them to preserve their health, develop their skills, maintain their
commitment to work and reconciling private and professional life.
Adequate funding for social protection systems
Belgium spent 30.7% of its GDP on social expenditures. These expenses have increased since
the beginning of the crisis, as GDP is lower and social expenditures increase. With
lengthening the life span, the share of social spending will increase.
In a European context marked by austerity choices and sluggish growth, the
numbers make some people say that social spending should be reduced significantly
and linear. That the same does not say is that the austerity measures and cuts
dark in social spending threaten current and future jobs, welfare
citizens and therefore the future prosperity of our societies. What they do not say is that a
relatively low level of public social expenditure can induce private social spending
additional - called "voluntary" - which generates access to health inequalities,
old age protection, etc. Thus the United States in 2009, the share of private social spending
Volunteers, including for example subscribe to a private mutual health or a
supplementary pension, was the highest of the 34 OECD countries with 10.2%. Secondly
position were the Netherlands (6%). Finally, those that deny it is the stabilizing role
social security in times of crisis: ensuring decent income to a maximum of
citizens, regardless of their employment status, health or age, it prevents
phenomena of poverty, which would cause disorder and major public costs and
it provides some stability in domestic consumption, the relevant income being
assigned to primary needs: food, heating, clothing, travel ... rather than being
hoarded.
Extending social protection in globalization
National social protection systems are influenced by the international environment, and
particularly by the constant movement of workers and companies.
In the absence of common rules aimed at harmonizing social rights, the risk of dumping
social increases. New plant closures and production sites in our country, to the benefit
entities not applying the same rules of social or environmental protection, we have
recalled in recent months and recent years. Despite the quality of the workforce and
products designed in our country, our economy suffers - as is also the case in

According to the latest annual report of the Study Committee on Aging, the weight of all social spending
increase by 5.4% of GDP over the period 2012-2060.

other European countries - of free trade that is anything but fair and that became
Today free trade pollution and worker exploitation. Competition
World is based less and less on the quality of goods offered in markets
international, while prices do not reflect all costs generated during their
production and global competition is not based on ambitious standards of respect
of the environment. We therefore find that one of the principles that some have wanted to center
the European project and the single market, namely that of "free and undistorted competition", is
clearly the order of myth.

Social security pressurizing
In Belgium, social security forms the heart of our social safety nets. A part
important answers to the challenges mentioned above therefore requires the redeployment of this
last.
Currently, however, that social security is under pressure from all sides: by the forces
separatists, by those who use the budget context to estimate that the state is too
generous and that this solidarity would be too expensive, for those who say they want to save the essential
but endorsed major social regression and do not think about tomorrow, for the forces
market (especially in terms of pensions and health care) who only dream of
privatization and thus to benefit from the "bonanza" of citizen contributions while
selecting strictly the "risks" to cover.
Contrary to what some are trying to convince the social regression occurred over
last years6 are not at all a necessary social evil for a better
future economic. The current social catastrophe is also at the same time a disaster
economic. The recession indeed prevents the crisis countries to deleverage, both side
private actors as that of the States, it slows domestic consumption, while the
mass unemployment, by persisting, becoming more structural, complicating everything
future redeployment of the economy.
If we continue in this direction and we are not careful, the social security system gradually lose its effectiveness,
its credibility and legitimacy. It will be endangered by its inability to meet the challenges
mentioned above.

The political horizon Ecolo on social security
For Ecolo, each and everyone should be able to choose a future and have the ability to bounce back if
it is necessary, regardless of age, origin, gender, sexual orientation,
handicap ... Everyone must have the opportunity to train, develop a profession or
to undertake. No one can remain beside the road. The state and the community are an
rampart social fragility of everyone and especially children, persons undergoing
precarious situation, with disabilities, elderly or injured for life. The role of the state and
the community is also to prevent and remedy the précarité7.
Although recessions are not conducive to social mobilizations and they
could incite everyone for himself, Ecolo calls for a strengthening of solidarity,
through social safety nets and, primarily, through the very best
in this area in Belgium since the end of World War II: social security. Ecolo
therefore proposes to strengthen and reshape into dialogue with the social partners to
respond appropriately to the different challenges of today and tomorrow, including

the lengthening of life, deep changing careers, the challenge of financing
adequate and the fight against inequality (the latter demanding challenge course, beyond a
strengthening social protection, tax reform).
Moreover, the institutional context in Belgium led to the transfer to the entities
Federated several policies previously managed at the federal social security.
For Ecolo, it is essential that policies deployed at the federated entities in the
extension of this transfer to be effective and meet the same requirements of solidarity and
public service, in conjunction with the social partners.
Given the increasing internationalization of our societies, Ecolo is also favorable, insofar
possible, the gradual development of social protection measures at European level,
to harmonize upwards social norms and expand solidarity.
Finally, Ecolo wishes to encourage all forms of social innovation, helping to increase
solidarity. In associations or trade unions in the social economy, SMEs or
big business, with our families and in our neighborhoods, we live everyday experience
solidarity. Ecolo encourages any initiative that reinvents the social links and exchanges
daily by the friendliness, the "gift against gift" and cooperation. Ecolo particularly supports
multiple associative commitments as they also constitute a remedy to social insecurity.
This chapter outlines the general and cross-cutting proposals to strengthen and reshape
Social security and social safety nets. The thematic chapters of the book
"For Social Justice", and the chapter "Europe" program continues on the Ecolo
this way by presenting more specific answers to the regarded themes.

The Ecolo force lines
For Ecolo, strong social security, whose meshes are tightened and that ensures solidarity and
the emancipation of individuals, through the implementation of the following priorities:
Reaffirm the mission and principles such as insurance, empowerment, solidarity and
social cohesion, a strong federal social security
Ensure adequate funding for social security and protection devices
social
Ensuring the dignity of working men and women by transverse measures
Give shape to a social Europe, including through upward harmonization of
social norms
Developing social protection at the federal entities, additionally to
strong federal social security
Foster social innovation to strengthen and modernize solidarity

Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: REAFFIRMING THE MISSIONS AND PRINCIPLES OF SAFETY
FEDERAL SOCIAL FORTE
Ecolo hear clearly reaffirm what constitutes for him the social security missions.
Environmentalists indeed four missions assigned to social security: Insurance, emancipation,
solidarity and social cohesion.
Insurance so that workers who have paid can benefit from
sufficient coverage and can overcome the vagaries of life (illness, old age,

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter SOCIAL SECURITY - p 5/17

unemployment …). In this regard, we are witnessing an erosion of insurance-covers
our system. The replacement rate for many keeps on minimum benefits
decline since the 80's, for lack of a real connection to wellness. This is true
for the amount of pensions, the amount of disability benefits or that of
chômage8 benefits. Other decisions, such as increased degression allowances
unemployment, unemployed or hunting the recent pension reform also
weakened the insurance-social security;
Emancipation, that social security is a springboard for
citizens. For Ecolo, social security, much more than a minimal safety net for
mesh larger and larger, must remain a springboard that allows citizens
and citizens to emancipate, to start or to restart, regardless of the time of
life. For Ecolo, this is to ensure the dignity of persons, including when they are
difficulty or recipients of aid, and give them a role of actors of change;
Solidarity and social cohesion, to better distribute wealth and to
contribute to the fight against social dropout and marginalization that threatens our
companies. People are more accomplished in a more egalitarian society. Various
Wilkinson and Pickett9 which researchers have shown that in a more egalitarian society,
various community dependent costs were lower, the costs of
health policies and costs of corrections socio-economic imbalances
responsible for social security.
Moreover, by organizing a redistribution of wealth, social security helps
economic activity, since its beneficiaries are also consumers and
consumers.
As part of these four missions, social security is fundamentally ecological, that is to say,
it applies to the issue of solidarity the principles of sustainable development, to prevent rather
than cure, ensure access of future generations to these solidarity mechanisms, think long
term and prevent the consequences of the choices.
Beyond the four missions of social security (insurance, solidarity, cohesion and empowerment
social), Ecolo intends to reaffirm the following principles:
the social security system is, and must remain, a public utility system; his
building must fit into this framework and not grow through the
privatization of certain sectors;
the historical principle of joint management of social security between
social partners should be strengthen; our proposals on
Social Security refinancing are tools that will avoid putting
social partners systematically demand position vis-à-vis and dependence on a government majority;
Social Security must remain in federal funding and its
hedging mechanisms; environmentalists remain committed to a design
interpersonal solidarity and not an inter design; only
Interpersonal design, because it frees allegiance systems of any kind,
lets out for assistance or charity concepts; it is also especially
effective as it is built on a broad basis;
the management of social security budgets must remain global; if bonuses
Structural had to emerge in certain sectors, they might be, if any,
assigned to others, including to cover new needs, for example relating to
the increase in life span. It seems possible to shift spending
8
This is a fortiori the case even for job seekers who do not find employment quickly enough,
which are purely and simply denied the benefit of the insurance-coverage against unemployment, with
the introduction of the increased degression of unemployment benefits.

especially useful in view of social and demographic changes that we
know.

PRIORITY 2: ENSURE ADEQUATE FINANCING AND SOCIAL SECURITY
OF SOCIAL PROTECTION DEVICES
To meet the financial challenges of the different challenges presented above, Ecolo offers
different levers to operate, either improved revenue contribution of capital,
including speculative, financing of the State and solidarity, the rate increase
employment, the fight against tax fraud, better governance at all levels of power
or control of certain expenses.

Proposal: Increase the rate of emploi10
When more people are working, and for a longer period, they pay more
social contributions and the budgetary cost of aging is reduced. This, the traditional parties
already been saying for years.
However, as said before, at the same time unemployment is historically high,
job quality is deteriorating and the possibilities to reconcile private and professional life,
when they have not simply been planed, are not always adapted to the
situation of women workers and workers. Account must be taken of the fact that, in absolute terms, there is
currently not enough jobs for all the people available and workers
are not always able to work longer.
For Ecolo, adequate funding of social security is through the increased rate
Job. Ecolo offers several ways to create quality jobs: Investing in
transition to a sustainable economy, developing innovative devices for time-sharing
work (as, for example, the Tandem plan - see "Seniors and Pensions"), slide
taxation from labor to taxation of capital and improve the quality of jobs throughout the
career, including by supporting career development. In this connection, the issue of
"Work longer" will find an adequate response if the question of "working
otherwise "is posed and treated simultaneously.

Proposal: To control spending on social security
The introduction of a rebalanced social contribution as we imagine and rising rates
Job will ensure sustainable revenues and social security will revitalize celleci. In addition, a reorientation of certain social policies can improve the welfare of
citizens, while generating some savings.
In care of health11 example, high costs can be avoided if the downstream
primary care medicine is adjusted and made more accessible to everyone and if,
collaboration with federal entities, health prevention is developed. It must
particular contribute to a reduction of unnecessary care or drug consumption,
such as psychotropic.
Similarly, it is essential to continue funding forfaitarisation hospitals and
to seriously engage in the structuring care areas to get out of the logic of
sterile competition is a source of duplication and unnecessary expenses.

The chapters "Employment and Vocational Training" and "Seniors and Pensions" of 2014 return program in detail
Ecolo on the proposals on the matter.
11
For more information about the proposals Ecolo health, see Chapter "Health".

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter SOCIAL SECURITY - p 7/17

In addition, by improving the quality of employment, the costs of occupational diseases,
accidents, labor disabilities or drug treatments would be reduced,
potentially significantly. Thus, various costs to social security charge
decrease.
Finally, most policies aimed at empowering people and improving our
environment are also likely to reduce the addition of social spending. The practice of
physical activity or social ties contribute to the welfare of the population. Similarly, the quality of
air, water, food are all factors that influence health, and thus costs are
afférant. In this regard, it is clear that social and environmental justices go together.
The most insecure citizens generally live in a poorer environment
quality.
Ecolo intends to ensure rigorous management of budgets for solidarity and work towards
improved governance in this area. Conversely, Ecolo fiercely opposed to measures
which, under cover of economies, have the effect of transferring the burden of a budget to another.
Among these false economies include in particular the unemployed exclusion policy,
degression policy of unemployment benefits and the policy to limit the internship
insertion, which have the effect of increasing the number of aid recipients of the CPAS
including the number of beneficiaries of the integration income. Similarly, the policy of
harden access to reductions in working hours at retirement results in
increase industrial accidents, occupational diseases and the number of people
inability travail12.

Proposal: Make contribute more capital income for solidarity
In Belgium, social security is the heart of social protection. It should therefore be the
adequately fund.
Currently, social security is mainly financed through payroll taxes levied
on the work: they always provide two thirds of its revenue. The transfer of tax revenues
operated by the alternative financing (VAT revenue, in particular) is complementary. The third
social security financing source comes from the federal state grants. Among these
grants is "a social security balance staffing" whose amount is fixed
every year and aims to ensure the financial equilibrium of social security. In 2013,
this equilibrium allocation amounted to 5.3 billion €. Given the lack of other sources of
financing, this equilibrium allocation is more important each year.13.
However, this funding does not allow to cope with the social changes and
Demographic and give the breath needed to develop new initiatives. he
may instead be the subject of haggling unhealthy or even dangerous for the structural balance
public finance. But the twenty-first century can not be reduced to a simple defense of the achievements of
past or a decrease of solidarity.
For Ecolo, the financing of social security must be seen more broadly to
consolidate the foundation of social security. It is in this context that for years, Ecolo
proposes to contribute more capital income to finance solidarity in the
social security framework rebalanced through a payroll tax. The universal access
the coverage available and the willingness to further develop them should indeed be
accompanied by a change in the structure of contributory social security levies.
12

These measures were adopted by the outgoing Federal majority (2011-2014).
The establishment of alternative financing and later of the social security balance staffing was made
required by several developments since the birth of social security at the end of the second war
World. Expenditures have followed an upward trend: universal access to solidarity, lengthening
lifestyle, become structural unemployment, increased spending on health care (over-consumption, technological development ...).
The recipes, they are under pressure from the economic crisis and the heavy competitive environment of an economy
globalized free market and with a significant level of inactivity, social security often becoming Furthermore, a
instrument of some employment policy through the provision of massive cuts in social contributions.
13

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter SOCIAL SECURITY - p 8/17

We need to change the financing of social protection to make it more diverse and more
equitable and to ensure that its spontaneous evolution is at least as fast as the
GDP.
Ecolo therefore proposes to reduce the tax burden on labor, especially unskilled labor,
removing socially unjust contributions and replacing them by a fee
Social rebalanced (CSR). Except for the lowest income that are exempt from this
contribution, this rebalancing would target all income, including capital. Hold back
a broad base allows for lower tax rates while preserving the volume
recipes. Furthermore, introducing an exemption to the base, is provide some progressiveness
the levy, while avoiding excessive it is in a system where the redistribution is done
more by services than by withdrawal. Submit an allowance is
Also avoid opening the debate about the nature exemptions (which primarily benefit them most
high income) while reducing "poverty traps", since low incomes, regardless
their source (wages or replacement allowance) would be treated similarly.
The main reason for the establishment of CSR is to change the philosophy of
financing social protection: the CSR aims to be the instrument of a fair funding
and sustainable social protection that responds to changes in coverage, while transferring
part of taxation from labor to taxation of capital, which can only encourage
dynamic and effective employment policy.
In May 2011, the National Bank of Belgium and the Federal Planning Bureau analyzed the effects
a reduction in employer contributions and personal contributions to social security,
offset by increases of other levies. These institutions have tested several
scenarios and it turns out that the establishment of a general social contribution (ie a measure that
strongly approach to CSR proposal defended by Ecolo) is the best modality
Alternative funding, both from a budgetary point of view for competitiveness and employment.
According to the National Bank of Belgium and the Federal Planning Bureau, this modality is indeed
likely to create over 35 000 jobs to a 7-year horizon.

Proposal: To fight against social fraud
The creation of more jobs and better jobs must be one of the main
social policy objectives of the Belgian State. In this regard, it is essential that workers
can evolve in a safe and healthy work environment.
However, as tax fraud, social security fraud, in all its forms, imperils our
social model leads to precarious working conditions (absence of minimum wage,
days off, supervision of work hours) to a casualization of workers (lack
protection against dismissal, guaranteed salary in case of illness or job loss) and
false balances on the labor market.
The risks associated with social fraud are detrimental both for the worker and
the employer and, in this context, to avoid is an imperative of social justice and efficiency
economic. This should not, however, constitute a pretext for certain stigma
workers: this is a priority target fraud schemes and those who organize it.
In this context, Ecolo believes that the fight against the abuse of posting of workers
must be a priority. More and more cases of unfair competition and exploitation
workers, particularly in the sectors of construction, transport or cleaning, saw
developed in recent years. It is particularly suitable to fight, including
equipping staff inspection services sufficient tools in this area.
Furthermore, in order to fight effectively against social fraud, particularly certain sectors
exposed to this phenomenon must be supervised and supported. It is essential that the arsenal
of measures to curb fraud is correlated with support measures which take
account the specificity of these fragile economic sectors on the market. Indeed,

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter SOCIAL SECURITY - p 9/17

mechanisms against fraud which does not reflect the market reality
employment, are often ineffective to eradicate social fraud mechanisms.

PRIORITY 3: SECURING THE DIGNITY OF PERSONS BY MEASURES
CROSS
Each field of social protection (employment, health, seniors, fight against poverty ...) faces
specific issues. The following chapters of the book present the Social Justice proposals
Ecolo detailed in this regard. However, beyond these specific responses, there are
overarching principles that should guide on social protection policies. This is
somehow the extension qu'Ecolo missions assigned to social security.

Proposal: To guarantee a decent income
Ecolo want to allow each one to live with a decent income. To do this, the
through different parts of the program, including Ecolo proposes to upgrade the salary
minimum, and sociales15 pensions14 allocations, to preserve the indexing mechanism
salaries and social benefits that can link this income to changes in the cost of living (in
less perfectly unfortunately) and, finally, to establish a real connection to social welfare benefits.

Proposal: Individualize social rights
Ecolo proposes deepening individualization of social rights. It is thus taken into account
changes to families, to eliminate the current discrimination based on marital status or
cohabitation and allow every adult to benefit from specific rights,
irrespective of its private links with another adult. Indeed, while one
collects contributions individually, it does not hold true for the granting of benefits,
where the notion of households prevails in the event of unemployment, disability allowance and
including pensions. Ideally, this is done at the expense of the principle of equality and to
Concretely, most often to the disadvantage of women. This also leads, in certain
situations, to costly and devastating bypass strategies for social relationship (
eg by creating fictitious addresses or through "sleep merchants").
Specifically, Ecolo proposes the establishment of transitional arrangements allowing for
acquired situations, individualisation of rights by landing and by age cohort, with
first stage the abolition of the category "cohabiting" in benefit schemes of
unemployment, disability benefits and a general alignment of benefits and rights on the current
"isolated" category.

Proposal: Combating unemployment traps to avoid effects or cleavers
threshold effects and facilitate the transition to employment
A trap for use is any situation where the incentive for the job seeker to search or
accept employment is insufficient or nonexistent. We speak of a threshold effect when an increase
salary ultimately causes a decrease in disposable income.
Ecolo wants to fight against these intolerable situations and increase the difference between the salary and
replacement income. To this end, Ecolo offers, among other things, a salary recovery

For more information, see Chapter "Seniors and Pensions".
Ecolo proposes increasing allocations above the poverty line set at 60% of median income.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter SOCIAL SECURITY - p 10/17

minimum relief parafiscal pressure on labor through the introduction of a levy
Social rebalanced, the reduction in the tax burden on labor and revaluation
the income guarantee allowance in order to make work pay unemployment at
the recovery of a part-time job.

Proposal: To ensure non-discrimination and greater equality in
social rights octroyés16
Ecolo wants to end certain privileges granted through several special procedures:
Pension officials, governors ...
Ecolo also like to fight against different social rights which are not justified or more
totally, going to a minimum pension equal for example, that workers have
made a career as an employee, as a freelancer or a mixed career.
Generally, Ecolo wishes to end discrimination including gender, to
age and ethnicity that exist among others in the labor market.

Proposal: Improve access to social safety nets, the
transparency of these arrangements and the involvement of stakeholders in the
design, implementation and monitoring of policies
Ecolo wants to improve access to a greater number of people to social benefits
which they may be eligible: guaranteed income for older people ... Omnio status,
automating procedures octroi17.
Ecolo also calls for greater transparency of the devices. For example, the
recent reform of degression of unemployment benefits or pensions goes against
this, nobody (not even the relevant public services) that can meet the
legitimate questions that citizens ask for lack of clarity on the part of decisions
government. In doing so, these reforms significantly contravene the principle of the Charter of
the insured person. In terms of transparency, Ecolo also wants citizens to
easily know what rights they have formed on pensions.
Finally, Ecolo considers relevant, whenever possible and useful, to involve citizens and
citizens in political set up, to inform them, to allow them to understand
issues, ask their opinion, to reflect and enhance their contributions devices
put in place.

PRIORITY 4: GIVE BODY SOCIAL EUROPE
The general objectives of the European Treaties put the values ​​and principles of solidarity, of
social and territorial cohesion and high levels of social protection at the heart of the device
European. Yet the European Union is often - and rightly - pointed out as
being a vector of social insecurity. Too many recommendations of the Commission
European, endorsed by the Council - that is to say by the Member States, such as pressure
constant for the deregulation of the labor market (including the questioning
systematic automatic wage indexation) and the reduction of social spending
thus tend to undermine social rights are particularly important, especially for
more fragile.

For more on this, see Chapters "Seniors and Pensions" and "fight against poverty".
Ecolo also proposes the creation of a rights Explorer, see about Chapter "Fight against poverty".

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter SOCIAL SECURITY - p 11/17

Furthermore, more and more workers are facing unfair competition between social
workers from 27 countries, commonly called "social dumping". Indeed,
Many companies located within the European Union abusing free rules
circulation, including through the posting of workers from one country to another, to
around and degrade social law which applies.
In this way, some companies are heading to the systematic recruitment of workers
less protection, social and wage levels in order to increase their profit margins and
to thwart workers' representation.
This inevitably leads to unfair competition vis-à-vis other
entrepreneurs who are denied market but also to unacceptable competition
EU workers to a leveling down of workers' protection
and jobs where the conditions of minimum working and employment are often not respected.
It is necessary to urgently address the fight against social dumping phenomenon that the precarious
labor market and discredits the European project. In the eyes of environmentalists, the social dimension
must be placed at the heart of the European project that has so far been marked by excessively
priority given to the economy and especially the deregulated finance. In social matters as
tax matters, Europe must move from a logic of competition to the logic of cooperation and
harmonization upwards. In this perspective, the European Union has several
levers to change the situation and to eradicate this phenomenon. Ecolo considers it essential that these
tools are mobilized.

Proposal: Line up the social norms
Firstly, environmentalists wish implementation of convergence procedures between
Member countries of the European Union on the basis of common indicators, to align
"Upwards" of social norms.
In this context, to promote social protection at European level and to fight
social dumping, a series of regulation and control instruments should be set up:
the upward revision of the common floors standards in the field of political
social, particularly in terms of working hours, maternity-paternity leave,
work conditions. Ecolo offers futures adoption of a guaranteed minimum income above the Member States poverty line of at least 60% of median income
national (or € 1000 / month for a single person in Belgium in 2010), in order to achieve
all the effective implementation of the rights enshrined in the Charter of Rights
Fundamentals, the European Social Charter or the UN conventions on human rights
civil, social and economic;
the realization of a short-term goal of halving poverty by
202018, with special attention to child poverty, the ultimate goal
eradication of poverty;
strengthening the fight against direct and indirect discrimination which start
wrong gender equality in terms of access to work, conditions of work, access
the various functions and salary;
the improvement of the directive on the posting of workers so as to remove
montages of unfair competition, and broadening its legal basis in politics
employment (and not just the freedom to provide services);
the establishment of a broader coordination between social inspection services
each Member State and a strengthening of field controls.

18

Belgium has committed to reducing from 380 000 units the number of people at risk of poverty and
social exclusion by 2020 (compared to reference year 2008: 2 194 000 persons).

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter SOCIAL SECURITY - p 12/17

Beyond the fight against fiscal dumping, this harmonization process must allow
improved labor mobility, in that it would make the rights to social security more
comparable and easily portable from one country to another. In the longer term, it must allow the
common to the European social level security elements, translating into reality an
true solidarity of all Europeans. Finally, the upward harmonization of standards
Social must also apply within each Member State concerned, each of its
residents, whatever their nationality.

Proposal: Include the social dimension in economic governance
EU
While the need for closer integration of economic policies at European level is
evident to environmentalists, it is not conceivable to proceed on the basis of a
exclusively fiscal discipline, accelerating de facto leveling down of protection
social.
In this perspective, the common governance processes must be expanded by including
Social quantitative criteria such as the reduction of poverty and inequality. These criteria (as well
that environmental criteria) must be placed on an equal footing with the criteria
budget. A future revision of the EU treaties must give them binding force.

Proposal: Strengthen the European Social Dialogue
The European social partners must become leading players in the
building a more social Europe. The development of European collective agreements

more than necessary today. Political actors should support such initiatives, especially
more in a context where the accession of new members into the Union increases
the heterogeneity of collective bargaining practices and their level of achievement. To
to avoid a race to the bottom, it should actively support the new member states,
aiming the strengthening of the social actors and the possibilities of collective bargaining.

Proposal: Establish social and environmental duties for
borders of the Union
To protect our economy and protect our workers effects of a global market
deregulated and in accordance with the possibilities opened by the rules of the World Organization of
(WTO) and European Union (EU), Ecolo proposes the introduction of customs duties
social and environmental at European level in respect of goods and services produced in
problematic social and environmental conditions in emerging countries. This is
a powerful tool that the EU can and should use to contribute to high
social and environmental standards in those countries and make them comparable to
that the EU is necessary. Beyond that, it's an interesting track for the crisis, the
relocation of the economy and reducing transportation requirements and CO2 emissions.
The introduction of such social and environmental duties would constitute an obvious capital gain on the grounds of both economic, social and environmental ... in reverse
austerity policies of the Member States whose economic and social effects
dramatic.
Specifically, basic social standards (such as freedom of association, recognition
the effective right to collective bargaining, prohibition of forced labor or children, equality
female-male wage, etc.) of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and standards
Environmental arising from the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development held in Rio de Janeiro from 3 to 14 June, 1992, the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 and
the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in 1992, should be much

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter SOCIAL SECURITY - p 13/17

useful references to regulate trade with countries outside Europe and especially
incentives for them to improve the well-being of their population. Thus, through the device
proposed, these standards will be as many motivations for countries in trade relations
with the EU to improve their social and environmental performance and their reward
efforts in this area.
Conversely, this device penalize countries that derive part of their competitive advantage in the
Non-compliance with such social or environmental standards or an aggressive policy rate
exchange as their currency is kept artificially low. Tax revenues
seen by the EU as a levy these tariffs will
mainly allocated to the strengthening of solidarity with the South and the fight against
climate change. They will contribute to both meet these critical objectives and
redeployment of the European economy.
In no event it does is create a blind protectionism. The aim is to fight
against social and environmental dumping which, while detrimental to the competitiveness of our
companies, violates the rights of workers and depletes resources that some countries
exporting to Europe. Compliance with these standards should guide the global economy on the way
sustainable development and allow, among others, the development of local commerce,
support to short circuits and relocated some jobs.

PRIORITY 5: DEVELOPING SOCIAL PROTECTION ACROSS ENTITIES
FEDERATED, additionally HAS A STRONG SOCIAL SECURITY FEDERAL
A number of skills managed under the Federal Social Security were
transferred to federal entities under the sixth state reform. This is the case of
family allowances, as well as some skills in the labor market or related
health care, seniors and persons with disabilities.
The federated entities, whose job it is to perpetuate the mission of our social security system
through these policies, now have the opportunity to make these devices
effective, more solidarity, more emancipatory, to strengthen social cohesion, while the
integrating the best of their current policies. Concrete proposals for Ecolo
the reception of new skills within the federated entities are contained in Chapters
theme "Employment and Vocational Training", "Health", "Seniors and Pensions", "Youth
and Youth Welfare "and" Institutional ".
Ecolo also identifies some overarching principles that guide best hospitality
these skills within the federated entities:
the association for reflection and management skills of these actors, the
foremost among the social partners, and users;
the development of these skills as part of a perspective Wallonia-Brussels
to ensure a common area of ​​solidarity, equal access to benefits and
the greatest possible consistency between Wallonia and Brussels, including through
fully implement the set of common principles and consultative bodies that have
adopted; more broadly, policy coordination between the federal state and
all federated entities, given the Belgian institutional context particularly
complex ;
the need to ensure continuity and to facilitate as much as possible the lives of beneficiaries
and service providers, so that the mobility of citizens and their access to benefits can
be hampered by the effects of this skills transfer.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter SOCIAL SECURITY - p 14/17

PRIORITY 6: PROMOTING SOCIAL INNOVATION AND TO STRENGTHEN
MODERNISE SOLIDARITY
The public systems of social protection, let alone social security, are more than ever
essential. As the above proposals show the good, and wishes to strengthen Ecolo
revitalize these public devices unambiguously.
To overcome the challenges we face, we must also mobilize
innovation and creativity at all levels. In this respect, Ecolo pays special attention to
Many social innovations that are developing in Belgium and in the world. By innovations
Social means new responses to poorly or dissatisfied social needs: employment,
aging, childcare, housing, health, social cohesion ...
Often these social innovations are brought by citizens or groups of citizens
Federated within organizations (formal or informal) social economy. They can take
a variety of forms: accompanied social credit, food banks, exchange services
premises, development of complementary currencies promoting solidarity (like Fureai
Kippu Japan), cities and districts in transition ...
The social economy in Belgium represents 16.7% of salaried employment and consists of activities
Economic performed by companies, mainly cooperatives, mutual societies and
associations whose ethics translates generally by the following principles:
purpose of service to members or the community rather than profit;
management autonomy;
democratic decision-making;
primacy of people and labor over capital in the distribution of income.
Social economy organizations make profits when they should wholly or
mainly reinvest to achieve social or environmental purposes they
are set. For example, instead of giving dividends to shareholders, an organization
Credit Social Economy may decide to offer credit at more affordable rates to its
beneficiaries, a worker cooperative may decide to invest in better machines,
a social service may decide to improve the quality of services offered, etc.
Often these organizations address significant unmet needs by private companies
Profit and the State. Being locally rooted and de facto better identification needs,
including emerging needs, these social economy organizations have long been
Already a pioneer in social innovation.
Historically, social economy initiatives have also often preceded action
authorities. Subsequently, it is not uncommon for governments to take over
responses previously tested by social economy organizations. Upon initiation
a social security system in Belgium, the management of the sickness and disability insurance was, for
example, entrusted to mutual occupying the grounds of mutual aid for more than half a century already. At the level of social welfare and home help, associations preceded
Also public initiatives coming out of the Second World War.
In order to promote social innovation, Ecolo therefore wishes to encourage the development of
social economy initiatives, continuing its long tradition of support to the third sector and
the plural economy.
Specifically, Ecolo offers:
amplify and strengthen mechanisms to facilitate access to
Funding for these organizations (strengthening the capital of cooperatives, granting
bank guarantees or loans ...);

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter SOCIAL SECURITY - p 15/17

to facilitate exchanges between different actors, accumulating and disseminating
results of research, field and pilot projects, promoting visits and
on the ground exchanges;
accompany and support the structurally existing initiatives that have made the
evidence of social innovation and facilitate their replication, while respecting their
autonomy and equal treatment of different initiatives of the same type;
ensure structural funding and regularity of payment of grants to these
associations ;
to facilitate the development of management tools to these organizations and the
professionalize;
to grant special aid to social innovations, for example by
social innovation on a par with technological innovation.

FIGHT AGAINST INSECURITY
An egalitarian society
Status and political horizon
State of play
If the Belgians are collectively among the richest people in the world, the calculation of the
average value of their heritage, however occult growing inequality in the distribution
wealth. Along global wealth increases, we see indeed a
general rise of socioeconomic insecurity.
This, reinforced by the serious social and financial crises, appears through a
series of worrying indicators:
The number of beneficiaries of social integration income has grown 14% since 2008;
15.3% of the Belgian population lives below the poverty line (defined at 60% of income
median) against 14.7% in 2008. This poverty affects more young people up to 18
years old and seniors 65 and over;
Women (16%) are more at risk of poverty than men
(14.6%); single parents - mostly women - are
also a particularly vulnerable group because their risk of poverty is
36%;
5.2% of Belgian households falls below the poverty line due to credits
consumption ;
30.1% of the population finds it difficult to cover their housing expenses and
Tenants risk of poverty is three times higher than that of owners (29%
for tenants against 10% for owners);
5.1% of the Belgian population lives in a household with a member who had to postpone or
cancel health care during the past year for financial reasons (against
2.7% in 2008);
about 660,000 workers are unemployed.
The perceived poverty is a useful complementary indicator to the more detailed objectives indicators
above. Thus the EU-SILC survey of 2011 revealed that 20.8% of the Belgian population indicated
have difficulty or great difficulty to get by.
In comparison with neighboring countries, Belgium, with Germany, the percentage
largest population living below the poverty line (15.3%) (Netherlands 10%, France
13%; Luxembourg 14%). Unlike these countries, it is the lack of homogeneity in the
distribution of poverty risk among different age groups which is particularly
striking in Belgium. Thus, apart from Belgium, the maximum difference between two rates of poverty
5% in the Netherlands between the middle age group (9%) and young (14%). In Belgium,
the maximum difference between poverty rate rises to 10% and separates middle age category
(13%) and those aged over 65 (23%).

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter FIGHT AGAINST INSECURITY - p 1/24

This development is particularly worrying in terms of social justice. It is also more
overall, in terms of social welfare, since various authors1 demonstrated that
the most unequal and dual societies are the nest of phenomena of violence and insecurity,
problems of addiction, mental health, obesity ... and wear and affect the well-being
all its members.

Social justice as a political project
The ecological transition of society carried by Ecolo necessarily requires a society where
wealth distribution is more balanced, both in Belgium, Europe and between North and
South2. It is not a utopia, but a necessary condition for the prosperity of each and
sustainability.
Specifically, in addition to access to basic rights such as housing, health, education,
this means ensuring dignified living conditions, among others, which pass
the increase in salaries, pensions and allowances of the lowest in Belgium.
The fight against poverty and insecurity is a cross policy. It is therefore for Ecolo
to address the issue of social policy and solidarity in all policies
conducted at all levels of power and prioritize social action to better meet the
needs of citizens.
Throughout this chapter, we will focus on proposals for fight against
precariousness. Since these proposals brew a wide range of policies, the majority
of them are further developed in the thematic chapters "Housing", "Employment and
vocational training "," Social security ", etc.) of the Ecolo program 2014, that we
invite to go.

The Ecolo force lines
To enable the transition to a more egalitarian society, should:
To ensure decent living conditions
CPAS to ensure the means of their missions and their social integration role;
To prevent the emergence of poverty, through a transversal approach to the fight against
poverty and sectoral policies for access to employment, housing, energy,
health, healthy eating;
To end the reproduction of poverty;
To fight against precariousness, having a long-term vision.

Priorities and proposals for Ecolo in the fight against
poverty
PRIORITY 1: CONDITIONS OF EXISTENCE OF ENSURING DECENT
If benefit recipients (pensioners, unemployed, disabled, handicapped ...)
are the first at risk of poverty, Workers are also
affected the growth of inequality. The latter are increasingly forced to accept

precarious and sometimes a wage below the poverty line, or even combine several
precarious jobs. Having a job does therefore not protect precarious workers. For Ecolo,
it is urgent, especially in a difficult economic environment, to ensure that each and every one
a decent income, regardless of social position, and stop the spiral of poverty. For this
do Ecolo offers include upgrade the minimum wage, pensions and allowances
social, preserve the indexation mechanism for salaries and social benefits that allows
to link this income to changes in the cost of living and establish a true connection to the well-being of
social benefits.
Because each citizen and European citizen has the right to live in dignity, Ecolo offers
upward harmonization of European social standards. For example, Ecolo offers
the eventual adoption of a guaranteed minimum income above the poverty threshold of the Member States
attached to at least 60% of the national median income.

Proposal: Meeting the minimum social benefits above the threshold poverty3
The current amount of sociale4 integration income does not live with a minimum of
dignity. For Ecolo, the minimum allocation must quickly exceed the poverty line (60%
of median income) or reaching € 1,000 per month for a single person. Eventually, in the
part of the individualization of rights, minimum must be the same for each person
regardless of his situation. This corresponds to address social minima above the threshold
poverty.
In this context, given their increased risk of poverty, single-parent families must
also be a priority.
It should meet the minimum of all social allowances, since otherwise,
many beneficiaries become, in turn, dependent on additional dependents
CPAS.

Proposal: Individualize the rights sociaux5
Ecolo proposes deepening the individualisation of rights, including the right to at
social integration income. This proposal aims to take account of the evolution of families,
remove current discrimination based on marital status or cohabitation, and allow
each adult to enjoy their own rights, regardless of your private links
another adult. Indeed, when the contributions are collected individually,
it does not hold true for the grant of benefits, where the notion of households prevail in case of
unemployment, disability allowance and pensions in particular. In absolute terms, this puts
undermined the principle of equality, most often to the detriment of women.6.
The non-individualisation of social rights, given the weakness of this income tends to
break the family or friendly solidarity, and pushes the individual to develop strategies,
depending on personal context, can sometimes raise more than the survival of the crime: black work,
fictitious domiciliation ...
Ecolo proposes the establishment of transitional arrangements allowing for the acquired situations,
individualisation of rights by landing and by age cohort, with priority for the suppression of
category of cohabiting in the diets of unemployment and disability benefits; alignment
General allowances and rights to present isolated category. In this perspective
individualization, the gradual conversion of the marital quotient will also be considered.

Proposal: Ensure full link social welfare benefits
At present, the automatic and complete link social welfare allowances is not
réalisée7. At most, the Government should it, every two years, taking a decision on a
"Coefficient" consultation liaison with the social partners. Nothing is decided
definitively on the scope of this adaptation in relation to the evolution of wealth. End
2011 the Federal Government decided to reduce by 40% the envelope for binding
Social welfare allocations for 2013 and 2014. If, recently some have minimum social
was increased by 2 8%, these increases nevertheless remain insufficient given
the rising price of basic needs (housing, energy and food in particular): they
do not prevent the stall allocations compared to the evolution of wealth.
It is therefore necessary to quickly provide an automatic and integral connecting all
social welfare allowances.

Proposal: Revaluate the minimum pension and link to the well-Centre9
By 2040, one in four people in Belgium will be 65 or more. One of the challenges related to
Population aging is particularly prevent tipping in poverty a
ever growing number of retirees. The absence of complete link to social allowances
Welfare has indeed resulted in a growing social and economic stall
particularly benefit recipients and beneficiaries of the pension modestes10. 17%
pensioners and pensioners living on an income below the poverty line.
It is therefore urgent to revalue the lowest pensions, including those of women,
smaller independent and older beneficiaries. Ecolo proposes to harmonize and
raise minimum pensions of employees, joint and independent careers to € 1,200 by
month (for a single) for a full career.

Proposal: Simplifying access to welfare and institute a "explorer
rights "
To request and obtain additional support, a person often has difficulty
subject to complex administrative procedures, including where these difficulties are already
known and recognized. Any new aid generally entails a new social survey,
the obligation to prove again its location, usually in a certain complexity
Administrative: Omnio status, energy funds, medical card, rental guarantee, school fees,
discount on the shipping cost ...
For example, many people who renounce the benefit of the Omnio status,
given the cumbersome steps they must take.

7
Every two years, the Federal Government must decide on the size and distribution of funds
for adaptation to the welfare income replacement benefits and social assistance benefits.
8
Increase of 2% of the income guarantee for the elderly (which then passes above the poverty line);
allowances to disabled and RIS; and primary incapacity benefits independent.

All our proposals in relation to pensions is in our chapter "Seniors and pensions."
10
The risk of poverty (calculated according to the European standard of 60% of median income) is clearly higher among
People pensioners than active individuals and it is even higher among the pensioners and pensioners
older: if in 2001 it was estimated that 13% of the Belgian population lived below the poverty line, as was the case for 26%
among those over 65, and even if it is generally in the elderly that heritage is highest (but
this heritage is distributed fairly low). Older people also experience more difficulty out
this poverty. The percentage of long-term poverty is 18% in the elderly against
8% for the total population.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter FIGHT AGAINST INSECURITY - p 4/24

Just like the map 'Health' 11 set up by the CPAS of Namur, Ecolo therefore proposes
generalizing measures for simplification of administrative procedures required of
citizens.

Ecolo also offers more automatic aid. Thus, within each of SEDA, it
is possible to provide the definition, from external existing databases (Omnio ...) or
internal (beneficiaries of the integration income, social assistance, debt mediation, awarded
the heating allowance ...), categories of people who can access automatically
recurrent interventions (support for health care, interventions in the framework of the plan
Action and Prevention energy ...), without resorting again to the stress of a
social inquiry. The automation of recognition as a beneficiary status for Omnio
all interested parties thus appears priority.
Ecolo also proposes to establish an "Explorer Rights" in the Brussels Region and at
Federal and strengthening the existing project in Wallonia. This tool is designed to gather
on a website all employment-related assistance, training, energy, health,
the environment, transport, mobility, etc. Such aid will be broken down according to the
personal situation. Ecolo proposes that this web site be coupled with a "wicket
unique "within each CPAS, to assist the board and the steps of the beneficiaries,
including those who do not have access to the web, in aid applications or
premiums. The rights Explorer is also a valuable tool for social workers
who will benefit from all the information to be transmitted to recipients.
For Ecolo, the proposal must be accompanied by a simplification of existing aid as well
a larger automatic thereof whenever possible.

Proposal: To allow an adaptation of the aid depending on the situation
people and avoid unemployment traps
The proliferation of precarious employment (temporary jobs of short duration, split times), causes more
and more regularly a loss of revenue for welfare recipients who are able to
to get a job. Childcare costs, travel, loss of social benefits
Complementary and low wages explain this particularly penalizing situation for
only people with children, and especially so for women. Such a situation
obviously leads to distortions and is a trap to emploi12.
For Ecolo, it is therefore to limit or eliminate the loss of benefits by organizing
a transitional system, to allow people who accept a job in exchange for
their allocation, to continue to benefit, during a certain period, benefits that were
related to their previous status. Ecolo also proposes to grant benefits on the basis
a reference income below which a person may continue to receive some
benefits, and not based on a statute (of job seeker, the beneficiary
... RIS) 13. The transition from a calculation method to the other should be done gradually.

Proposal: Improving access to basic banking service
Ecolo also proposes to improve access to basic banking service by removing any condition
linked to the existence of an ongoing credit. Indeed, although the number of banks has sharply excluded
decreased (40,000 in 2003, 10,000 in 2005) following the entry into force of the Law on Service
bank base, some people are still denied the opening of a current account.

Map induces a simplification and systemization of the reimbursement of care, paying directly CPAS
doctors and pharmacists.

An employment trap is a situation where the incentive for the jobseeker to seek or accept employment is
insignificant or nonexistent. For more information on the proposed Ecolo on this, see Chapter "Social Security".

This proposal does not address certain age-related benefits such as preferential tariffs
transportation for youth or seniors.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter FIGHT AGAINST INSECURITY - p 5/24

This greatly complicates the lives of these people and goes against social inclusion therefore
that access to a more and more services and goods requires the use of
basic payment services. This concerns mostly indebted people (see
infra), people do not speak the automation of banking or persons
of foreign origin.
The device of the law must therefore be improved to further open access to view account
removing the condition linked to the existence of an ongoing credit.

PRIORITY 2: GUARANTEE FOR CPAS MEANS OF THEIR MISSIONS AND
ROLE OF SOCIAL INCLUSION
The CPAS has more and more difficulties in ensuring their missions. Since 2008, there has been a
14% growth of persons entitled to social integration income (RIS) 14. Indeed, the
consequences of the worsening economic climate adds a load transfer from the
Federal Government, particularly through its policy of sanctions and exclusion of
jobseekers.
Ecolo intends to make CPAS ways to ensure their missions, but also develop
other dimensions of social action that are the social and civic integration, strengthen and
respect the collaboration with local stakeholders and the associative fabric and draw with them
lines of a coherent, sustainable and emancipatory. In this context, it should remove the
CPAS a strict role employability and placing it as the central pivot of the insert
social and citizen.

Proposal: Guarantee policy instruments sufficient and appropriate for action
CPAS
For Ecolo, it is necessary to increase the means of action of the CPAS, including increasing
share of federal intervention in the RIS. Ecolo proposes to increase this share, which oscillates today
between 50 and 65% (depending on the number of people accompanied) to 90%. Federal intervention
Current and late repayment are causing the depletion of certain common
and are likely to curb these much needed initiatives for human dignity
aidées15 people. Moreover, Belgium is one of the few countries where social assistance is dependent
common and not borne by the federal state. Ecolo believe that solidarity should be organized
in the broadest level and that the realization of the right to human dignity can not be left to the
sole responsibility of municipal authorities, themselves often impoverished. A supported
Federal also allow more equal treatment of recipients
communes16 different.
This measure is all the more necessary that the period of 1976-2010, the number of
beneficiaries of the RIS has increased by 10 and continues to grow ... while the number of
social workers has only doubled. It goes without saying that social workers are overloaded
and work tirelessly in an emergency. It seems difficult in such conditions to leave

14

"While growth in the average monthly number of persons entitled to social integration was between 1.7%
and 3.5% from 2004 to 2008, it reached 9% in 2009. Although slower than in 2009, growth in 2010,
a rate of 4.8%, remained above the rates observed before the economic and financial crisis of late 2008. In 2011,
the average monthly number of beneficiaries is always located above the level observed in 2008: 104 342 beneficiaries
average against 92,357 in 2008, or 13% more »PPS Social Integration, 02.08.2013.
15
Ecolo has filed a bill to this effect: 53K1164
16
This claim is borne by the Union of Cities and Municipalities of Wallonia, the Association of the City and the Municipalities
of the Brussels-Capital Region and the Union of Towns and Communes of Flanders; it also responds to various
observations of the Service against poverty, precariousness and social exclusion.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter FIGHT AGAINST INSECURITY - p 6/24

the curative approach of social assistance, or even a form of assistantship (various funds, checks, aids
point ...).
Meanwhile, Ecolo wants part of CPAS social workers be strengthened and that
these workers have more time for training and supervision. The possibility should
their being offered to work on collective or community dynamics in certain places
or neighborhoods or on specific topics (indebtedness, energy, housing), beyond the
support for individual situations. Such an approach helps to fight against isolation
people and create or strengthen solidarity increasingly undermined by the emergency
situations and the lack of adequate means of action.

Proposal: Provide support for sustainable integration projects
Most CPAS developed an integration for beneficiaries of the RIS. Thus, the
budgets "insertion" of the CPAS have they increased sharply, while the number of jobs
"Article 60" 17 was thirteen times in 15 years. For Ecolo, the logic of integration pathways do
may be essentially utilitarian, ie to provide cheap labor
or used to improve the employment rate figures. Indeed, Ecolo considers it essential that the choice of
people is respected, a real individualized integration project can be proposed and their
built with them. Alongside this course and access to employment, should be taken into account
social difficulties that people often face. In this framework,
support is still needed, whether in housing, health or under
a difficult family situation.
Furthermore, the quality of jobs and their outcome, namely sustainable reintegration, must
take precedence over quantity. This integration work can in fact be limited to back to work and must
incorporate an aspect of sustainable reintegration approach undoubtedly requires reinforcement
staff within the CPAS.

Proposal: Allow students receiving support CPAS follow studies
of their choice
Just like the general population, more and more young people and students living in
precarious socioeconomic conditions. Young people today constitute a public third
CPAS receiving support, both in Wallonia and Brussels; and 8% of 18-19 year saw an allowance
CPAS. These figures reflect an alarming poverty and often in solitude
why more and more young people are immersed.
As part of welfare contracts between CPAS students, CPAS assume the right
to judge the ability of a student or not to continue his studies or to propose a
reorientation. Situations differ greatly from a SEDA to the other, resulting in a
geographical discrimination. Ecolo supports harmonization of procedures, solidarity
CPAS between having more students than others being guaranteed by the reimbursement to 90% of RIS
(see above).
Thus, there is access to the university sometimes refused because these studies are considered too long;
some guidance (such as history or art) are refused on the grounds of lack of
opportunities. Furthermore, the application of certain provisions such as the obligation of the
work in difficult to reconcile with the time studies, combined with an amount of
Revenue of social integration that decreases when the power at work, proves counterproductive.
While respecting the autonomy of CPAS, Ecolo wants the creation of a status for the student
émarge the CPAS, to enable it to continue studies of their choice, under conditions
17

Section 60 enables the CPAS to hire someone under an employment contract to allow him to open the right to
unemployment benefit or gain work experience. The employment contract is executed or in the CPAS,
or from a third party.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter FIGHT AGAINST INSECURITY - p 7/24

worthy of existence. Ecolo also proposes to remove the age limit of 25 years imposed on
CPAS receiving support people who want to start studying, because a person must
to benefit from the possibility to reorient his career, through training
in higher education.
Moreover, the CPAS students receiving support may not be compelled to a reorientation in case
failure. They should be treated equally compared to other students and therefore be free
to continue their studies as long as they are financeable student status. The law must also
prohibit the CPAS to require the student to work during the summer months if it is to be a
second session.

Proposal: Move towards a harmonization of procedures
The criteria for granting medical aid, types of care providers and services
accessible, the height of the financial assistance and the terms of this intervention
example, may vary greatly from one to another SEDA. Like all other social benefits,
medical aid can therefore be attributed more or less restrictive or generous according to
fiscal situation of the municipality or in the political attention paid to public health and
Prevention and budgetary decisions that result.
In all cases where the specificity of public does not call differentiated policies, is Eco
for a gradual harmonization of CPAS procedures by aligning the systems
more respectful of the rights of citizens in difficulty.

Proposal: To ensure compliance of the beneficiaries and their contribution to
improving the functioning of the CPAS
For Ecolo, the CPAS is not a single political and administrative body consisting of
social workers, but is a structure that aims to support and accompany people.
As such, regardless of the method of participation, should be integrated into the rightholders
improving this structure and operation, for example by supporting the creation
collective beneficiaries or by a public hearing the Council of Social action
not about people.
Moreover, in the relationship between CPAS and beneficiaries, the rights and privacy of these
must be respected. For example, home visits CPAS staff are
essential meeting moments that should not be thought of as moments alone
control, but also as a moment of exchange, with mutual respect, and a possibility for
the social worker or meet the person in his environment. The role of workers
Social priority should be focused on social support and not on the control.

PRIORITY 3: PREVENT THE OCCURRENCE OF POVERTY BY APPROACH
CROSS-SECTORAL POLICIES AND ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT, THE
HOUSING, A ENERGY, HEALTH AND FOOD AND THROUGH
STRENGTHENING THE FIGHTING SOCIAL ISOLATION
Poverty is often linked to a combination of factors foremost of which is located
the organization of the company and the allocation of financial and other resources (access to
housing, health, education, services ...). If the social protection system and
guaranteed minimum wage levels are one of the answers to poverty, access to employment,
housing and the aforesaid services is another. It is vital that governments put

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter FIGHT AGAINST INSECURITY - p 8/24

implement the necessary policies to enable everyone to enjoy e-rights
fundamentals.
Other parameters can influence the risk of poverty: the size of the family,
gender, disability or belonging to an ethnic minority. Thus large families and
parent (higher fees, little income ...) and women (lower-paid jobs,
smaller pensions ...) are more at risk of poverty. It should therefore be
consider the impact of policies on the situation of these people.
For Ecolo it is appropriate both to act in sectoral policies and ensure
transversal approach to the fight against poverty in view of the multitude of areas on
where action is needed to prevent and eradicate poverty.

Proposal: To develop a transversal approach to the fight against
poverty
An effective fight against poverty requires a cross-cutting approach in the long run,
all policies and all levels of power. Poverty does not effect limited to
a poverty management policy but requires concerted political action, business
social economic affairs, including through energy policy, employment,
training and mobility. Such coordination and necessary cross are not yet
become a reflex.
If each entity has adopted measures to fight against poverty, Ecolo wish this
policy is the subject of a real integrated plan with strategic and cross-cutting objectives, to
allow concerted action and involvement of all sector policies in the
fight against poverty, like for example the Action Plan for fight against Brussels
Poverty in place for this purpose.

Proposal: To preserve the autonomy of the Service against poverty
The 2011 federal government agreement provided for the transfer of the Service against the
poverty, precariousness and social exclusion to social inclusion SPF. Ecolo opposes such
transfer, such as to undermine the guarantee of independent reporting and criticism from the point of
Contact given that report directly to the authority of the Minister defining policy
fight against poverty.
The focal point of the fight against poverty is now housed within the Centre for
equal opportunities and the fight against racism, public service acting independently. he
responsibilities include making recommendations to various levels of government (State
federal and federated entities). It is therefore a key player in the transverse policy
lead in the fight against poverty. For Ecolo, its autonomy, its independence,
Interfederal character and privileged interlocutor with field associations must
therefore be preserved.

Proposal: Develop a Plan for Literacy
Illiteracy is a source of democratic deficit and represents a real barrier to access
employment and social life. It is therefore urgent to consolidate and make structural means
granted to associations that develop literacy activities. It should further not
not restrict literacy training to the sole objective of socio-professional integration for
meet the needs of pensioners, housewives, illegal immigrants ... Social action must
incorporate this issue directly.
People who do not know (or little) read or write are clearly disabilities in their
Attempts to social and / or professional. Although some association members

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter FIGHT AGAINST INSECURITY - p 9/24

developing actions towards them, the offer is still inadequate and too many people are
not affected by these services.
Ecolo offers:
to develop, as the Flemish Community, a coordinated literacy plan. This
plan should be initiated by a platform bringing together associations of providing
courses, public services, trade unions, employers and Action Services
social. It should be declined in each catchment area, in order to really set
establish permanent territorial systems of literacy, which would
unite around a project built together local actors fight against
exclusion;
to improve the detection of illiteracy and ensure the emergence applications
supporting experiments rigging public;
promoting access for all to education and therefore literacy ... and thus avoid
concentrate resources on social and professional integration; learners or learners
potentials are also women and men in the home, the pensioner-es, the
asylum seekers, people in very precarious ... that are not registered in
a job search;
improve the training of trainers;
to strengthen the structural funds allocated to operators, to stabilize shares
course.

Proposal: To facilitate access for all to employment and to refuse
the impoverishment of the unemployed
The job does not always guarantee dignified conditions of life, but it helps greatly.
But the labor market produces exclusions the financial consequences but also
devastating social and family. Increased degression of unemployment benefits and
lengthening the insertion internship decided by the outgoing Federal majority reinforce this
growing insecurity.
Ecolo therefore proposes several actions to facilitate access to employment.
Review the support systems for job seekers, so they do not produce
social exclusion
Since 2004 the establishment of the unemployed activation map produced negative effects
the unemployed and for workers in charge of their support, although
beyond the objectives announced in terms of punishment of abuse:
sanctions are often arbitrary;
The activation plan affects more poor and impoverishes;
it generates significant mental health problems in some individuals who are made
carry the load of the employment deficit;
it is very effective in employment updates;
it induces a serious confusion in the role of "employment" advisers Utilities
Regional forced to participate in the control of the unemployed while being responsible for their
accompaniment;
it is partly responsible for the deterioration of status and working conditions of
workers (job seekers being virtually forced to accept any job
says "suitable");

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter FIGHT AGAINST INSECURITY - p 10/24

it weighs heavily on federal finances (NEO controllers), regional (that activate
sometimes stirring the job seeker through training workshops "carousel") and
communal (supported by the CPAS of sanctioned individuals).
For Ecolo, there can be no penalty if the jobseeker refuses a previously
employment actually "appropriate".
Faced with the structural shortage of jobs, Ecolo proposes to reform the support system
unemployed to:
avoid any unjustified sanction in view of the current economic context;
redirect resources mobilized directly or indirectly by the activation plan
to a suitable support for job seekers, respectful of their project
professional, who is part of a climate of trust and a constructive approach;
to strengthen the capacity for the development of the training of job seekers,
considering it first as a law and a way to learn, not as
a new social obligation.
Furthermore, as part of the next regionalization of control availability, Ecolo
proposes that:
the guide and controller functions are distinguished;
data transmission (the companion to the controller) or "qualitative" and
of all the known procedure (job seekers, operators ...)
the job seeker has only one action plan that makes sense;
clear rules are set for distant public employment (better reflect
their plight);
equal treatment is the rule for all sub-regions;
the control device (such as coaching) is managed with
social partners.
Finally, it should be deleted degression and time limitation of allowances
unemployment and the lengthening of the waiting period. The new system for calculating allocations
Unemployment leads one very quickly the unemployed allowance at a level which no longer allows
ensure a decent life and even fewer have the means to seek employment.
The outgoing government has decided to limit to three years the insertion allowances. From 2015,
Many are unemployed and unemployed women, isolated es, capital fe-s families or cohabiting es
who will be deprived of benefits and returned to family solidarity, resourcefulness or CPAS.
Furthermore, at the end of their studies, young people have seen their unemployment period without right
extended at least 12 months. Many young people receive negative evaluations to
consistent with planned economies. For Ecolo, the insertion internship must become a real
Accompanying period and should allow rapid access to sufficient income
to live and look for work.
Reconciling employment and precarious public
Make precarious meet public and employers is an original way to make it possible for
first, the prospect of finding a job. This is by distance with the immediacy of
precariousness that the real rehabilitation work is made possible. Thus, access to a stable job,
quality, fulfilling, adequately paid, and if possible, indefinite (CDI)
is an essential response to the output of precariousness.
To do this, the IOD method ("Intervention on vacancies and job applications") used
for over 25 years in France, aims to reduce selective hiring practices of employers

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter FIGHT AGAINST INSECURITY - p 11/24

integrating all individuals, especially the most precarious. It is an accompaniment
recruitment companies, focusing on CDI.
It is to move from the logic of the adequacy of the job seeker in the labor market at a
work with employers to convince them to hire based on the person's ability to
fulfill the specifications inherent to the task to be assigned to them, and not on
"employability" of the candidate or the candidate. For the employer, the gain is that
provided by the intermediate body as in the selection and in the discreet accompaniment
the worker and of the latter's relationship with the employer (which also has a win
professionalisation of the recruitment process) in the beginning of their contractual relationship.
Knowing that most employers in Belgium are often poor for SMEs
recruitment procedures, this method can be a response to a need expressed by
Many employers.
In Belgium, this approach has already been implemented successfully in various places, such as
several Liege CPAS, the Brussels Region and the Regional Mission for integration and employment
Charleroi.
Ecolo proposes to generalize its application in the different sub-regions in collaboration
with regional and local employment missions and other field actors and, via
subsidies for the establishment of social work teams able to go
Contact employers to convince them to give a chance to precarious workers and
accompany the start of this new relationship.
Such an initiative can have a leverage effect on the rest of the labor market, allowing
each perform work in connection with its real skills and helping small and
medium enterprises to ask the best hiring choices.
Striving for social inclusion, alongside the professional integration
The advantage of integration or social participation is not just about young people. All
adults, especially the least skilled and the most vulnerable, need to be sustained and that
acknowledged their involvement with their families or society.
Ecolo therefore considers it necessary to encourage and support some social activities like
"Relay" business training or employment periods, and gradually recognize those
that meet a need. The sense of worthlessness or rupture after periods of activity (
training, employment) affect the mind of the persons concerned and can dip them in
dark periods. However, social integration (like volunteering or facility construction
with other partners in a social project, articulating both social activities and mutual support
eg cooperative), provides social support, wellness, proactive vis-à-vis
in general and employment opportunities especially life.
To achieve this goal, Ecolo therefore wishes socio-professional integration that does summarize
most to employment marketing 'classic' work but also planning through
social activities in adaptées18 structures. The role of Social Integration Services (SIS), the
up by certain SEDA must be reaffirmed and encouraged, as well as the extension thereof
by other CPAS. Their usefulness is undeniable especially in a recession
economic and structural shortage of jobs.

Proposal: Ensuring access to a housing décent19
For Ecolo, access to decent housing is the starting point for a dignified life.
Housing policies are an integral part of social equity policies. It is therefore a

See on this subject our proposals for the disabled, Chapter "Disability".

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter FIGHT AGAINST INSECURITY - p 12/24

Ecolo priority to enable every household to have access to quality housing at a price
decent. To do this, several joint actions are needed.
Help tenants access to decent housing by strengthening existing aid and
increasing the supply of affordable housing
Continue to increase the number of public housing up to 2500 / year in Wallonia
and 2000 / year in the Brussels Region;
Strengthen existing aid and better articulate: relocation allowance, the aid
Solidarity Fund of the Housing Code, allowances, rents;
Spread the housing social purpose (social housing agency, etc.);
Regulate the private housing;
Increasing the number of supported housing for specific audiences (persons
disabled, formerly homeless ...).
Help low and middle income households to acquire their homes by strengthening
means of public actors
Strengthen the capacity of public bodies such as the Housing Fund, the SDRB, the
Company Walloon Social Credit;
Encourage the production of new housing sales price (or rent)
accessible to the greatest number, through fiscal measures, while ensuring quality
architectural achievements.
Ending winter evictions in private homes, in consultation with the
representatives of landlords and tenants.

Proposal: To fight against fuel poverty
The evolution of energy prices and the economic crisis putting more and more households
financial difficulty, depriving them of the means to confront the profound changes
energy sector. Fuel poverty now affects not only more citizens
the most precarious.
Statistics show that the energy consumption increases with wealth
households (this is due both to the size of housing, temperature and the number of parts
heated, or to the degree of comfort and equipment in particular). By cons if
the poorest deciles consume less, the share of income spent on energy bills
is greater. Almost 30% of Belgian households spend 10% of their income or more
for énergie20.
Furthermore, more specifically in the Brussels Region, it is challenging to see a very relationship
strong between the status of the occupier and the energy quality of the accommodation: and tenants
occupy poorly insulated homes, mainly located in the center and the first ring
Brussels. Finally, the impact of rising electricity prices is proportionally
much more important for most people précaires21.
Rethink its energy consumption is not easy and requires resources,
in particular to make the necessary investments that will reduce the invoice
energy. It is therefore essential to continue and amplify the measures taken to ensure

providing a minimum amount of energy at an acceptable price for everyone and
facilitate procedures for energy savings.
Moreover, these measures must be part of an overall struggle against poverty. In
Indeed, the issues related to energy bills regularly go with situations
debt (see below). Thus, for some households, regardless of the measures to
improve energy quality of housing, incomes are insufficient to
honor the bills. If the priority is the rehabilitation of these revenus22, also offers Ecolo
a definition of energy poverty that allows to open the right for households
this situation to intervention intended to stabilize their energy bills, and more
generally to reduce their energy bill (investments to save energy) 23.
Acting on the quality of housing

Link the cost of housing in its energy quality: Households often hold weakened
housing less well maintained and isolated, with equipment with energy efficiency
is bad, which often leads to energy bills above average. Of
measures similar to those for the health quality of housing could be introduced,
correspondence such as housing to a certain level of energy performance for its
renting out. Furthermore, it should limit increases in rent property the
renovation was aided by the government. It is indeed not desirable that an owner
enjoys public support and subsequently completed a profit at the expense of tenants who
that can hardly enjoy the same support. This is sort of a contract concluded
with the owners.

Acting on housing: Measures similar to those of Wallonia must be Ecopack24
extended and amplified. Ecolo also proposes developing collective approaches
such as the renovation district by district with development of local energy sources
(renewable but also micro-cogeneration energy). New public policies
could be developed to mobilize households and to accompany them, through
collective actions, but also through support to municipalities, in collaboration with the
distribution system operator (DSO) (communication at the time of the index noted in
a city or a neighborhood outreach letters to high consumption or have
increased significantly, etc.).

Acting on equipment to save energy: When a household is in debt mediation
or benefit from assistance from the CPAS for reasons of energy, should be considered as one euro
to pay the bill, the public power adds one euro for energy saving in housing,
the creditor whether or not the owner. It would be possible to subsequently recover part of
Investment from the owner if it does not occupy the dwelling itself. In all cases,
households that are already struggling to pay an energy bill must be priority
for aid to energy-saving investments, precisely to provide a solution
their structural problem, hence the idea of ​​a Euro to pay the debt and to support euro
energy savings. Specific approach and support strategies must be
developed for these insecure households that can hardly invest. By expanding
Walloon Mebar program (low income households) in actions on the building envelope, and
by providing people with payment difficulties passing team that could make
Small energy saving work (up to an amount to be determined), it would be possible to have a
more lasting effect on the consumption of these households with payment difficulties.

22

See our proposal to raise social benefits above the poverty line.
Such a definition should ensure assistance to households actual fuel poor. Thus, the
RIS passage of unemployment (via Article 60, for example) lost a series of public welfare assistance while the person
could still be in fuel poverty.

The Ecopack is a loan at 0% for the Walloon households wishing to improve the energy performance of their
by housing renovations. Furthermore, additional bonuses can be immediately deducted from
repayment installments. http://www.ecopack-wallonie.be

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter FIGHT AGAINST INSECURITY - p 14/24

Acting on individual meters: While the legislation provides (RBC obligation; obligation
in some cases RW), some properties are not individually metered. The
consequences are often negative for households in general and those living in
especially poverty. Indeed, the absence of individual meters precludes the possibility of
receive free kWh, of maximum social prices or the opportunity to appear before
a local board. Furthermore, the fact of not knowing his individual consumption and
having to share the costs do nothing to encourage the rational use of energy. In Wallonia, Ecologist
proposes that funding for the placement of individual meter either owner.
Protect the weak fluctuations of energy

Continue implementation of a tiered pricing:
Maintaining, for fuel oil, existing social measures such as oil funds
by introducing in a first step the same rate regardless of the amount
consumed. Ecolo also offers automatic monthly payment of the invoice
heating oil.
Paying for the gas, the distributor, the same as for aid funds
heating oil.
To do this, Ecolo offers a fusion of energy fédéraux25 funds for social purposes.

Automate and reduce the social rate:
Grant the social rate based on the income of a person and not on the basis of his status.
A clearance plan of debt when there is one, and free energy audit
should be offered to those customers.
Review tax conditions of a budget meter and a power limiter. They
does not constitute a solution to the access to the energy problem. Ecolo believes that before
the placement of a counter budget, a debt settlement plan and audit
Free energy must be offered to the customer by the distributor. It is also
necessary to regulate the method of calculating the amount of provisions based on the
annual consumption of the customer and the rational use of energy measures
by the latter to avoid excessive payments.
In Wallonia, reactivate local Commissions Energy (CLE) to give them a role
leading in the fight against fuel poverty.

Regulate the prices of passive clients: Although they are fewer and fewer, more
Thousands of customers have not chosen their supplier and are provided by default by the operator
appointed by the DSO during the liberalization of the gas and electricity markets. The rates
applied to these clients are often among the most expensive market.
Establish a single window with a local antenna in each CPAS: The wicket
sole function would be to support both households into default than those who
are having trouble paying their bills and more generally all households
encounter difficulties in the liberalized market (calculation of the intermediate invoice choice
supplier, legal assistance in case of problems, etc.). The existing mediation service would be part
This one-stop shop. Before any litigation proceedings between supplier and customer, it should be
ensure the passage of the dossier by the services of the mediator.
Furthermore, clients and social workers are not always able to write
mail when there is dispute or that the supplier does not fulfill his duties. Creating a
legal service within the one-stop shop to benefit consumers (on the model
InforGazElec of Brussels) would partly compensate for this problem.

Proposal: Ensuring access to health care

26

When household incomes are low, it often happens that health expenditures are
reported that prescribed medicines are not answered or the inability to pay
invoices contributes to over-indebtedness. In addition, the occupation of substandard housing and lack
healthy diet have a significant impact on health, causing significant expenses
thereafter. Considering further that the life expectancy is much less fortunate
faible27, Ecolo proposes the following measures to ensure access for everyone to health care
health.
Omnio grant the status automatically and without prior formality complex
Ecolo for anyone whose incomes are below the ceiling opening the right to
plus repayments, should automatically benefit from the status Omnio. Furthermore, if
limit, as at present, access to the Omnio status to a lower income ceiling for families
the poorest, the result, for example, a person unemployed actively seeking the
finding work and at most a few months interim, is being penalized by losing access to that
status. Ecolo therefore proposes the creation of an Omnio system more widely available, including
workers 'poor' and a + Omnio system for families living situations
the heaviest of poverty.
Increase the rate of reimbursement of general medicine to the lowest insured
Ecolo proposes to increase the repayment of the consultation of the general practitioner of 95 to
100% for persons under the statutes and Omnio Omnio +. Currently, people in
precarious situations often go to the hospital rather than to the GP, just
because the billing is delayed by the hospital and they do not have sufficient liquidity
to pay for a consultation. This can lead to unnecessary spending in terms of exams
Complementary and hospitalizations, and represents a cost for health insurance like
the patient, not to mention the risk of debt.
Improving tariff transparency, to limit surprises
The requirement for any provider to display in his waiting room if it is subsidized or not is
now enshrined in law, on the initiative of Ecolo. To go further it is necessary to push
care providers to post their rates for the most common benefits.
Reduce drug prices
Ecolo proposes to strengthen the regulation of prices for medicinal products, including the
"Submarket" of generic drugs. In particular should act on development
packaging adapted to the durations of treatment to avoid having to buy too
large quantities. Furthermore, it is important to continue the progressive extension type mechanism
"Kiwi", which is a measure to regulate prices of medicines by tender.

Proposal: To ensure access to safe and quality food
Food is a vital yet often reduced expenditure to a minimum, and
thus to products whose quality is not always the rendezvous. Besides measures
to ensure a healthy diet, especially in public structures, Ecolo supports
specific measures to the most insecure households.

26

For more information on the proposed Ecolo health, see Chapter "Health".

Ensuring access to food aid
The European food aid program, established in 1987, currently provides food to
13 million people living in poverty in 19 Member States. Following an appeal
Germany, in September 2011, supported by Sweden, the European Court of Justice stated
illegal use of the Common Agricultural Policy funds to what it considers a
welfare program. In 2014, the budget will therefore drastically reduced when in
Belgium, for example, the European food aid is almost half of
the supply of food banks. Environmentalists claim that the new framework
European financial perpetuates this European program, as part of cohesion policy.
Furthermore, it should be developed at European level, innovative policy instruments
to support otherwise in an emancipatory perspective, households in precarious situations.
The EU must redefine in part the European Fund missions to help the poor (FEAD)
to become also an instrument of territorial solidarity, through the promotion of short circuits
in particular, and thus reconcile social and environmental innovation.
Establish a coherent system for collecting unsold food
The amount of unsold food discarded by the distribution sector can not we
challenge while in Belgium some do not have enough to eat. He agreed with the actors
local government, food banks and other social action organizations in consultation
with the food sector, ensuring the collection, storage and redistribution to benefit as
large number. Both voluntary and legally binding tools that can be considered.
Encourage collective and individual gardens
Should be encouraged alongside the CPAS and the voluntary sector, the development of
vegetable plots, paying special attention to the precarious public. Such
initiatives help strengthen social cohesion and enhance cultural diversity and
intergenerational in the area where the garden is located. They also allow
users benefit from fresh fruits and vegetables, they have helped to grow in
a joint project with others and to exchange experiences.
Ecolo such offers and systematize, where possible, the plant gardens
collective and vegetable gardens for housing social purpose.
Support the installation welfare grocery store
Social grocery stores are within a specific audience (beneficiaries of the integration income ...)
and practice floor prices for essential food items. Ecolo proposes that these
grocery stores are supported and that good practices, such as the sale of fresh products and
quality, through the distribution of baskets of fruits and vegetables for example, are widespread. Ecolo
Also proposes to consider the opportunity to develop checks fruits and vegetables.

PRIORITY 4: TO END POVERTY REPRODUCTION
A top priority is to fight against child poverty in order to break with the
reproduction of poverty. Ensure dignified existence of conditions, decent incomes,
better reconciliation of work and family life, housing, employment, access to
energy, health and food, services; it is also ensuring the right for children
grow up and live in dignity.
Similarly, ensure access to free education to ensure equal opportunities in the
schooling and access to higher education also, since the risk of
Poverty decreases with the level of education, to stop the reproduction of poverty.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter FIGHT AGAINST INSECURITY - p 17/24

Proposal: Realizing the Rights of the Child by fighting poverty
If poverty is affecting more and more households, children are the first victims. In
Belgium, nearly one child in five is at risk of poverty; This gives our country the 5th least
good score of Europe!
Poverty threatens each of the rights of the child enshrined in the UN Convention
United, including:
the right to an adequate standard of living and thus to decent living conditions: children
living in poverty are in families where incomes are too low, living in
housing too small and sometimes unhealthy, often lacking the minimum of comfort
and hygiene;
the right to family life: according to the Observatory on Children, Youth and assistance
youth, two-thirds of investment in children under 7 years are related to difficulties
parents, from 7 to 11% solely due to their précarité28;
the right to health: children living in poverty suffer too often
malnutrition, have less protection against all forms of violence and abuse, and
less access to health care;
the right to education: children living in poverty often feel unwelcome
to school and face many obstacles throughout their schooling (school fees
too high cultural resources of their families do not correspond to those requested
by the school, little access to education, citizenship and participation, poor quality
relationship between the school and the family, abusive orientation to special education,
Future prematurely clogged ...);
the right to leisure and culture (recreational, sporting, artistic and cultural), the
right to justice, the right to participation ...
For Ecolo, it is urgent to improve the situation and access to rights of all children living in
sometimes extreme poverty, because it affects not only their development but also
because it jeopardizes their future prospects.
All of the above proposals is likely to fight against child poverty, as
Child poverty is intrinsically linked to that of their parents.

Proposal: Move towards the effective free education
If the International Convention on Children's Rights and the International Covenant on
economic, social and cultural devote free education, the school actually costs
still too expensive for parents, and this cost increases as and schooling. In a
School context of quasi-market, the practices of schools in terms of cost are for a
growing number of parents, decisive in the choice of école29.
Ecolo promotes an overall policy of reducing the cost of schooling to families and dependents
supported the decree introducing an obligation for schools to provide parents with a countdown
periodic school fees claimed. But to effectively reduce school fees and avoid
abuse, it will not ask further:
fixed by order a maximum amount for the said expenses "authorized" and evaluate the implementation
decrees implementing provisions for free (including the distinction between
mandatory and optional charge fees under the "Missions" decree;

assess the 90% rule 30 to effectively allow the greatest number of children
going on expatriation classes. Ecolo calls for the adoption, in consultation with the
representatives of education, families and classes of operators
disorientation, decree that would set in pedagogical quality criteria, safety,
consistency with educational content as well as a price ceiling;
encourage schools to adopt good practices free having made their
Evidence in other schools (bulk orders, grants to
school supplies, etc.);
ensure free for teachers in educational activities organized
school setting, without this be done through an additional cost burden to students and
their families.

Proposal: Removing financial barriers to access to higher education
Higher education is welcoming more and more students each year. This is massification
nevertheless faces several obstacles, made visible by the high failure rate in the first
year and their close link with the socio-economic background of students. Various efforts have been
undertaken for several years in the fight against the unequal access to education
superior. They deserve to be pursued and evaluated.
Since the academic year 2010, new measures in favor of free
higher education and are in force. Registration fees have been frozen for all
students and reduced to zero euro for scholarship students. The latter may also
receive free printing of compulsory course materials now available
Online equally free.
Some difficulties have arisen in the application of the provisions on media
progress: many potential beneficiaries are misinformed and / or undergoing procedures
prohibitive, and teachers were sometimes subjected to excessive constraints resulting from
too strict application of the decree. It appears therefore necessary to evaluate these measures in order to
improve effectiveness. Some institutions have distinguished themselves by good practices such
that the introduction of a voucher system allowing the scholarship student to benefit from the
free course materials without having to move the amount when purchasing. These good practices
benefit from being generalized. However, free distribution of course materials required
currently a voluntary process of the students. Some do not undertake for fear of being
stigmatized. Consequently, higher education institutions should offer all
scholarship student free course materials. The online update available must also be
expanded.
In addition, Ecolo supports the sustainability of the registration fee freeze beyond the year
Education 2014 - 2015, in the logic of the International Covenant on Economic,
social and cultural.
In addition, study grants should be revalued and cover a larger number
students. Scholarships may only be conditioned by socio-economic criteria (taking into account all revenues) rather académiques31.
Finally, it is most suitable to amplify the policies developed to fight against failure within
our universities, colleges and schools artistique32.

30

This is the minimum participation rate of students in a class required for the organization of activities
external to the school and expatriation classes and discovery.
31
The current legislation continues to exclude from scholarships, students who missed more than once in his
curriculum.

Proposal: To fight against excessive debt and strengthen debt mediation
The causes of the phenomenon of over-indebtedness are often complex and multiple; they can
the result of an "accident of life" or improper assessment of capacity
refund. A problem rarely comes alone, people who have difficulty
refund can then enter an endless cycle with the accumulation of debts. The fight
against excessive debt, also closely linked to broader issues of
poverty and exclusion, has several components: prevention, information, legal aid,
definition of standards designed to ensure consumer protection, etc. It also involves the
training of people at risk in order to induce a real change in habits

Ecolo offers:

Facilitate access to justice for disadvantaged people by strengthening legal aid and
improving access to legal information so that everyone can control his rights and

Ensure stable funding of debt mediation services to expand and
multiply the educational activities related to the problem of over-indebtedness;
Furthermore, ensuring an analysis of the evolution of collective settlement procedures
debts, before the Courts of Labour, through casualization produced by
austerity measures. The shift of unemployment benefits to welfare will reduce
the purchasing power of people, will modify their budget and their ability to pay
recurring bills that we all have in our daily lives. Having oriented focus
to the Labour Tribunals in times of crisis is important to measure the oppression
on family budgets and their entry into precariousness.

PRIORITY 5: COMBAT BIG INSECURITY IN WITH A VISION
LONG TERM

Proposal: Ending homelessness
Homelessness is one of the visible faces of precariousness. It is sometimes accompanied by other
problems associated with problem drinking, drugs or mental health
and affects more and more families and also women. The policies of austerity
Federal government favored the resurgence of homelessness.
For Ecolo, beyond emergency measures in response to homelessness and actions under the
field of humanitarian, multiple solutions, and structural details must be put
effort to solve this problem. In this context, coordination of the various actors
course is essential.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter FIGHT AGAINST INSECURITY - p 20/24

Rely on accurate data to guide policies against homelessness
In Belgium, there are no official figures on the number of homeless since
the number of homeless is not the census object. Some associations
estimate that figure to 17,000 people in our country. In the Brussels Region, on the initiative of the
Minister of social action, there is an assessment of how many people from homeless two
years. This collection of data is essential to guide future policy and should be
widespread.
Create a regional public device sheltering
This device is based on the principle of vulnerability of homeless people. In this framework,
is to pool objectives and efforts to strengthen networking and articulation
activities of the different actors in the fight against homelessness. The objectives of a
Such a device is to ensure multidisciplinary support, that goes to housing
medical assistance, social ... tailored for each homeless person, reduce
financial, physical and psychological costs of the device to the thermometer (winter equipment) as
it exists and that leads to a dead end (so that no one should use an indefinitely
emergency accommodation but everyone finds a structural solution).
Answers for everyone, social urgency sustainable solutions
If the problem of homelessness called structural solutions and can qu'Ecolo
consider it from the angle of social emergency, this must be understood, however,
especially in winter. Thus, to secure associations and social workers and
ensure an indispensable device to host homeless people during the winter, the
perpetuation of the cold weather maps budget in Wallonia, like Brussels, is a prerequisite.
Their annual adoption in fact leaves the field players in uncertainty as to the organization
devices during the following winter.
But no one living in emergency housing once the emergency is over.
Indeed, beyond the emergency, the fight against homelessness called a set of answers
Ecolo join the proposals in the fight against poverty and answers
specific, such as, for example, support and the guarantee of housing for
Persons wishing institution during an outing. These responses should certainly
emerge from a coordination of all sectors involved in the fight against homelessness and taking into account the specificities and the multidimensional nature of the problems
faced by homeless people.
Ensuring access to housing and support in housing
Homelessness refers more broadly to the issue of access to decent housing for
a decent price. It is therefore appropriate to continue the policies access to housing in
financial conditions available to the lowest income and to end deportations
Winter in private dwellings.
But access to housing is sometimes not enough. To avoid that some people lose their
housing, because they suffer from various mental health problems, addictions, because
they have developed habits in the streets or face difficulties in
management of their budget or are in debt, it is also necessary to ensure their accompaniment
within the housing.

Proposal: strengthen the fight against social isolation
Both cause and consequence of insecurity and poverty, social isolation impact
seriously people's lives. Ecolo offers support and develop initiatives and places
meetings and various activities (discussion groups, leisure activities ...) which allow
rebuilding social bonds, to re-socialize, to show solidarity, share. These are

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter FIGHT AGAINST INSECURITY - p 21/24

spaces that everyone can appropriate. The word of these users may also emerge in these
places and contribute to the consideration of their situation and their opinion.

Proposal: To coordinate, support and strengthen the fieldwork
The CPAS, if they are the key players in support of people living in social distress,
alone can not cover the necessary solidarity field. Coordination and
coherence of the various players involved (public or private) as well as listening and
participation of people in need, participate in the implementation of a coherent policy
and the fight against global poverty.
Despite the considerable efforts made, this coordination has not yet become a reflex, or
at the institutional level or at the level of social field workers. Thus, the CPAS for example,
have, most often due to lack of personnel, little time to work with other actors.
The poorest people are then forced to increase the support requests
and unveilings of their living conditions, which is not a guarantee of autonomy and dignity.
But when the collaborations are in place, they are naturally in favor of
beneficiaries (access to culture funds, making employment in the private sector ...).
In terms of integration work against most vulnerable, Ecolo welcomes the work of social Relais
(bringing together public and private social workers and initiated in 2003 at the instigation of Ecolo) in
Wallonia, and health networks in Brussels. In this context, it is essential to
develop ever approach more focused on the individual than on institutions. Ecolo
also proposes that the vécu33 experts project developed by the FPS Social Integration is
analyzed and optionally expanded.
The Social Cohesion Plan of Wallonia, it is not intended that the issues of poverty, is a
initiative to improve. It is indeed high time to develop cross within
various regional skills (employment, training, social economy, the fight against
substance abuse, elderly, people of foreign origin, social inclusion ...) and work
by areas and municipalities in all of these skills in a logical
territorial. At the Brussels Region, the Brussels Plan against poverty launched
Ecolo convinced by the various political bodies in Brussels to join forces in a plane
common. Unlike past actions, the plan involves a consultation of all stakeholders
policies on all matters they handle. From this consultation arise as capital gain and the whole point of this action. Such dynamics must be pursued.
Finally, the work on indicators for choosing the priority actions must objectively
be strengthened.

33

The experience experts are citizens having experienced problems of poverty, insecurity and working within
federal government to bring their expertise and improve the consideration of the realities of life
precarious people.

HEALTH
Sustainable and accessible health
Status and political horizon
State of play
Our health system is part of a social security model guarantor of the principles of
solidarity and equity, which are reflected in the insurance each and every one vis-à-vis
disease and disability. This social and societal model calls for substantial reinforcements
to ensure, in the coming decades, quality care provision, diverse and accessible
all. In this context, the challenges are daunting.
Demographic trends are to be considered in their multiple facets: the
Population growth and aging of the population pose the questions of the social role
seniors and new requirements to help ensure a quality of life.
The economic crisis we are impoverished people in vulnerable situations and
limit its ability to access health care. Thus, despite the quality of our system
health, it is not distributed fairly, the important remaining differences between health
the citizens. The crisis also led States to significant budgetary restrictions, with some
consequences for their contribution to social policies and therefore to health care. A
evolution that already suggests a risk of privatization and commodification of the system.
Other factors also influence our health care system and its financing:
The development of technology and the increasing consumption of certain
medicines and medical procedures generate a constant increase in expenditure,
particularly in the specialized sector;
Inadequate valuation of general medicine and outpatient sector as a
together led to its unattractive; aging GPs
and the lack of new candidates violate community care;
The way hospitals are funded promotes overconsumption of technical acts
and retrocession fees in hospital pushes towards specialists
private practices and better pay, at the expense of care accessible to all
and all in hospitals;
In Belgium, the organization of budgets has replaced a phased planning
"Care lines" and created a logic built around hospitals, to the detriment
a comprehensive approach to health including prevention and community care.
The hospital institution is however also facing difficulties, she sees
constraint to reduce the length of hospital stays, while the means are
insufficient to ensure continuity of medical and paramedical care, and for
complete these by home health aides;
Institutionally, the distribution of health and social skills on all levels
power has gradually fragmented management and has made policy coherence and
more random operational.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter HEALTH - p 1/28

These various developments and the organization of our health care has resulted, firstly,
make more difficult a global, transversal approach to patients and, secondly,
to complicate the understanding and control by the users themselves in their system
health care and interventions available to them. Or health policy, to be
effective, can not be reduced to the absence of disease. It must include all sectors (promotion
health, prevention, care, etc.) and all socio-economic,
environmental, of logement1, etc. in order to understand the patient as a whole.
The health of a population is the quality of its health system to about 30%, but
lifestyles and social environment for more than 60% 2.

The political horizon of health Ecolo
Health is a major concern of Belges3. Ensuring affordability and
physics to quality care and put in place an effective system of prevention, must be a
political concern of the highest order. It is primarily through enhanced security and sociale4
will be tightened with a mesh that solidarity should be organized.
For Ecolo in this system of solidarity and social justice, social inequalities in health
must disappear. Health is a resource, an energy allowing everyone to play a part
his life and in society.
Ecolo has always defended the rights of people with low incomes and people with
chronic diseases or long-term. The public should receive care and accessible
tailored to their specific needs.
Every citizen and every citizen must also have access to health behaviors.
Thus, quality nutrition, stress management, the practice of regular physical activity,
quality housing, etc. are among the determinants of health. So many factors
where action is needed to improve the health of the Belgians, to prevent disease and, consequently,
reduce collective costs of our health care system. Thus, before which restores
health, Ecolo is guided by prospects that promote health and therefore influence
positive lifestyles, environments and social conditions.
Besides access to care and priority to health prevention, the organization of health care must
be structured around an adequate presence of health actors and in order to bring
priority responses to patient needs. The establishment of a genuine policy
health must also be done in consultation with all health actors.
Finally, the sixth state reform has also strengthened the skills of the federated entities
health. This transfer must be the opportunity for improved efficiency and
consistency of our health policy, particularly by anchoring the further promotion of health
and prevention at the heart of the system, taking into account the transfer of the exercise of that jurisdiction
the Federation Wallonia-Brussels to Wallonia and from Brussels and joints with
Other regional expertise (environment, housing, social cohesion ...).

The Ecolo force lines
For Ecolo, health policies that emphasize a healthy life should weigh on
following parameters:
Ensuring affordability of patients

Priorities and policy proposals
PRIORITY 1: ENSURE PATIENT FINANCIAL ACCESSIBLILITE
Accessibility to health care depends on both adequate provision of care and the ability to
ensure financial support for care.
Ecolo has always defended the rights of people with low incomes and those whose
Health requires many expensive services to benefit from preferential rates and
refunds strengthened. Important steps remain to be taken.

Proposal: To grant the Omnio status automatically,
without complex formality required
For Ecolo, since a person's income is below € 1,330 5, the Omnio status must
be automatically granted. The person should therefore no longer apply as is
currently the case.
Ecolo proposes the creation of an Omnio system more widely available, including workers
"Poor" and a + Omnio system for families living situations of poverty the
heavier. A household whose income would fall below the ceiling, would be granted
Omnio the preferential status automatically for a period of two years.

Proposal: Increase the rate of reimbursement of general medicine
for the insured with low income
Ecolo proposes to increase the repayment of the consultation of the general practitioner of 95 to
100% for persons under the statutes and Omnio Omnio +. Number of currently
people in precarious situations prefer to go to the hospital rather than to the GP,
because they do not have sufficient cash to pay for a consultation and the
Hospital billing is itself delayed. This can lead to unnecessary spending
in terms of additional tests and hospitalization, and represents a cost to the patient
as for health insurance. Besides the patient's risk of debt.

Omnio status is granted to households (National Register on 01 January of the year of application) whose
annual taxable gross income for the year preceding the application is less than 16 € 306.71. This amount is increased
3 € 018.84 per additional person in the household.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter HEALTH - p 3/28

Such a device requires warranty for GPs that will ensure the mutual
financing of benefits and guarantees for the health budget as doctors presteront
not unduly with these patients. Cap mechanisms by provider
may be organized for this purpose.

Proposal: Make more transparent tariffs
Following a legislative proposal environmentalists, the federal parliament recently registered in the
law the requirement for any provider to display in his waiting room and waiting rooms
hospital consultations if it is subsidized or not. Ecolo wants to go further by requiring
care providers to post their rates for the most common benefits.
Moreover, the obligation to provide any hospital before hospitalization all information
patients need regarding fares, refunds and fees are not covered
still not properly respected in too many hospitals. The law of
various provisions of December 2013 goes in the right direction but the implementation of this system
transparency of tariffs should be accelerated. Respect for patient information should be
a weight criterion in assessing the quality of a hospital and therefore in its funding.

Proposal: Reduce drug prices
Ecolo proposes to strengthen the regulation of prices for medicinal products, including the
"Submarket" generics by acting on three levels:
develop packaging adapted to the durations of treatment and up
to the single-dose prescription, to avoid unnecessary purchase excessive quantities;
gradually extend the mechanisms of the type "Kiwi" for the regulation of prices
tender;
pursue policies to encourage the use of generic drugs.

Proposal: Improve the reimbursement of consultations
in dentistry and physiotherapy
Dental care is recognized as essential to prevent many problems
health, as well as consultations with physiotherapists or osteopaths are likely to
avoid over-medication or even surgery. It is therefore important
provided that the reimbursement of these benefits be strengthened. It will result in more division
Balanced care budgets within the budget of the INAMI.

PRIORITY 2: DEVELOPING AN INTEGRATED HEALTH POLICY
Article 168 of the Treaty of Rome states that "a high level of
protection of human health should be ensured in the definition and implementation of all
Community policies and activities ".
To do this, it is necessary to develop an integrated approach to health to allow
every citizen to live healthy. While health is not just the absence of

care.












health.

The Observatory must now unite all provincial observatories that collect and
address data specific to their territory by observation modes collection
data classification and correlating with socio-economic data to them
are clean. These observatories are to become the antennas of a health area (see priority
5) and rely on the umbrella organizations of local actors in the field (eg
social intermediaries, associations of general practitioners, mental health platforms, the
patient associations, etc.), essential partners to give meaning to data
collected. Similarly the Brussels Observatory should remain competent throughout the
territory of the Region and continue to rely on local actors.

Proposal: List health in sustainable development plans and
study the impact of different public health policies
The potential influence policy (mobility, social, environmental, etc.) on health,
prevention or disease development is not taken into account at the present time.
Recent initiatives in favor of a more integrated approach to health in development
Sustainable taken. And several European governments and organizations
international such as WHO have impact assessments on health a priority. Ecolo has
also initiated work in this direction, the Parliament of the Wallonia-Brussels, aimed at
creation of a School of Public Health.
Such impact assessments are part of a combination of procedures, methods and tools
to assess the likely effects of a policy, program or project on
health of the population and the distribution of those effects within the population. For Ecolo, the
generalization of these studies should help to limit the negative impact of certain policies
Health and guide decision favorable to interventions.
Furthermore, in a sustainable development perspective, health is an objective, but also
an indispensable prerequisite. This is to provide the people a physical and moral well-being
satisfactory and to guarantee sanitary conditions for them to contribute to
development of their society. This is why sustainable development plans, both regional
and federal, should integrate the issue of public health as a transverse axis.

PRIORITY 3: TAKING ACTION ON HEALTH DETERMINANTS
Social living conditions, economic, environmental and cultural influence all
one way or another, the health of the citizens, their ability to live

That is why in particular it is appropriate to incorporate the inclusion of all of these
determinants in the initial training of health professionals training that can not be

Proposal: Breaking the link between insecurity and poor health
After age, the first determinant of health is sociale6 condition. Indeed the people
low incomes tend to push their health care and also many of them
have poor health. A vicious circle is thus established, since people
suffering or sick are also likely to experience problems on the market
work.
Ecolo proposes to act at several levels to break this link. It should first be strengthened
the health education policies. It should also reconsider the conditions of work,
Professional golf developments and accompaniments of unemployed people in
emancipatory and inclusive vision. In the fight against insecurity, Ecolo offers
including raising the minimum social benefits and at the poverty line

Finally, it is through federal legislation, to harmonize the procedures for reimbursement of expenses

Proposal: Further improve the quality of logements9
Housing quality strongly influences the lives of people and therefore life
healthy. It affects both mental and physical health: providing shelter, enjoy
intimacy, well-being in its housing is important and contributes to society. This is
Therefore, to ensure decent housing, beginning with public housing, it should:

PRIORITY 4: INVEST IN THE PREVENTION AND "RISK REDUCTION"
The use of health care, social cost and human cost to individuals, could
be greatly reduced if investments were made in the promotion of health and
in prevention. Ecolo therefore proposes that the financing of health policy is more
balanced between care policies, on the one hand and promotion and prevention, on the other.
Moreover, prevention, within an integrated and comprehensive health system must become, alongside
the curative axis, a key focus of health policy, with the contribution of all
actors to deal with the increasing costs and the increasing incidence of
preventable diseases.

Proposal: Protecting health preserving the environment
Improve and preserve the quality of the environment (air quality, water, food ...)
is a major challenge for our adult health, but more so for our children and
future generations. If significant changes have taken place in Europe, particularly at
Persistent Organic Pollutants (PoPs), sulfur, asbestos, pesticides and
water treatment, these changes are still insufficient and there are still major problems to manage
such as toxic substances in some plastics, the use of pesticides, etc.
Thus, the number of adults and children with asthma, allergies and skin diseases remains
important. For example, WHO estimates that allergy became the first chronic disease
in children in the European Union.
Ecolo offers:
At the European level :
-

to strengthen the independence of the data and studies submitted in the
risk assessment procedures and exposure to substances (substances
chemicals, pesticides, GMOs ...). The studies provided by industry tend to
minimize risk, while the current assessment methods tend
to promote industrial interests and conflicts of interest are not always
managed;

-

to studies on the medium and long term impact rather than only to
short term.

At the federal level:
-

to act on the definition, implementation and monitoring of product standards
approval marketing and use of chemicals;

-

to generalize the impact studies on the environment and health, products
chemicals, GMOs, gases and harmful particles and waves
electromagnetic;

-

necessary compensation.
At the level of the federated entities:
-

strengthen air pollution reduction rate policies,
development of transport, production of green energy,
development of more environmentally friendly agricultural sectors and
building / sustainable renovation;

-

to introduce health and environmental promotion concepts in the
basic training and continuing education for professionals (development
planning, urban planning, agriculture ...) whose activity impacts health
citizens ;

-

increase awareness of citizens, especially by supporting projects
Health promotion.

Proposal: Promoting emotional and sexual health
Generalizing education for sexual and emotional life
The generalization of education modules to the emotional and sexual life in all networks
education of Federation Wallonia-Brussels has finally gained as decretal mission
school. It is now to implement this proposal. Besides the emotional aspects and
notions of sharing and fun that should be prominent in these modules, these
latter must incorporate a psycho and biological dimension. Currently, too many
Young people still find themselves in a complex situation or take risks to their health
physical and mental because their information remains patchy. Modules must cover
comprehensive, informed and contextualised on puberty, contraception, diseases
sexually transmitted, but also early pregnancy, hommesfemmes reports and gender, identity and sexual orientation, genital mutilation,
violence, pornography ...
Relaunch of AIDS prevention campaigns and sexually transmitted infections
Despite therapeutic improvements, the risk of contracting HIV are still present,
more for gays. It is therefore essential to increase tenfold prevention efforts face struggling
risk, but also the accompanying missions, care and treatment when the disease
settles. Ecolo asks that means be again attributed to large campaigns
AIDS prevention, to the attention of a wide audience. We must fight the trivialization of AIDS,
especially among young people. Ecolo also intends to invest in anonymous testing structures
Free and facilitating access of young people, migrants and precarious populations
screening. At the same time, we must develop information related to other STDs
(syphilis, hepatitis, chlamydia ...) whose cases have a strong upward trend after
a net decrease in the 80s and 90s. Furthermore, special attention in the
Investigation of risk transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and
in prevention campaigns should be directed towards lesbians, too often forgotten
these campaigns and surveys.
Improve access to contraception for some audiences
In recent years, women under 21 years receive an intervention

Parental preclude that access to adequate contraception. Ecolo also wants to be
particular support services that work with vulnerable populations vis-à-vis
which a specific approach should be introduced, such as clandestine women,
foreign women, economically precarious populations.

Proposal: To systematize the cervical cancer screening
and breast cancer
Systematize cervical cancer screening
If substantially free vaccination against cervical cancer for girls aged
10-13 years was welcomed by many experts, the latter also
alerted about the fact that vaccines on the market only protect 70% of strains
responsible for the onset of cancer. Prevention and screening therefore remain essential,
européennes11 accordance with the recommendations. Finally, we should remain vigilant in
deployment of this policy, since the effectiveness and long-term side effects of these vaccines
are not yet known.
Prevention and screening cervical smears therefore remain essential, in line with
European recommendations.
For these materials, expertise Planned Parenthood subsidized by federal entities
should be valued and articulated with other relevant actors.
Systematize breast cancer screening
Breast cancer that affects one in ten women is one of the most important causes of
suffering and death in the European Union. As WHO reveals, breast cancer is the
first cancer in women and contributes to 28% of the total number of cancer cases in Europe. Yes
screening for women 50 to 69 years is now the subject of a free program
Belgium, the participation rate is still insufficient. Therefore proposes to strengthen and Ecolo
improve awareness campaigns among the population about the importance of screening
in order to optimize the coverage of the target population and to offer women information
objective and comprehensible information on breast cancer. It should also conduct campaigns
information from health professionals to get a larger membership
program and to consider how to pay more attention in the context of
Initial training of doctors, public health and collective preventive medicine.

Proposal: Rethink and adjust vaccine policy
Vaccination policy should be double careful. On the one hand, public authorities
must ensure effective vaccination policy in a critical and responsible spirit. Else
First, the quality and independence of scientific information must be improved
continuously.
It is in this context qu'Ecolo defends immunization policy for coverage
Optimal exposed population.
To do this, Ecolo entend12:

Continue the comprehensive reflection on vaccination in host communities initiated by the
Government of the Federation Wallonia-Brussels, in a health concern for each

Proposal: Reduce the problematic use of alcohol, tobacco,
drugs and other drugs
In all societies, in all ages, man has tested and consumed products,
despite bans or prohibitions, looking for a fun, a different sensory condition,
forgetfulness, exceeded its limits. Some products, although licit (alcohol, drugs,
tobacco ...) can cause problems, including that of addiction. Phenomenons
excessive uses of products continue to grow and can change shape.
Ecolo intends minimize the problematic use of psychotropic products. But
Prohibition is certainly not the best strategy to achieve this. For Ecolo, it is important
develop in parallel three essential policies:
enhanced repression of trafficking, drug dealers and money laundering: competence
under the Police and Justice;
prevention, through a thoroughly participatory approach for youth
especially, but also asking adults: parents, teachers, field workers;
Risk Reduction: inform consumers of the risks it poses to its
health without moralism but by renewing the link and giving it the means to preserve
his health. It is important that the consumer, if necessary, ensure the quality of
substances to hydrate properly, do not drive, do not share syringes,
etc. Risk reduction allows contact with the user and referral to
specialist support services to those who request it. It also allows
better knowledge of the products circulating, their identification and adoption of
appropriate measures in the event of discovery of deadly substances in circulation. In this
sense, it is also important to support locally innovative experiences that have shown
clearly their effectiveness, such as syringe exchange counters or terminals
eg exchange equipment.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter HEALTH - p 10/28

Fight against smoking
Ecolo endorsed the 2002 Montreal Declaration on Control and tabac13
particularly the fact that "governments must urgently establish a
effective set of measures, including regulatory and tax-backed financing
public to control the tobacco epidemic and its effects. "
To implement this action, Ecolo offers include:
to continue the implementation of the recommendations of the WHO Framework Convention;
to increase the resources made available to the public funding of tobacco prevention;
keep prevention in the lap of public authorities and to strengthen
particularly in schools, through health promotion programs built
Association between management, teachers and students;
to maintain the prohibition of advertising and sponsorship of events (or
sponsorship) ;
strengthen the tobacco control in public places and cafes to protect
Non-Smoking any smoke exposure;
to support general practitioners working in the accompanying patients;
to generalize the reimbursement of cessation assistance products;
improve accessibility for youth cessation aid structures such centers
aid to smoking;
expand the possibilities of smoking cessation training and assure them in training
Initial health professionals;
to make tobacco less accessible prices a deterrent and fighting effectively against
smuggling.
Prevent damage caused by alcohol, particularly among young
Alcohol consumption among adolescents has increased significantly in recent years. Number of studies
Epidemiological have shown growing and troubling extent of "binge
drinking ". Others highlighted the consequences of alcoholism in young short
(risk behaviors, including driving, sex or
violence), medium (attention disorders, memory and concentration) and long term
(social isolation, depression and potential entry into chronic alcoholism).
If alcohol is associated with celebration and conviviality, the fact remains that it is appropriate to
think about the use that can be made:
informing of the risks of excessive consumption and conscientization face
alcooliers business practices;
by countering the overvaluation of alcohol in our society;
clarifying the legislation on alcohol sales to minors;
by delivering specific information and health promotion programs,
especially young people and those around them (parents, teachers,
educators ...).

Develop a coherent and clear policy on cannabis
The issue of cannabis use has been addressed by the legislature in 2001, but the
Then vague decisions have hardly lit the situation. Its consumption is prohibited
minors but reality shows that the ban is widely overridden.
The issue of regulation of production and distribution should remain within the framework
a voluntary and responsible policy of harm reduction. Regulating means control
and not promote.
Thus, for public health reasons (there is currently no possibility of control
product quality, which opens the door to real dangers facing adulterated products) and order
public (consumers must provide to clandestine and illegal channels, which
increases the risk of being offered the most dangerous products), Ecolo considers it
better that the government support the regulation and control of trade
cannabis, as for alcohol and tobacco.
Regarding tobacco, the regulation and control enabled, after years of effort,
decrease in the overall tobacco consumption, in particular due to regulations more
increasingly strict (smoking ban in public places, at school, at work, in the catering industry ...).
Fight against addictions related to heroin, cocaine and their derivatives
Ecolo joined the recommendations of the Drugs Action Plan européen14 and offers:
strengthen repression against the production and trafficking at the national and
European ;
to reduce demand through education and prevention actions (in
especially against young people), but also thanks to the assistance offered to users and

risk reduction actions on the ground, where the users are;
to support, at the federal level, the development of alternative treatments
heroin and pilot projects for controlled distribution of heroin that could lift
certain consumer delinquency and improve their health.

Proposal: Preventing suicide, do not accept as inevitable
The vagaries of life sometimes cause personal choice to end life, a choice that
requires no judgment, but the reasons can not be seen as inevitable. There
situation of suffering actual or perceived before passing the act must be apprehended.
The figures, even if they are undervalued since the suicide attempts and suicides all
are not recorded as such (and many suicides by road for example spend
unnoticed), demonstrate that this is a major public health problem.
Moreover, a phenomenon about which little is the increase in the number of suicides
Seniors. The factors involved are often health problems, the transition to
institutional living, the loss of an intimate relationship, socio-economic problems or
abuse.
Given these facts, prevention strategies must be questioned. Further actions
targeted prevention general must be developed through health policies, but also
transversely through the housing, social assistance, etc. Prevention also requires the
redeployment of a social climate of solidarity and interpersonal recognition.

Coordinate policies and suicide prevention initiatives
Prevention should be strengthened within the organized sectors such as education, aid to
Youth and care of the elderly.
Thus, it is appropriate to generalize the training seminars on risk behavior of
teenager (s) to the attention of workers of PES services (Health promotion in schools), the
services of the youth assistance and teachers.
Training and awareness must also be accessible for all professionals
Health and social accompanying the elderly in institutions and at home,
particularly for GPs, any frontline actors to make
able to detect the warning signs of suicide.
Finally, the networking of the sectors involved in suicide prevention is essential.
Support people in difficulty and their families
The capacity of specialized structures should be increased, new mobile teams
specialized psychological intervention must be created and collaborations with services
enhanced mental health, to provide support tailored to the individual but also to
the entourage. Among young people, the psychological impact and the risk of "contamination", pushing
a classmate to pass the act, are not negligible. This is why the resources allocated to
health promotion programs must be scaled up to enable the
strengthening intervention teams at a school after a suicide.
Physically prevent suicide
The analyzes demonstrate the deterrent effect of physical protection installed in places where a
suicidal impulse can be achieved. It is important, as far as possible and where the
suicides were observed, install guards along the high bridges and certain roads
railway for example.

PRIORITY 5: PROMOTING HEALTH IN DIFFERENT LIVING ENVIRONMENTS
PEOPLE

Proposal: To promote health at work
Policy developments in competitiveness and flexibility has contributed to the precarious market
work, with a significant impact on the health and welfare of workers. Stress,
burnout, mental health or back problems are becoming more common.
If their consequences go far beyond the field of occupational medicine, it is important that it
is more concerned with the welfare to work and plays a role interpellation interlocutors
Social and governments.
In Belgium, the Law of 4 August 1996 on welfare of workers in the framework of the execution
their work is the cornerstone of the legislation on safety and health
work.
Any employer has the obligation to promote the well-being in his company by the bais of a
risk prevention policy, the implementation of individual and collective means of
protection and training and information for workers.
The number of workers in the control cells under that Act is insufficient. Of
Moreover, if these doctors have long followed a specialized training in occupational medicine, their
recognition remains low. The means available are too outdated to enter
effectively connected with workers, check the locations and working conditions and assess

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter HEALTH - p 13/28

the impact of organizational modes on the welfare of workers. Thus, medical visits
often limited to quick, stereotypical meetings.
Strengthening controls has been pointed as one of the crucial aspects of the Strategy
national policy on wellbeing at work 2008-2012, presented there are already more than two years and
half. Strengthening both cash and qualitative inspection services therefore appears
paramount.
It is also important to review how medical officers fulfill their mission
support and counseling for workers unable to work, then they must also
assume the role of guarantor of control and budgets relating to disability and invalidity
workers.
It should also enable the halftime médicaux15 when possible and desired,
and participation in parallel activities, and that, by educating doctors advice
about the benefits of these activities and social links to the individual.
Finally, the criteria for well-being at work should incorporate new concepts, including
degree of time management of work by the worker, the reconciliation of that time working and
time privacy, instead of new technologies as part of that reconciliation, as well
that the quality of food in canteens and organized opportunities exercise
physical.

Proposal: Promote health to école16
The school must be a central location for developing a health-oriented lifestyle.
Besides the proposals ahead especially in terms of emotional and sexual life or
healthy eating in school canteens, we propose to continue developing
the activities of health promotion services at school (PSE) to healthy school projects.
This together with the whole school community and participation councils.
The presence of soft drinks dispensers and "junk food" in schools should be reconsidered
after a debate with all stakeholders of school life. Moreover, each school should be
equipped including drinking fountains.

Proposal: Encourage healthy neighborhoods and towns
Our cross health policy obviously articulates with the level of the most power
close to the citizen what the town. That is why we support a
Alderman cross of health in each municipality.
The federated entities must encourage joint in this direction in particular by integrating
health aspects in social cohesion plans in sustainable neighborhood projects, etc. and in
continuing to support initiatives such as eg VIASANO (support program
common in projects "eat better, move more").

Proposal: Ensure prison health
Prison health is a real public health problem that should be taken head on.
Indeed, Belgium is far from the WHO recommendations that have particular that

"All prisoners are entitled to health care, including preventive measures, without
discrimination and equivalent to those available in the community. "
Prison conditions, the significant flow of drugs without reduction policy
risk, etc. are factors that negatively affect the health of prisoners.
A priority is to benefit health care of inmates supported by the system
health care, as with any insured.
So much in prison that prisoners' health needs to be improved after their release, including
by organizing a medical examination before sortie17.

PRIORITY 6: ENCOURAGE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND HEALTHY EATING
The promotion of health must give citizens the means to improve their health and to ensure
greater control. Ecolo wants the promotion of health should be organized as soon as
young age in all reception areas, teaching and training. Indeed,
behaviors and lifestyles have a decisive influence on our health.

Proposal: To promote the movement, regular physical activity and
respect the sleep quality
Regular physical activity has very positive effects on preventing and evolution
a number of diseases. The studies show a positive effect of the activity
physics on cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, attacks System
osteoarticular, as well as the risk of some cancers. Generally at
adult, exercise reduces anxiety and emotional instability, improves mood and resistance
to stress.
Several actions can be taken to encourage regular physical activity, such as
promote travel from home to school or walk or cycle to work, or develop the
public spaces for walking, biking or sports. Moreover, awareness of sleep
of quality, restorative effects to be incorporated in awareness campaigns to activity
Regular physical.
An employer engagement could also be organized from the Federal Ministry
Employment and Welfare at work to provide time and physical activity spaces
could prevent many of the problems of the back, for example, but also to
concentration.

Proposal: Promoting access to a balanced diet quality
The link between food and health is essential. But in this area, several developments
problematic in our society: a growing obesity rates, including among young people
children; an increasing correlation between excess weight, the increase in diabetes, problems
cardiovascular and cancer development. If public health issues are
obvious, it should work on the root problem, which is access to healthy food
and quality.
Ecolo therefore proposes:
a specific public support to nurseries, schools, holiday centers, hospitals, homes,
rest homes, so they offer balanced meals, quality or from

17

For more information on the proposed Ecolo on the subject, see chapter "Justice and Prisons."

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter HEALTH - p 15/28

of organic production. These nutritional quality requirements can be integrated
to charge notebooks community kitchens. At the initiative of Children's Ministers,
youth, health and education, a special specification was
developed and made available for public canteens 3-18 years. The same work must
be led to other forms of government;
systematic education and awareness of children and families must be
organized so as to be for all, including those who do not have access
spontaneously to such information;
supervision of the advertising of food and labeling in order to
correctly identify the benefits or health risks involved in their
consumption ;
a strict limitation of fatty acids "trans" in foods, according to the recent
Report of the High Council of Health on fatty acids "trans" industrielle18 of origin.

PRIORITY 7: optimize ORGANIZATION OF HEALTH CARE
The organization of health care provision must meet the fundamental objective of guaranteeing
each and every access to quality care, a holistic approach to health through
complementarities between the different actors of health, to free choice and a special relationship
with the general practitioner, reference person.

Proposal: Organize health territories to meet the needs of
patients by a medical and complementary offer adapted
between community care and specialized care
Ecolo wishes to establish an organization of supply of healthcare by health area with
the goal of improving and specify the distribution of health actors in that territory, from a
needs assessment of their population health care.
Such an assessment must be carried by all health actors from an area
geographic, based on the existing care provision, socio-economic realities and
not encountered applications. Health territories therefore start from a needs approach
populations and should allow a transition from an institution to a logical logical service
health.
The delimitation of these areas must take account of local realities, dynamic mobility
and communication behaviors of the population to health care provision, attractiveness
structures, inequality of access and redress the geographical context or limits
administrative but not locked.
Such logic of needs assessment and offers care providers in a territory must
also go along with the deletion of the current system of numerus clausus19 and quotas
INAMI which Ecolo has always opposé20.

18

The SHC recommends banning the sale of food containing more than two grams of industrial AGT 100
grams of oil or fat. In the previous legislature, Ecolo had already filed a bill to
request limiting trans fatty acids. After other states or countries outside the EU, Denmark has taken the initiative to
limit by law the intake of trans fatty acids to a maximum of 2%.
19
For more information on the proposed Ecolo on this, see Chapter "Higher Education".
20
Ecolo offers fully replace the INAMI quota mechanism by developing a decentralized system
regulation of the medical offer based on assessed and organized by basins care needs. The offer must indeed
meet local requirements definition and physicians based on a facilities planning; in particular, there
necessary to foster facilities where physician shortages and to avoid the arrival of doctors where supply is already

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter HEALTH - p 16/28

In such a health perspective territories, public and non-public hospitals will
also work together in the overarching objective of meeting the needs of the
population without competition or duplication in the development of specialized services or
expensive technical equipment. It is the same for the non-hospital sector,
ambulatory, private or subsidized, for general or semiskilled.
In this configuration, it is also necessary to redefine the tasks of the different providers
care and ensure the best possible complementarity. Doctors and nurses are faced
in funded acts inappropriately, pushing overconsumption of certain acts and
specializations that divert outpatient care and overall patient approach
qu'Ecolo hear back.
Finally, opening, transfer and merger of pharmacies open to the public must
also be designed so as to ensure their geographical or demographic distribution.
Ecolo offers an incentive system, the image Impulseo21 general medicine, is in
place so that new pharmacies are implanted where the needs are recognized. The adoption of a
new remuneration system for pharmacists and redefining their role in the
notably through the official recognition of pharmaceutical care, is a first step
towards strengthening the role of the pharmacist as a local player.

Proposal: Reforming the decision-making system
For Ecolo, health policies must be developed in consultation with all
actors. However, the current system is based on a strong focus on hospitals policies and
specialized care. The predominant representation of specialists and hospitals in
main consultation structures such as mutual medical board or the principal
Notice of pending public health (National Council of Hospital Establishments, CNEH), makes
difficult to develop a truly global health policy patient-centered and
primary care.
The same arises regarding the National Council of Nursing Practitioners who account
no nurse or nurse with a home practice. Following the recent reform of
Council seats are now guaranteed for specialized hospital nurses, but not
for nursing home.
Ecolo proposes to make an assessment of the current system and a rebalancing of
representation of first and second line treatments in various forums
BI and opinions.
Moreover, Ecolo wants to open decision-making systems of health user participation.
In this context, public funding for patient organizations so that they must be insured
can organize and have the means to fulfill this mission without relying on firms or
private foundations. After an optimal consultation with all stakeholders, the final decision
organization of public health policy returns to the public authority that assumes
responsibility and funding.

Proposal: Strengthen and structure the Primary Care home
Ecolo proposes to develop the supply of care in the homes of beneficiaries and to involve all
players in the sector, such as nursing home care and allied health
as physiotherapists and nursing-es aid.

exceeds the needs. Several bills have been filed in this regard by Ecolo. To learn more about
Ecolo proposals on this, see Chapter "Higher Education".
21
Impulseo aims inter alia to encourage the installation of GPs in areas with shortages, via
financial incentives.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter HEALTH - p 17/28

A valuation of community care involves a combination of structures and services
hospital as well as rest and care homes (MRS) and rehabilitation services so
to ensure continuity of care between health care settings and home. This link is all the more
important that the length of stay is increasingly reduced.
Coordination of support services in the home and local social services is also
essential to ensure quality of life and care for the isolated, impoverished or
dependent family during periods of convalescence.
In this context, a one-time offer or home during the day should also be set up
to avoid repetitive re-hospitalizations.
For Ecolo, should:
structure the frontline territory by health care;
support multidisciplinary practices including health and psychosocial professions like the family planning clinics or medical centers involving doctors
and social workers, for example;
to consider the organization of care and home support workers in the territory in
management and organization of care in hospitals;
to redefine, in terms of cultural evolution, social and demographic, the role and
Missions of the various stakeholders of outpatient (home nurse, doctor
generalist, etc.) and their relation to accommodation facilities and hospitalization;
strengthen primary care facilities such as medical homes,
Nursing places nearby and the collective guard posts, with
centralization of calls to directly refer patients to emergencies,
the guard or GP.

Proposal: Review the role and hospital funding
The hospital must continue to play an important role in the organization of health care
quality accessible. Its financing and operation must be, however,
fundamentally revised.
Ecolo defended as such the organization and regulation of the provision of care based on territories
Health and based on the principle of subsidiarité22. Preferred procedures are those of
GPs supplemented, where necessary, by those of specialists and / or structures
hospital.
Thus, the hospital and experts must be involved in the patient's care pathway when
it needs technical procedures or specific interventions, or a stay care
complex. Each hospital must be able to offer specialized quality care, but
proper organization among hospital structures must allow some hospitals to
specialize in technical and sharp and expensive treatments.
In this context, intends Ecolo generalize lump hospital funding (a package for
infrastructure and equipment; a package to finance the administrative and
paramedics; a package to finance the doctors). Funding to the act of hospitals and
retrocessions demanded by the vis-à-vis hospitals for these providers to the act cause
surprestations of the highest paid acts by INAMI and inequality in the distribution
technical and human resources between hospital.

22

The responsibility of public action, when necessary, must be allocated to the smallest entity capable of
solve the problem by itself. When problems exceed the capabilities of a small entity, has the higher level
then the duty to support, within the limits of subsidiarity.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter HEALTH - p 18/28

The financing of medical specialists should be organized about it based on the number of
patients and care pathways (which characterize the overall treatment of diseases which are
with patients). This lump financing method that distinguishes the technical budgets,
medical, paramedical and administrative staff but also by lump
"Types" of patients, so just would reward hospitals and would end their need
to require reimbursements to physicians based on the acts they prestent. This reintroduce
secondly greater collegiality among practitioners in the same hospital.
Following numerous meetings of managers and clinicians, proposes that Ecolo
they are paid on the basis of a scale specialist, regardless of their discipline.
These rates may be increased on the basis of objective criteria relating to the hardship, the guards,
the extent of service training, or research for doctors in hospitals
academics.
The objectives of this proposal are twofold. First, it is to end
overuse of technical acts, the exodus of specialists to firms and privés23
tensions that exist within hospitals between specialists of different disciplines.
On the other hand, this is to allow review of nomenclature, that is to say the amount of
estimated refund for different medical procedures posed. The classification of acts and
their estimated cost today completely deconstructs the quality of care provision. Why
Indeed, she is reading an x-ray, for example, so that the best paid
consultation of an infant by a pediatrician?
Finally, the quality criteria considered for hospital funding should incorporate a
test for collaboration between hospitals, GPs and care providers
home. The hospital must therefore be part of the patient care pathway, complementing
with close to primary care. Similarly, the quality criteria are also
integrate the provision of medical record information on file sharing service
global and computerized medical patients, in relation to the general practitioner. This folder
medical shared gathers in fact, thanks to computers, all the services provided by
the various stakeholders of the hospital the doctor from the same patient.

Proposal: Develop an integrated mental health policy
In 2005, the WHO Framework, Belgium signed the Helsinki Declaration which commits states to
reduce the number of psychiatric beds to devote more resources to the accompaniment of
people with mental health problems in their living environment.
In this respect, Belgium has implemented the so-called Reformation 107, the principle, namely
reduce the number of hospital beds for the benefit of an environment in work and / or housing
protected, is welcome. However, this reform is, as is, prisoner hospital model
dominant. Indeed, funding and development of living environment are alternatives
dependent on the initiative of hospitals whose staff is assigned to outpatient teams without
however, benefit from the necessary framework to these new practices.
For Ecolo, it is therefore essential during the development of services and ambulatory care
is independent of the hospital institutions. A mandatory phase conversion
a greater number of hospital beds into new support structures and
accommodation must also take place. If hospitals are necessary structures and relays
complementing the open and protected dwellings based services, the hospital can not be
the first element organizing the distribution of resources.

23

It should prevent the escape of hospital specialists. Their dispersion indeed accentuates the appeal of these patients
specialists for situations often under general medicine. This generates significant additional costs borne by the
patients and social security but also significant shortages in some hospitals and therefore situations
competition between hospitals.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter HEALTH - p 19/28

It is from mental health services and first line (generalists houses
medical ...) that the ambulatory support teams should be set up. A
care provision, which must also be structured on a territorial basis to define
responsibilities and complementarities.
Moreover, out of hospital crisis home beds to be created, both in the Brussels Region

in Wallonia, to manage crises when maintaining the living environment is no longer possible.
Finally, many psychiatric hospitals experiencing delays in investment and development
compliance. The challenges that must be met for hospitals that remain, in
the perspective of humanization of living spaces.
New protected dwellings
Protected dwellings represent a key link between accommodation and autonomy,
registering the patient in the social fabric, but in an environment-institutionalized
reassuring. Despite the definition of a federal legal framework and funding via the RIZIV and FPS
Health, the sector still suffers from underfunding. There is also little support in Wallonia
while the Flemish and Brussels regions contribute to the construction or renovation costs
buildings. Ecolo wants Wallonia engages in this direction.
Protected dwellings resulting mostly from the conversion of psychiatric beds after
mandatory conversion policy in the 90s. The seats come today
miss while these are hospitals that have the power to decide on the conversion.
Ecolo therefore proposes to make a new mandatory conversion phase based on a
assessment of local needs.
Support the assistance and the meeting between peers
The venues for meetings and various activities (support groups, recreational activities ...) allow
psychiatric patients to re-socialize and rebuild a life project. These are
spaces they can appropriate where allay their fears and fight against loneliness. The speech
of these users may also emerge in these areas and contribute to the quality improvement
services.
Facilitate access to mental health care
In general, mental health care remains inaccessible to many
people. Currently, health insurance supports the benefits of
psychiatrists. Furthermore, the federated entities, in charge of mental health centers, can not
cope with the increasing needs. Mental health care should therefore be taken into
over by the federal health insurance, as well as other types of care.
The recognition of psychotherapists is also a condition of access to health care and
to the accompaniment of patients.
Finally, the increasing difficulties in the labor market (stress or discomfort that increasingly live
more workers) must be taken into account by the occupational medicine.
Proposal: To provide a place for complementary medicine
In 1999 the Colla Act recognized some complementary medicine like osteopathy,
homeopathy, chiropractic and acupuncture. The first royal decrees establishing the
conditions for the exercise of these practices, however, have been adopted in July 2013. Thus, for
each of these disciplines, a basic medical training, physiotherapist, wise
woman or pharmacist is required.
For Ecolo, the recognition and quality requirements of unconventional medicine
were necessary since they match care applications and are characterized by a
comprehensive, holistic approach, people and their health.
Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter HEALTH - p 20/28 However, university faculties of medicine and doctors unions continue to oppose it. The
conflict also persists between conventional medicine and complementary medicine.
For Ecolo, only an integrated approach to health can claim a positive solution where
each provider is positioned as a dynamic complement to the health service
Public. That is why the study of complementary medicine should be integrated into curricula
universities, places of meetings between allopathic and complementary medicine should be
developed and public scientific research on the subject should be supported.
Proposal: To ensure access to information in the medical record
benefit the patient
For several years, patients are encouraged to negotiate with their GP's
holding a global medical file containing medical interventions and health problems
encountered. Networks of information exchange between general practitioners, specialists,
hospitals as well as data transfer platforms are developed in parallel. Since
2013, the federated entities provide financial support and a regulatory framework for these networks
Data Exchange with respect for the privacy of patients. These networks complement the
Federal eHealth platform.
Given these positive developments, which will prevent the repetition of therapeutic procedures
useless or even dangerous diagnosis, and benefit from a vision experienced by the treatment
patient, it is important:
to ensure that shared computerized medical record is the physician service
General to enable him to have a global vision of his patients, to help them
to link different care interventions;
to ensure better involve patients and give them sufficient information their
to understand their situation. Patients should keep the right to give
or not access to their medical records;
to consider electronic medical records as an opportunity to ensure
comprehensive and transversal approach to the health of patients, provided these are
respected and involved permanently;
evaluate the access of medical records to other health care providers as no
legal provision currently oversees shared professional secrecy;
to reflect on the possibility of linking the pharmaceutical file to the folder
medical, in agreement with the patient.
PRIORITY 8: DEVELOP AND STRENGTHEN HEALTH PROFESSIONALS
Proposal: Establish schools sante24
Ecolo proposes to reorganize the initial training of health professionals by setting
up of health schools. It is to act at source to develop a health policy that
comprehensive and multidisciplinary want, from prevention to care, primary care at the
hospital.
These include guide training industry professionals to health and not
to medicine only; to build a training related to the type of service
get to the population; consider that health is the case of a multidisciplinary
24
Read the report on the reform of health studies by Mr. Jacques Morel, Ecolo Member Brussels, 2011.
Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter HEALTH - p 21/28 professionals who share their team skills. It is therefore to adapt the content and
training system to current health needs. This challenge is shared by many
health actors.
The organization of an initial core curriculum for universities and high schools concerned and
gateways allowing reorientation in the same area give a common culture and
directed to all health professionals of health professions.
Training content must integrate public health dimensions promotion
Health and multidisciplinary work that are now virtually absent. The approaches
Psychosocial should also be further developed to meet current needs.
The social responsibility of academia is to help provide training for
health professions and skills the company needs. Ecolo hope that this project opens
as soon as possible, with the participation and in consultation with the academic community.
Proposal: Enhance the intellectual act and simplify
administrative procedures
For Ecolo, it is essential to enhance the consultation with a general, called "act
intellectual ". Indeed, under pressure of a high number of daily consultations, doctors
GPs are forced to sometimes more limited to the act of prescribing to the detriment of
listening and monitoring work that the patient is the intellectual act. It should also be
think about the valuation of pharmacists who are now subject to the same constraints.
Finally, besides the valuation of the intellectual act, it should simplify procedures
administrative requirements of practitioners to enable them to devote more time
outreach and exchange with their patients.
Proposal: Making general practitioner its central role
in the health care system
The GP is often the first contact for citizens. Figure reassuring it
knows his patients, their medical history and their environment. Often real doctor
Family, he accompanied generations of patients for years.
It should go to the GP's pivotal role in the health care system, for reasons of
quality of the care process, well-being of patients and the overall saving care system.
Give more meaning and frontline of medicine force passes through:
the registration of the general practitioner as the pivot of a multidisciplinary device (care
home, social assistance, support autonomy) and of better organizational skills
suitable for professional and personal needs;
redefining and improving the relationship between the family physician and the hospital,
in a perspective of continuity (involvement at the time of inputs and outputs or even visits
the family doctor in the hospital ...)
an organization for health care providers territories to ensure their
complementarity and value, including financially for the patient, the use of
GP before specialist or hospital service;
automatic extension (administrative) of the overall medical record (DMG rest
currently valid until the end of the second calendar year following the year of inception)
to retain patients to their physician. An automatic assignment of the file
Global Medical could be offered to citizens by not yet.
Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter HEALTH - p 22/28 Proposal: Enhancing the nursing function and address the shortage
If the number of nursing students is increasing and the number of new
nurses is high, many are also those who leave the profession after
a few years of practice. In 2011, about 140 000 nurses, 105 000
plied their trade ... and while 5,000 people have graduated each year, it remained
2000 vacancies in the medical sector by the VDAB, Forem and Actiris.
It is therefore appropriate to review the working conditions and the development of the career:
Develop more mobile teams, holding the necessary qualifications
to allow the replacement of those who have to go to training or
on leave and allocate adequate budgets to continuing education nursing
to do this ;
Implementing the "tandem plan" between a novice nurse and a nurse
experienced, which reduces the working time of the elder in favor of a more
youth who would benefit from transfer of knowledge and know-how;
Inspiration from countries where the student is coached by an experienced mentor during his internship
and seek to limit the field followed by a nursing student nurse or carer
internship ;
Valuing the nursing chief function, particularly in terms of pay for the difference
nursing salary is too low compared to the responsibility assumed;
Create non-hierarchical functions rewarding (reference nurse, mentor, etc.);
Raise the basic level of training for nurses and integrate home care
basic training and internships, complementarily to hospital dimensions;
Establish high-level further training available in the
career for those who wish to progress in this discipline. Concretely,
is to give nurses the opportunity to make a "career clinic" or
to embrace new roles. That is to say, to reward the skills acquired by
experience and track ongoing training, not just those who had
the opportunity to specialize after their general studies. In the same vein, the
specializing in home care and the integration courses in services
ambulatory during basic training are thinking;
Allow access and the right to upgrade training for those who
stopped (or had to stop) their trade for many years and wish to return to
the ground while having the guarantee to always be well aware of the care developments.
Ecolo also proposes to review the distribution of acts between physicians and nurses
and their remuneration by the INAMI as nursing home care are underfunded, of
Many services provided by nurses today are not by doctors and
hospitalizations becoming increasingly shorter, nurses are asked to benefits
home more and more technical and high responsibility.
Proposal: Strengthen the role of the pharmacist as a local player
Available without appointment, the pharmacist is one of the closest health professionals
the population with the general practitioner. Often, a social bond and a relationship of trust
weave with patients, especially in neighborhood pharmacies. In complementarity with the
GP, the pharmacist is well placed to understand people in their
whole, provide personalized care and guidance counseling.
Ecolo has, in consultation with pharmacists to continue adapting their system
compensation so that they receive a fixed and independent of the number and remuneration
Ecolo 2014 program - book Social Justice - Chapter HEALTH - 23/28 percent of the cost of selling drugs. This remuneration would include consulting and
vigilance and continuing training of pharmacists.
These developments and official recognition of pharmaceutical care combine to make the
pharmacist a real player in the vicinity.
Proposal: Recognize and value the role of professionals
Mental Health
In recent decades, mental health professions have experienced very developments
important in Belgium as in all developed countries. Many people are
Today resort and this trend is increasing.
They constitute a complementary approach to conventional medical approach, not least because
they apprehend the problems of patients in terms of subjective personal experiences. They
sometimes possible to avoid the use of unwanted medical interventions and limit
use of psychotropic medications, while trying to make a better life for the patient as
his entourage.
Grant a status to these trades is twofold. On the one hand, this is to ensure that citizens
optimal quality of care by setting a clear framework for the exercise of these professions; else
First, it is about recognizing a role in the field of health for health professionals
mental, clinical psychologists and psychotherapists in doctor's side and the other
recognized professionals.
Regarding more specifically psychotherapy, Ecolo has actively participated in
the development of legislative proposals and parliamentary work to be recognized as the
psychotherapists who have undergone special training required 4 years after a training
Bac equivalent basis in psychological, medical and social and educational policies. This
psychotherapy training is required even for the person who has a Masters in
PhD in psychology or psychiatry. This basic training should have enabled the acquisition of
certain prerequisites must or, if this is not the case, be complemented by preparatory training.
A national psychothérapie25 Board will be responsible for determining these requirements, accredit
training centers specialized in psychotherapy and future psychotherapists. The
Psycho-social science research and educational organized in universities and the
Universities are considered as places of exemption from basic training for future candidates
the specific psychotherapy training.
The achievements and experiences of psychotherapists already working today will be valued
as part of this new device.
Legislation passed in February 2014 will be applicable at the latest by September 2016, the time
implement the entire device. It will follow this process because it will end soon, the sooner the
reimbursement by the INAMI of psychotherapy services can be organized and budgeted.

Committee to be linked to health policy management bodies.
Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter HEALTH - p 24/28 PRIORITY 9: BETTER INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH FOR HEALTH IN
ANY INDEPENDENCE
Proposal: Strengthen research and knowledge
on the population's health status
Develop the capacity of regional observatories and federal institutions that manage
integrated systems data
These observatories and institutes can give the political authorities a clear picture of the state of
population health, determinants of health, consumption of drugs and
the effectiveness of treatments. These institutions must work complementarily
and not concurrent.
Support epidemiological research within a European framework
Including whether to continue the analysis of the links between certain diseases and factors
environmental, labor or social. These investigations must be independent of the interests
private and therefore benefit from public funding.
Strengthen oriented public research to improve health care
It is centered on new drugs, new treatments, or it concerns
innovations in the care of patients, public research should receive more
means and private research to be better framed. It should conditioning benefits
tax and subsidies granted to researchers and the pharmaceutical industry to take into account the
societal priorities in health. Indeed, today, the pharmaceutical industry operates its
choice of research according to the market that it can touch, and not necessarily
according to the most urgent needs.
Making legitimacy to public health institutions by avoiding conflicts of interest
scientists
Following recent scandals about drugs with side effects and nocifs26
Frequently called into question the independence of expert committees, both regarding substances
dangerous to health than about drugs, it is better ensure independence
experts and the quality of the giving of notice to the political authorities procedures.
Ecolo therefore proposes to create a device that combines the harmonization of procedures
declaration of interests and regulation of conflicts of interest; this by the introduction of a register
National expertise and superior Council of expertise or equivalent but
independence is ensured, covering the skills of the FPS Health, Environment and
food chain safety.
An obligation of transparency must also be appropriate for the composition of committees
Reviews and the content of the opinions of the authorities, including minority opinions.
Finally, Ecolo calls for the results of all medical studies, not just those
giving the results "expected" and the protocols (number of subjects of the experiment, study
blind or not ...) are published.
Access to independent information for health professionals
If limits were put to the benefits that companies can provide physicians,
information given to them for medicines, risk of side effects,
26
The Mediator in France is the most telling example.
Ecolo 2014 program - book Social Justice - Chapter HEALTH - p 25/28 of changing technologies and treatments often available directly from the
industry.
Similarly, academic experts often rely on companies for their programs
research. Patient organizations are sometimes pushed their turn, by firms or
other organizations, to defend the approval or reimbursement of treatment or oppose
the development of certain therapies.
It is therefore firstly to impose full transparency of donations and funding of firms and
other organizations for health professionals, university laboratories, associations
and foundations. Secondly, it is to provide independent information to physicians
developing tools and information systems of the FPS Public Health.
The Federal Agency for Medicines must also play a role of objectification and access to
information, without any form of influence, and ensure the effective operation and
Accessibility pharmacovigilance27 systems.
PRIORITY 10: ENSURING THE RIGHTS OF PATIENTS
Proposal: To inform patients of their rights
Patients' rights are defined by law. This legislation promotes trust and quality
professional relationship between patient and practitioner. The caregiver is required to inform such
clearly his patient's state of health and care that are offered. For its part, the
patient also commits him to communicate to health care all information
for its medical management.
In practice, despite the campaign set up in December 2012 by the federal government
on the occasion of ten years of the law, these rights remain largely ignored both by the
Health professionals and patients.
Ecolo therefore proposes to enhance communication around these rights, including:
foster testimonials from people who have used mediation;
develop greater visibility of the mediators and the law in hospitals and
on their websites;
encourage participatory projects with users and with associations of
patients.
Proposal: Integrating users and patients associations
in advisory bodies
Better collaboration between the different stakeholders of health, including users,
allows a more comprehensive and realistic approach to health. The patient must be able to raise
critical questioning about how our health care system and to participate in discussions
and decisions that concern him in this area.
Moreover, for Ecolo, patient organizations should unite and be supported. Their
representation must be guarantor in consultative bodies of health policies at both
level of the federal state that the federated entities.

HOUSING
An accessible and adequate housing
Status and political horizon
State of play
The Constitution states, in Article 23, the right to housing. This right should be understood in
its broadest sense, as a real right to housing, including the quality of the living environment
and the environment. The living concept therefore covers our eyes relatively wide field,
especially as have decent housing conditions access to various basic rights, such as
right to work, health, education ....
The housing problem has different dimensions:
an economic dimension: it is necessary to shelter and heat at an affordable price;
sociocultural dimension: housing is a place of social and cultural life, anchored
in a territory, usually the neighborhood or village;
energy and environmental dimension: the quality of the habitat conditions its
energy consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases and has an impact on the
health of its inhabitants;
a qualitative dimension: the quality of buildings and the immediate environment,
such as the existence of infrastructure and local services (schools, public transport
common ...) or limitation of any nuisances (noise, fumes, carting ...);
a quantitative dimension: habitat must be adapted to the needs of households, what
their size and configuration.
The Wallonia and Brussels residential areas are mixed.
The housing stock in Wallonia is in the order of 1.6 million units, of which 480,000 are
rental housing. It is characterized by an ownership rate occupants very important and
80% of dwellings are single-family dwellings. Social housing represents 25% of
rental housing and nearly 8% of the total housing stock. 8 000 to 12 000 people live otherwise
"Permanent habitat" 1, generally in a recreation area.
In Brussels, the situation is reversed: about 63% of residents are tenants 2. The Park
housing account of the order of 570,000 units, including 50,000 public rental housing,
330 000 private rental units and 190,000 units owner occupied.
An economic and social issue
It is often said that the Belgian has a brick in the stomach, in the sense that the vast majority of
population aspires to become owner, or even build his own house. This

Wallonia now has close to 12,000 people living in recreation areas (mainly
campsites).
2
According to figures from Land Registry.
Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter ACCOMMODATION - p 1/21 situation is the result of a long tradition of acquisitive policies based on the idea that the
Housing is one of the pillars of security of existence of households. But the crisis is there and become
owner is less obvious: on the one hand, and lack of affordable housing
decent; secondly, the pauperization of the population progresses. The upward trend of
rents, decreasing household size, changes in family composition
(separation / redial), the increase in energy prices and the socioeconomic context
are structural causes of lack of access to housing. Many households
and should devote some more off their resources on housing.
Alongside this casualization of a large part of the population, property prices
undergo a bidding war for many years. In Brussels, the situation is particularly
concern: the acquisition prices have soared and home ownership is now reserved for
households that have both very comfortable income and a starting wealth (or
parental support). Consequently, many households, including in classrooms
averages, choose an exodus to areas where the acquisition is less expensive.
Concomitantly, the Brussels Region is facing a demographic boom: its population
will increase by 16% between 2010 and 2020, especially in the lower classes, which will increase
still needs affordable housing. Wallonia is, meanwhile, faces several
places the problem of high land pressure areas, which drives young couples from
raw. Moreover, Brussels and Wallonia, thousands of housing units remain unoccupied,
for a variety of reasons. Incentives and / or binding must be strengthened to
to put these homes on the market.
Rent housing is not easy. Tenants have more and more trouble finding a
quality housing appropriate to their needs and at reasonable prices. For market renters
private first victims of the lack of decent, affordable housing, the rent achieved in
35% of the average household budget, and this position is increasing for many of them.
Current rents increased by 15% between 2004 and 20113. The rental market is more
narrow part of the not found in housing demand is transferred to him. In
Consequently, poor households are penalized twice: first captives of the most segment
degraded private market, then submitted to the market, which, given the increase in
demand, is one whose prices are rising fastest.
Finally, access to adequate housing is not necessarily easy. Sociological mutation
families requires more small and large housing units than in the past. In
2012, Wallonia, single parent families represented 29.8% of the population; to
Brussels, the figure was 33.3%. There is no complacency in the marketplace, small housing
appropriate and affordable for single parents, childless couples or people
only. At the same time, large housing for families (especially families
recomposed) sorely lacking. The challenge of an aging population is
not without influence on the housing stock and the foreseeable increase in
application of suitable housing close to services facilities. So those are the two
ends of the curve of demand for housing that are most needed.
Given this situation, it is the public housing policy capable of meeting the needs of
households and protect the casualization? Its current resources appear anyway
limited. For comparison, the social housing stock in France represents 17% of the frame, then
In Belgium, it equals only 7% although it hosts proportionately, more
elsewhere, very precarious people. 38,000 households waiting for social housing as well as
Wallonia, and 41 000 households in Brussels. In other words, the industry is not able or
to absorb the entire request, or to significantly influence the market. Yet the
Social housing is an effective weapon against precariousness, because the price of rent in housing
Social is on average € 233 in Wallonia and € 293 in Brussels for at least twice
on the private market.

However, despite the priorities established by regional governments, these tools do not
helped create enough housing or to organize an environment allowing all and
all to live in dignity.
An environmental issue
Not unrelated to this social challenge, another challenge is the residential sector: that of its
environmental implications. Housing generates indeed alone 14.8% of emissions
Gas greenhouse countries.
Thus, in terms of its configuration, the Belgian housing stock is generally true
energy sieve. Less than two roof is insulated on 4.1 million housing that
account Belgium and less than 20% of the houses are fully equipped with double glazing!
Belgium is therefore one of the lowest ranked countries for insulation of its walls; she
is in the same category as all the countries of southern Europe, but with climate and
sunshine but very different! In terms of loss of energy, it is even more clear:
Belgium is the lowest ranked countries. Less than 30% of our houses have exterior walls
isolated. This means the energy saving potential and thus saving money but also
less pollution, a massive investment in insulation. This remains a top priority that
should still be amplified in order to empower everyone to be able to invest in insulation
their homes and reduce energy bills up to 30% 5.
Finally, in terms of land territoire6, the political choices of the past have resulted
that Wallonia is facing a phenomenon of urban sprawl: in general,
finds inner-city population loss, loose suburbs, surrounded by villages where
create new subdivisions, the "ribbons". This dispersion of the habitat devour the land,
which generates also the construction of new roads, mainly
road. For induced effect, urban sprawl and participates widely in climate change,
mainly through the significant increase in car trips it induces.
In the Brussels Region
The general context of the Brussels Region can be characterized into five more accurately
Key words:
A majority rate tenants with almost 50% of the Brussels population housed on the
private rental market;
Exponential population growth that has seen the region go from 950,000
inhabitants in 1997 to nearly 1.14 million in 2012 - a growth of 190 000 inhabitants in
15 years - and announces 1.23 million inhabitants in 2020;
Eviction of the middle class which increased from 40.2% in 1998 to 34.2% in 2009 and
impoverishment of the population that is growing year by year;
A decrease in available land that can be allocated to housing, forcing, given the
demand growth, the best use of existing buildings and to devise strategies
reconstruction of the city on itself (by the office areas and reallocations
Old industry in particular);

Increased support conventionné housing, obligation to strive for 10% of social housing in municipalities

This context generates a strong social demand for housing since assesses today to more
to 55,000 the number of households waiting for public support in housing.
In Wallonia
The general context of Wallonia can also be characterized in five more accurately
Key words:
Majority ownership rate with over 70% of the population occupying its
own housing, a proportion of poor owners, helping to maintain
a sufficient quality fleet in terms of safety as energy performance;
A private rental Park representing about ¾ of the total housing stock, part of which is
a social housing to housing conditions significantly improvable;
A public park on the rise again after a previous policy sales and
demolition, but whose quality improvement should remain a priority;
A future population growth has not been sufficiently taken into account in
public policy and leading to an expected increase in demand for
housing, given an estimated population increase of more than 300 000 people
in the next 15 years;
A decrease in land available for habitat in some areas, and
Rising travel costs that force, given the growth in demand for use in
best existing buildings and imagine reconstruction strategies from the built fabric

This context also generates a strong social demand for housing can only go
increase in the coming years.
The political horizon of Ecolo for accommodation
Therefore, to meet the economic, social, climate, energy and
environmental, habitat to live a revolution, to reboot a centripetal movement
and respond to sustainable building criteria.
As a priority, housing policy must result in making massive and rapid provision
adapted housing, decent, healthy and very energy efficient and in all types of
housing. Financial access to housing must be guaranteed for the different categories of
Household (the "entry" into the housing as the costs associated with use). That means :
recognition of the role of the private rental market in the matching of a regulatory framework
adapted (price, landlord-tenant relationships ...), since the most people
youth, the most vulnerable and the poorest mainly housed there;
massive investment in the production and renovation of public housing units,
social housing to meet the needs and weigh on the market;
taking account of the energy issue as a new social question
prime; in this sense, it is essential to take measures to ensure all
and in priority to all and most vulnerable, to live in isolated dwellings and very
energy-efficient, so that their energy bill does not consume a
much of their budget;
actions to improve the health quality of housing: moisture, noise
and odor, lead pipe, radon, etc. ;
Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter ACCOMMODATION - 4/21 p simplifying access to housing, whether rental or acquisitive, supporting
new solutions taking into account the specificities of target audiences.
For Ecolo, housing policy is an integral part of social equity policies. What
involves reviewing all the devices in the light of the following principles:
the need to develop a solid plan house insulation;
consistency and transversality of social policy, fiscal, spatial
territory and mobility, including between the various levels of power;
greater regulation of the sector by the government, aimed at preventing
price increases real estate above inflation, while making sure not
discourage investment in the sector;
specific policies to target audiences (homeless families,
etc.), general measures to promote access to housing and political "bridge"
eg allowing to leave poor public policies specific to
access general measures.
Furthermore, regionalization announced the law on leases, as well as some of the deductions
tax in real estate matters is also an opportunity to redefine an effective framework
housing policy and guidance especially for the benefit of low- and middle households
income. Regions will include questions about the funding of the support policy
to home ownership and undoubtedly make choices. For Ecolo, the outbreak of
skills undermines the effectiveness of the housing policy. Intelligent regionalization can
So, in this case, used to instill consistency and vision in a fundamental policy
inscribed in the heart of everyone's life.
Finally, the functionalist logic that ruled the location of activities of the past. The
future housing must coexist with other functions (local services, deposits
employment ...) and, in particular, to organize more often around the transport. He will be
and denser and also draw as much as possible use of renewable energy.
The Ecolo force lines
Ecolo therefore proposes a series of measures to ensure that housing policy meets both
the social, economic and environmental outlined above:
Strengthening traditional operators in housing policy
Diversify aids public housing and balance territorially
Increase the number of public or supported housing
Continue public housing sector restructuring and strengthen the quality of
governance
Acting on the private housing and support access to property
Improve the quality of housing and energy consumption
Develop specific housing.
Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter ACCOMMODATION - p 5/21 The priorities and proposals Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: STRENGTHENING THE OPERATORS OF THE CLASSICS POLICY
HOUSING
Proposal: Allocate adequate budgets to housing policy and
develop a multiannual program
For Ecolo, the regional budget must allocate the resources necessary for the continued rise
Plan achievements of classical operators of housing policy. Thus, the means
will tend toward 5% of the general expenditure budget; goal achieved for the first time in
2013 Brussels Region.
Beside that, given the habitat requirements, mobilization of additional resources
regional budgets should be considered, either at European level or by mobilizing
private savings (Type Booklet vert7 and support to cooperative systems, for example).
The size of housing needs also requires the development from the beginning of
the legislature of multiannual programs, like the communal anchor program
Wallonia. This programming will exempt investment policies
cyclical upheavals availability of public finances.
Finally, the Regions must put up with a suitable common contracting, but
mandatory program for achieving the quantitative target of Professional housing
social in each.
Proposal: To coordinate and strengthen regional operators
partnerships between operators
Partnerships between public operators must be enabled for the valuation areas
priority development, identified by the Government and partly allocated to housing.
The objectives are to maintain land control by the public, diversity
housing (typologies and public-targets), and the multi-functionality (equipment
group, green areas ...). In Brussels Reyers Jehoshaphat and Heysel Tour and Taxis are well
mainly targeted. These partnerships should gradually become the reference modality
public action.
Ecolo also proposes that the housing authority towards its regional coordination role
strengthened, including through the establishment of a steering and monitoring the achievement of the policy
housing. Different operators must be associated, through a panel to
continue the implementation of the objectives of 15% Public Housing Management Professional
social in the Brussels Region and 10% in Wallonia, 2020. This control must
in particular allow to value the dynamic action planning and programming
ways.
Finally, housing policy, to be effective and help to enhance the coherence and
dynamism of the regional public action, should be around a regional coordination
involving all opérateurs8.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter ACCOMMODATION - p 6/21 PRIORITY 2: DIVERSIFICATION AID AND BALANCING THE TERRITORIAL
PUBLIC HOUSING
Public housing production through the Public Service of Real Estate Companies (SISP) and
Public Service Housing Corporation (SLSP) is a particularly slow process. Development
projects, obtaining planning permission, the various supervisory phases, risks related
public procurement (no bidder bankrupt companies) make the time
realization of a project, from the notification of the budgetary commitment by the Government and
the entry of the first tenants, often exceeds 5 years. However, the need for housing
Additional urgent. Various administrative simplification measures have been taken under
this Parliament but they may partially reduce this delay production
housing.
Accordingly, if the creation of public housing must be maintained and even strengthened
up to 2500 units per year in Wallonia and 2 000 a year in Brussels, other devices
must also allow rapid increase in the supply of decent housing, performing on the
energy level, well located and affordable. These devices are intended to
increase either the regulated rental supply, eg private housing in management or decision
by building charges (providing that housing produced by the private sector are made
provision of public housing policy); the offer is acquisitive, by formulas
the cost of restricting access to property, for example by setting up
Community Land Trust9 or the mortgage lending at subsidized rates.
Proposal: To facilitate access to the private rental unit
Public precarious
Develop regulated housing
In Wallonia, the rental housing sector including private renting is regulated by the mechanism
taken in management account for about 3.5% of the stock of public housing and the like. TO
Brussels, Social Agencies Estate sector represents 6% of public rental market.
For Ecolo, various measures must be amplified to strongly develop this formula
of regulated housing.
For renovation of real estate given in management to their AIS
owners, financial aid should continue to be granted taking into account
dwelling size and length of management decision.
In construction, new initiatives should be taken to make
private landlord owns a producer of regulated housing. Any citizen who invest
Production in January-February new housing, efficient and energy-

Excluding management decision, in accordance with the allocation priorities, a rent subsidy will be granted
to persons who are candidates for social housing and entering conditions

positive difference between the rent corresponding to the market price (determined according to the
location and housing characteristics) and a third of household income.
Overall, the idea is firstly to ensure the owner a reasonable return while
would rent at market price or below and, secondly, ensuring effective rent level for
tenants giving them access to housing, while it would be difficult or not possible
in the private market "classic".
To prevent the rent allowance does not result in an increase in rents on the market,
Such a system will be implemented simultaneously with the implementation of a mentoring system
General rents qu'Ecolo offers elsewhere (see priority 6).
Set up a regional fund rent guarantees
Furthermore, the rental guarantee is an important element in the search for housing.
Many prospective tenants find it difficult to provide such guarantee, which can
actually hinder their access to the housing market. Ecolo proposes to establish a fund
Central rent guarantees: this regional fund would bring forward the first guarantee
rental (for the public precarious) and a spread repayment over a certain period based on
income, so the cost will be low for the Region.
Supporting actors that make available a social purpose housing
Associations, churches and other factories of civil society with goods or
wishing to invest their funds in real estate will also be helped financially
when they agree to put the built or renovated housing provision of actors such as
Social Real Estate Agencies (AIS), housing promotion associations (APL) ....

Proposal: Create public housing by imposing
building charges
Any real estate project housing or offices above a certain number of housing or
m² of offices should contain:
Free or sale of building land in town that will affect the
public housing;
or selling to a cost price of housing to be determined, to a SSSI
(Lands of public service in Brussels) or SLSP (Housing Corporation
Public Service Wallonia), depending on the size of the project and its possible location
in high-pressure real estate area.
Ecolo proposes that the conditions for the transfer or sale be revised upwards when
real estate projects are made of become buildable areas through projects
densification of existing buildings. The amounts thus collected could be allocated to a Fund
dedicated, used to balance the losses.

Proposal: Supporting new forms of housing
Ecolo proposes to support and encourage the development of alternative forms of access to
housing and types of housing. This example of cooperative formulas, the
mutualisation of the acquisition of Community land trust (CLT), dwelling transit,
grouped housing, the long lease ... Thus, the establishment of genuine legal arrangements and
Financial should facilitate the implementation of such projects while avoiding
pitfalls related to the status of each habitant10. These tools must be able to maintain control

public on the ground, lower occupancy costs for end-occupiers to invest in
related functions (such as utilities) to appeal to private funds and
up public-private partnerships and public-private-associative.
Like the Brussels Region, the CLT tool should also locate in Wallonia, beyond
Many local experiments in progress. The goal is to allow access to property
through a sustainable investment for households with low income or means.
Besides the interest of generating a collective or community dynamics, the system of
Community Land Trust captures a portion of the capital gain on resale of
housing and reinvest in the production of other housing social nature. Otherwise,
CLT these projects can also be the subject of partnerships, including with companies
the-job training in order to support self-build.
Finally, Ecolo proposes that regional public bodies are granted means
budget in order to constitute land reserves in order to develop new projects
forms of housing, especially in areas with high real estate pressure.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter ACCOMMODATION - p 9/21

PRIORITY 3: INCREASE PUBLIC HOUSING OR BOXES
Ecolo intends to increase production and renovate public housing or boxes. It's about
so :
create new social housing (housing continuation of the Plan, Alliance and Habitat
anchor of municipal programs);
renovate the existing portfolio (PIVERT Plan in Wallonia Region quadrennial Plans
Brussels ...);
create and renovate homes for social purposes (housing policies,
housing managed by AIS, homes purchased via using the Housing Fund,
acquired via social housing loans) by means of the usual regional arrangements:
Contracts RBC sustainable neighborhoods, urban renewal in Wallonia Guide Map
urban renewal, extension of rental park Aids Housing Fund,
development of housing stock Housing Fund and the SDRB, contracting
with municipalities, AIS ...
Private large-scale real estate projects must also incorporate a quota
Modular housing with social purposes, based on the needs and communal context.
Moreover, when real estate capital gains are generated by significant changes
allocation or template that increase the value of the property, offers a system of Ecolo
recovery of these gains for the benefit of public housing.
Ecolo also offers a series of other specific measures:
-

Reduce construction time: delays and cumbersome procedures are
singled out as real obstacles to construction. A procedure
Built for housing, which aims to divide by three times
administrative procedure, should facilitate the realization of operations
Planning and building comprising mainly housing and
considered of general interest;

-

Encourage conversions of empty buildings housing social purpose in
establishing incentives, activating public operators alongside
private operators and sanctioning prolonged inoccupations.

The Brussels level:
-

Overly strict rules regarding car (obligation to provide
parking spaces) lead to an increase in cost of project
construction and should be eased, since the real estate project is located
close to public transport;

-

Should be promoted, in some cases, the elevation of buildings: for
encourage densification of already urbanized areas, certain derogations
town planning rules must be in place to allow the raising
building and aligning the height between adjoining buildings (
in "hollow tooth");

At the Walloon level:
-

Reclassification of the operations of public housing neighborhoods such as
"Transition Areas" should be pursued in order to renew the image of
Park public housing and reinsert it into the built fabric of the neighborhood.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter ACCOMMODATION - p 10/21

PRIORITY 4: FURTHER RESTRUCTURING OF HOUSING SECTOR
PUBLIC AND ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE

Proposal: Continue the public housing sector restructuring
The housing development must be accelerated to meet the changing demand,
approaches prospective tenants must be facilitated and simplified, the existing fleet must be
set standards and image of the sector must be improved.
To face these challenges, public housing companies (SLSP and SISP) should be able
benefit from the financial, technical and human resources necessary to achieve their
missions. The ability to act many companies offers potential that can benefit the
community beyond the only real estate management of the public park. This is as true
Public real estate operators that some companies will both better fulfill their
missions, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and provide service to local government
within the framework of territorial development and urban and rural redevelopment.
In this context, a reorganization of the sector is needed in order to improve balance
these financial companies reduce direct and indirect costs, and enhance professionalism
provide more and more powerful tools for companies to simplify the procedures of
beneficiaries and support, as well as to manage and develop their housing stock.
Ecolo proposes to strengthen the capacity of the sector through concrete actions:
Support the establishment of service centers which companies may appeal
to benefit from expertise (planning, architecture, computer -
unique software, public, human resource management markets, finance ...) and for
pooling of resources (specialist staff working governed) and benefit from savings
ladders (grouped procurement, purchasing stock market ...);
Strengthening the role of the Walloon Housing Society and the Housing Society
Brussels Capital Region as a center of expertise in terms of mounting
real estate projects, research and development in the field of construction
housing and support for housing companies in these areas, with long views
term ;
Continue to support the merger process between housing companies, to achieve
an optimal size for them to manage and develop their housing park
efficiently. The groupings should be encouraged not to have priority
at most only one company per municipality. This should contribute to strengthening the
coherence of actions at the local level and simplification of the coordination between
players. The size and organization of companies must allow each of
have within them the necessary resources in terms of administrative,
financial, technical and leasable in order to provide quality service and
close to tenants, in a social and human approach (thanks to
Social referent, the cornerstone of social support) and to maintain and
develop their heritage;
Implement a recurring financial mechanism for the maintenance and upgrading

Evaluate the possibility for regional authorities to "regionalize" the companies with
significant management deficiencies, to enable their cleanup and

Strengthen the training of administrators and corporate directions to improve
governance, develop and strengthen strategic management experience in all
the areas of management and business development of societies;
Evaluate the possibility of opening boards to directors

limited period in order to strengthen the expertise of the housing corporations;
Continue sector efforts to reduce the vacancy rate in housing
Social and improve the energy efficiency of housing;
Encourage the search for additional financing, particularly in Europe;
Revise the calculation of social rent and charges with the following objectives:
-

pursuing a social rental policy, able to allow access to a
decent housing to households meeting the entry requirements, while
attentive to his fairness and equal treatment of tenants and ensuring a
progressive adaptation for existing tenants;

-

financially sustain the sector, namely to ensure the financial balance of
Short housing companies, medium and long term, making sure to maintain a
solidarity mechanism at a height objectified into account the quality of the
management of companies through the fiscal contribution of the Regions;

-

simplify the calculation of rent and charges, to ensure readability and control
by stakeholders, chief among them the tenants;

-

account for the charges in the amount of the rental cost of social housing
introducing the notion of occupancy costs in order to pool between all
social tenants the benefit of energy-saving investments;

-

ensure that, at unchanged conditions, occupancy costs (rent and addition
fillers) does not increase.

In Wallonia, the restructuring of the sector and its development will not occur without
reintroduction of a real relationship of trust between the Walloon Housing Society and
SLSP. To do this, new places of dialogue between stakeholders should be established.
Finally, for the Brussels Region, the current funding of the investment policy system
should be reviewed to encourage even more the SISP to invest in housing. In addition, the
moratorium on the sale of social housing should be maintained.
Moreover, the regional solidarity allowance must be calculated on the basis of the difference between
rental income and the "reference costs" of the SISP. These equivalent including fees
inherent in managing a SSSI prepared on a standard regional basis and reflect
also costs involved in managing a housing stock (unpaid, rental voids, renovation
light ...) and the specificities of the SISP (especially according to the historical heritage
each SISP and annuities).

Proposal: Strengthen the quality of governance
The sector of public housing has long been connoted negatively, because of a lack of
transparency in its management and in housing allocations but also in view

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter ACCOMMODATION - p 12/21

of inadequate governance, let alone in an area under a social policy. Since in
many years, audit, appointment of commissioners of ethics and professional conduct have
helped to supervise and regulate this sector more in Wallonia. These steps already existed
Brussels.
The fact remains that efforts are still needed:
Apply more transparent measures to ensure that prospective tenants or tenants
Unsuccessful candidates for mutation12 are better informed. Like the initiative taken
Wallonia, independent social workers must sit on committees
award in Brussels;
At the level of governance, make greater management indicators for
Working to ensure a comparison between SSSI and SLSP for finding a way
more uniform operation. Decrees of existing provisions
remuneration of general managers and directors to be executed;
Invite small companies to merge or create minimum service stations
with other companies in order to be more effective in a number of trades not
available within the company. Rationalization proposals will be validated by a
external analysis. It's the same for AIS;
Develop training for administrators of these local actors both in terms of
governance on technical plans such as public procurement, financial management,
staff development, etc. ;
In terms of user participation, more broadly recognize the contribution of the committees
advisory. It should also be invited to expand their representative basis within
Social cities. Finally, the electoral process must be revised to make this moment a
real-time participation, debate and internal democracy sector;
Invite regional organizations in the sector to draw up their own code of ethics and
ethics. The efforts in this area and the action plans for success
enhance the level of transparency and governance could be rewarded

rental and acquisitive, but also in terms of quality, including environmental,
housing ;
For all projects of production and renovation of housing managed by
public operators, or similar, provide a dynamic participation upstream
initiation of projects;
Like what exists in Wallonia, create an Ombudsman in Brussels, at least one
Ombudsman for accommodation;
Set up within the Housing Directorate dashboard procedures

PRIORITY 5: IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF HOUSING AND CONSUMPTION
ENERGY
For many years, the rental policy in the public park has kept the
rents well below the average rent in the private rental park. The same can not
unfortunately be performed to the level of charges. Given their position in the
Energy Plan, of public housing experiencing very high loads,
negating the impact in terms of purchasing power of a regulated rent policy.
In the private sector, the average insulation standards of dwellings are comparable to
countries of southern Europe, which also induces high loads.
It is therefore necessary to further boost investment in energy performance.

Proposal: Continue to invest heavily in housing insulation and
efficient heating systems
Spurred environmentalists, the first Alliances Job Environment were launched
Brussels and Wallonia. Governments and their partners - Federations of business
construction, public interest organizations and public services, trade unions, training providers,
groupings and associations active in the field of construction and sustainable development
- Mobilize around a common goal: make the improvement of the environment through efficiency
energy housing, a source of economic opportunities and job creation.
Specifically, the Regions and their partners agree on three fronts:
Stimulating demand for renovation and sustainable construction of private buildings
public including through public aid as bonuses or loans;
Strengthen the supply and construction sector capacity;

Developing skills through a comprehensive program of training green.
Ecolo will continue this alliance and, based on the experience gained in developing
news in other sectors.

Proposal: Reduce energy bills for tenants and propriétairesoccupants continuing support for investment "savers"
Energy
To reduce the energy consumption of landlords and tenants and enable them to
finance the necessary works, Ecolo proposes to continue and strengthen the implementation of
financial proposals, as Ecopack in Wallonia, for those who do not have
own funds to make the necessary investments in their housing.
After conducting an energy audit, the Regions may propose, via agencies
existing, making a funding mechanism "painless" investment in
energy conservation and renewable energy. Indeed, the household should not advance
equity and repaid monthly payment would remain less than or equal to energy savings
realized through lower energy bills.
Persons for whom an abnormally high power consumption is detected during
audit or on the basis of invoices, should also benefit from support type
Energy guidance, accompanying the granting of the aid.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter ACCOMMODATION - p 14/21

Finally, to allow tenants to benefit from the positive effects of this formula, Ecolo
proposes to extend access to the device to landlords without the cost of using
housing (rent + energy bills) will increase.

Proposal: Improve energy efficiency in housing
Develop guidance, the energy audit
Currently, only CPAS and eco-smugglers (Wallonia) carry out guidances
energy. Ecolo believes that other operators (as examples, communal services,
energy suppliers within the framework of public service obligations, unions or
associations ...) should be able, where appropriate, take the initiative of these guidances, including
when abnormally high energy consumption are recognized by suppliers.
The energy audit should also be encouraged. It will indicate to the owners and
tenants work to be done in their home, establishing a priority of
investments according to their cost-effectiveness, their impact on consumption
energy and emissions of greenhouse gases.
Set ambitious energy standards
To make the housing stock and much more efficient offices, it is necessary to
strengthen the implementation of the directive on the energy performance of buildings and extend its
scope to any renovation of housing and any provision of housing. It
will set stricter energy standards in the medium term and support from
Today the low-energy house renovation and construction of passive houses very few
consuming. From 2015, the aim should be not to realize that the new
passive constructions (1.5 liters of fuel oil or 15 kWh / m² / year) and "low energy" renovations
(3 liters of fuel oil or 30 kWh / m² / year), the objective being the home positive energy for 2020.
Drastically reduce the dependence of fossil energy housing
Particularly for Brussels:
From now on, we must significantly improve the quality of public and private housing. To this end,
the Brussels Region should ensure:
add or review certain environmental criteria included in the Regional Regulation
Urbanism (noise, waterproofing ...);
strengthen support instruments to operators: Bouwmeester Master Architect
(BMA), the center of expertise BGHM ...;
develop quality statistics, including energy, through the land registry;
ensuring control of the registration of leases in order to have a better understanding of
private market;
integrate social and environmental clauses in the specifications of
housing production.
Specifically for Wallonia:
For 2020, rental accommodation must necessarily meet a criterion linked to the
energy performance will be considered satisfied if:
the roof is insulated in accordance with the criteria defined by the Region;
the heating system is not powered by electricity except: heaters
Extra; heat pumps; these installations in homes and
Passive apartments; these installations in buildings that meet the
requirements of quasi-zero energy buildings.

PRIORITY 6: ACTING ON HOUSING AND PRIVATE ACCESS TO SUPPORT
PROPERTY

Proposal: Targeting aid on low incomes and investments
energy savings
For Ecolo, the aid (premiums, allowances ...) to individuals should be primarily targeted
to the lower income and middle income, with escalation. They can
nevertheless also target broader audiences, when it comes to achieve better performance
energy housing or promote a central location in the territory.

Proposal: Frame rents
It is also necessary to establish a system of regulation of the rental market. Under this system, the
rent could be revised upwards - including at the signing of a new lease - that
below the limit of inflation or due to investments or significantly improving comfort
causing a significant drop in the cost of expenses (eg via improved
energy performance of the property).

Proposal: Help dwelling acquisition
Ecolo proposes to help low and middle income households to acquire their housing
strengthening the capacity of public actors: the Housing Fund, the SDRB, the Walloon Society
Social Credit ...
It is also necessary to encourage the production of new housing sales price (or
rents) accessed by the greatest number, particularly by fiscal measures, while ensuring
the architectural quality of achievements.
More specifically, for the middle class, Ecolo offers:
Through the Social Credit sector, to develop a regional scheme guaranteeing
Access to acquisition for middle-income households that do not respond to
Conditions Social Housing Fund loans or credit Walloon Company
Social (SWCS) and for which access to capital markets is rendered problematic seen
the conditions set by the banks;
In Wallonia, to conduct operations such as those developed by the Company
Development for the Brussels-Capital Region (SDRB) to allow,
especially in areas with high land pressure and neighborhoods to reclassify the
housing production to low-income households and middle
seeking access to property;
In Brussels, strengthen support tools for the acquisition of average households, among others
via BRDA projects, tools Housing Fund (loans and operations CRV -
Legal Sale) and through appropriate taxation;
In Brussels, extend to 40 years the age limit for public housing assistance
designed for "young families" (set at 35 years old) saw the decline of age
maternity and later saw the departure of young people to the periphery, ensuring a fair
balance between the regional intervention means accommodations, moderate and socially.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter ACCOMMODATION - p 16/21

Proposal: To fight against discrimination in access to housing
Housing has become one of the fields where discrimination based particularly on origin,
income, sexual orientation or belief, are most frequent. The barometer
recently launched diversity should allow to better understand this problem and to implement
effective responses to address them. Donor awareness should be improved,
along with information of the means tenants have to enforce their rights.

PRIORITY 7: DEVELOP SPECIFIC AND SUITABLE HOUSING
Proposal: Diversifying the supply of housing for elderly
Due to the aging population, it is important to meet the specific request of the
elderly population, both quantitatively and qualitatively. There are indeed
alternative pathways to the nursing home where the elderly are losing independence.
Ecolo proposes to expand the offer and respond appropriately to the needs of people
Elderly:
Supporting through regional investment programs development
Social serviced residences, offering both accommodation and friendly services
allowing elderly and, therefore, the home support for people with loss
autonomy;
Support through the same investment programs creating projects
intergenerational or community housing for single people and / or
families, ages and diversified revenues, coasting is in the same building; such
including project can be driven from the conversion of rest houses
no longer meet profitability thresholds for this type of infrastructure;
Strengthen partnerships between the public operators and housing associations
active in helping people13;
Support the creation of housing "kangaroo", which are individual housing
flexible according to the stages of life that occupy the household. Thus, a young couple
can occupy the first floor of a house, for example leaving the ground floor an
Old person. This requires the provision from the building design modulating
housing inside the building. This modulation allows each party withdraws
benefit from the fact of living together. To this end, there is a mortgage formula
with the Social Housing Fund. This must be completed for dwellings
do not require transformations, by a certification managed by an association of
Housing Promotion. Beyond the support brick, Ecolo intends, moreover, to adjust
permanently at the federal level the issue of criminalization of housing
solidarity and its negative financial impact on revenue benefiting people Income
of substitution ;
Support the development of solidarity between habitat elderly, like the
Examples of Abbeyfield (Walloon Brabant). The support may cover up projects
including financial and legal aspects are now often prohibitive, firstly,
and the provision of land or public buildings in order to develop this kind
projects in the context of municipal investment programs, on the other.

13
In Brussels, implement the recommendations of the group "right to housing" of the Interministerial Conference
including ensuring nurture partnerships between operators in housing policy and institutions services
competent Community in CBR.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter ACCOMMODATION - p 17/21

Proposal: Propose housing available to students
Studies of student housing needs has been conducted by the Governments
Wallonia and Brussels. It appears that it is the quality and price of kots, far more than their
nombre14, which, generally speaking, a problem. Furthermore, students are sometimes
clueless about their owner.
To remedy this, Ecolo offers:
Sustaining the AIS mechanism "student" and extend it to the municipalities with large populations
student. This formula responds to the lack of intermediary between owners and students,
kot guarantees quality at affordable prices and stimulate supply;
Support the creation of public housing buildings for students in
investment programs of municipalities in which the mismatch of supply and
demand for student housing is established;
Strengthening partnerships with universities and colleges and increasing
devices to better inform students about finding accommodation
(eg platform "Brik" in Brussels);
Support any initiative aimed at developing the student homestay in
intergenerational perspective, like for example the experience "A roof, two
ages "15;
Provide a lease student taking into account the specific situation of
student-tenants (short-term lease, pending vacancy frequent in the summer months,
rental guarantee to pay together with the costs involved in the return, situation
Erasmus (in and out) ...)
To reflect on the phenomenon that particularly affects roommate
young people (students or professionals) and calls for the development of tools and information
suitable for both landlords and tenants.

Proposal: Addressing the needs of disabled people through
needs housing
The number of suitable and adaptable housing in both the private and public park, and both
home-only rental property are too few, despite the laws in
force.
To initiate real change, we must educate the public and housing developers
which do not sufficiently take into account the life cycle when designing their
housing. For example, "Building and renovation with adaptability" is a program of
training of architects and construction trades that meets this need. He imports,
moreover, stimulate supply. Any new investment program will maintain a
high percentage of adaptable housing, financial amounts provided for integrating housing
the additional costs generated by this type of housing.
Ecolo want more:
Make effective regulations for the labeling of dwellings;
Stimulate the creation of suitable and adaptable housing in the private housing by
the introduction of a premium for certified housing.

Except in Namur and Louvain-la-Neuve, where a shortage exists.

Proposal: To provide suitable accommodation for single-parent households and
large families
There is an increase in the number of single-parent households, the result of evolution
sociological families and the legislation on joint custody. Neither the social housing or the park
Private not offer enough suitable housing at affordable prices.
Besides the introduction of the mutation to proportionate mechanism allowing housing
release-occupied housing today as in social housing, Ecolo wants:
Increase the supply of housing in the large social housing;
Support cities that offer the acquisition or enhancement of land or
buildings to build or renovate homes within structures
Type "Community land trust." The social credit agencies were tasked by
Moreover, to develop credit products adapted to this type of project.

SENIORS AND PENSIONS
An intergenerational society
Status and political horizon
State of play
Seniors, seniors, seniors, expressions are scrambling to designate a portion of
population contours increasingly blurred.
Seniors are indeed a very heterogeneous population in terms of age, status
health, financial situation, in particular. This is a population including the 3rd, the 4th and
sometimes the fifth age, the first occupant of the latest frequently. A majority of seniors
Women, particularly in older age groups.
The average life expectancy in good health has increased by 24 years in the 20th century and continues to
progress: we win now also in Belgium, a quarter every year in
life expectancy ! Belgium has therefore more than two million pensioner-es, about
fifth of its population.
For various reasons, including the arrival at the pension children of the baby boom and a declining birth rate
the lengthening of life, this proportion will only increase over the next
years. Today, 1.9 million people over 65 in Belgium (17.6% of the
population). In 2030 it will be 2.7 million people (or 22.6% of the population). The
dependency ratio, that is to say the ratio of people aged 65 and over and
people between 15 and 64 years, gradually from 26.8% today to 37.3% in 2060.
This dramatic change called thoughtful and appropriate policy responses since it
involves increasing the specific needs of seniors and their caregivers, which is
not without consequences for the evolution of our social security system. It also provides
opportunities for innovation and development in the research, production and
product development, activities and specific services. Therefore it is
a source of jobs for younger generations. Finally, if a party is marked seniors
by dépendance1, a very large share of people over 65 living in good health and
has expertise, experience, time, energy and even their financial resources
to live well. Some want to put it at the service of society through an activity
as a volunteer, parent, citizen, consumer or worker.
Since the '80s, we must see an erosion in the management of certain risks
social Security. This erosion is sensitive in the pension sector, particularly
for the lowest and oldest of them.
Pension reform, voted on and passed hussar late 2011 by the Federal majority confirms
the trend towards questioning and weakening the rights: elimination periods
assimilated, tightening of conditions for access to the pension (in terms of age and number
years of work) ... So she spends the extension of the effective lives of employees
without consideration of their working conditions, the same time the absence of fishing
1
5-8% of Belgians live in rest homes. Besides that, more than three-quarters of people over 60 are
in good health.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter OLDER AND PENSIONS - p. 1/25

proposals on the social and financial sustainability of our pensions or consideration
the difficult working conditions.
In this context, the risk of poverty (defined as 60% of median income) amounts to today
20.2% for over 65s and 21.4% for more than 75 years. Older women
more affected than men by poverty.
Finally, one of the largest institutional reforms just ended. It relates to
especially seniors as rest homes, nursing homes and care and
assistance to the elderly will now be fully managed by the federated entities. It's about
there a real opportunity to bring innovations and reforms necessary in this
sector to a more adapted to the needs of seniors policy.
An intergenerational solidarity society like political horizon
The Ecolo social project reaffirms and strengthens reciprocity and solidarity between generations,
without discrimination. This solidarity is expressed in particular through the guarantee for each
elder, as indeed for every member of society to benefit from material conditions and
Social enabling him to live a decent life and contribute to the collective future of society.
Seniors, their experience, are a real societal wealth. Their potential must be valued,
which involves changes both in attitudes towards them in practices and
policies towards them and in all sectors.
Policies to seniors should focus on the ability of the elderly,
even dependent, to keep control of their choices and their lives. Old people
must continue to choose as long as possible where they live, people with
who share their hobbies, their meals, many emancipatory acts for seniors.
The fact of getting older often reveal new needs of development
spaces, help and support, necessary to maintain a dignified existence. Most
Seniors want to live at home and be as independent as possible, be considered
full citizens and, as such, participate in social and political life. This does
undeniable that, for some people, aging brings physical disorders and / or
psychic that can go up to total dependence.
Therefore Ecolo supports modernization of the organization of policies to
Seniors and transition from institutional care to that of logical consideration
the life project of people and their changing needs. The company must ensure the
right to support and help, in good physical conditions, emotional and
psychological and respect for the dignity of each and every one.
In this context, unlike pension reform took place in 2011, it is urgent to
implement measures to ensure the financial viability of the system and upgrade the
statutory pensions of all workers, regardless of their professional status, starting with
the lowest, to ensure to all recipients a decent standard of living.
Furthermore, Ecolo opposes any attempt to increase the theoretical retirement age beyond
65 and intends to act on the workplace to improve conditions throughout working
life, strengthen mechanisms for reconciling private and professional life, taking into account
career development and help maintain the employment of older workers. It should
Also adapt working conditions and working environment to labor
of different ages, fighting against discrimination and negative stereotypes which are particularly
Victims older workers and, finally, to strengthen the skills of older workers.
Finally, to meet the financial challenge of the aging population, it is necessary to operate
various levers, whether a better contribution of capital - especially speculative - at
financing of collective functions and solidarity, a more effective fight against fraud
tax or an increase in the employment rate, especially for seniors.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter OLDER AND PENSIONS - p. 2/25

The Ecolo force lines
The profound transformation of the age pyramid entails considerable changes
the general organization of society, the implementation of solidarity, allocation of resources,
etc.
The policy for seniors should be optimized in many areas because it affects
all areas of life: social affairs, social security, health, finance, culture, security,
land use, transportation, housing ... In this sense, it calls for coordination
close to the municipalities of Europe initiatives.

In this context, promoted by Ecolo power lines are:
Ensure the conditions of the "aging well"
Accompany the lengthening of the duration of careers
Give priority to ensuring the legal pension income to older people who their
allow to live in dignity and ensuring the credibility of the first pillar
Reforming the 2nd and 3rd pillar pension, preserve them from speculation and focus their
investment towards financing of sustainable economic activities and proximity
Give a place to live for every eldest according to his project
Improve expectancy of life in good health
Supporting families and loved ones of addicts
Support professionals.

Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: ENSURE THE TERMS OF "AGING WELL"
Proposal: To enhance accessibility for everyone
The accessibility of places
In too many circumstances, imperfect or impossible to access places and public buildings
literally prevents the elderly (as people with disabilities or elsewhere2
Sometimes families with young children) to participate in social life. So it is
the inaccessibility of some vehicles and / or boarding and disembarkation places,
sidewalks too high, irregular or cluttered, including illegal parking, the
too narrow doors, the lack of lifts, adapted sanitary ... To this list is added the
base relocation services such as post offices and bank branches as well
local shops. This forced the people with reduced mobility to new
travel the sometimes insurmountable difficulties.
A number of significant progress from this point of view, been fulfilled. Accessibility
stations and trains SNCB and the definition of accessibility standards or information to the public
Wallonia were strengthened. It is appropriate for further action in this direction, in particular to
to expand access facilities for people with reduced mobility to trains, trams, buses and metros.
Similarly, at the level of villages, neighborhoods and the city, welcoming sidewalks,
pedestrian crossings secure, easy access to green spaces and the presence of benches

disabilities ".

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter OLDER AND PENSIONS - p. 3/25

allow to rest are likely to enhance the mobility of the elderly and to avoid
their isolation.
The accessibility of activities
This is both to strengthen the offer of cultural and leisure activities to help seniors
take initiatives, but also to give them the opportunity to extend a voluntary activity or
paid, when they want. The activity falls for seniors so that they can society
provide that the contribution of their experience to the company. These reinforce the mutual contributions
intergenerational solidarity.
At the same time, it is also to help older workers to update their skills and
support seniors initiatives to help the next generation to undertake
activity by providing their knowledge and experience. Finally, it should also be
help create spaces where meet the communal public observatory, responsible to meet
the needs of seniors, the center (inter) municipal healthcare, specializing in care
health for seniors, and businesses, to promote innovation and the development of
products and services for seniors.
Accessibility of services and knowledge
Access to a number of public or private services or leisure activities require
increasingly to be connected and know how to handle computers. It is not given
everyone and what is considered as progress for many providers and
beneficiaries constitutes an insurmountable barrier for many seniors.
Therefore Ecolo offers:
to ensure that all those who wish to have access to all service even if it
has no computer and an Internet connection;
help seniors who want to train in the use of the Internet and the tool
IT.
The accessibility of cultural activities, through time management
Municipalities, cultural centers, theaters, etc. regularly organize activities
cultural addressed to seniors, but many activities and shows can be their
inaccessible because they are held in the evening. Indeed, the lack of public transport, the
fear of the dark and the pace of life are different barriers to participation in the life
Cultural seniors. Therefore it is appropriate, firstly, to improve nocturnal transport offer
together and the feeling of safety in public spaces and, secondly, to integrate
organizing regular performances during the day. This would allow seniors to share
cultural moments with younger and better and perceive the evolution of modes
expression.

Proposal: Establish a complementary insurance to autonomy
existing solidarity mechanisms
Belgium is one of the EU countries that spend the least amount of public resources to care not
health for the elderly. And while the needs in this area are constantly
changes saw the continued increase in life expectancy and changing family nuclei.
Ecolo wants to extend security and protections for seniors to counter the process of
impoverishment and to ensure a life of dignity and quality.
To enable everyone to live as long as possible autonomy and to take
account the phenomenon of increased life expectancy, proposes to establish a Ecolo
complementary to existing self-insurance solidarity federal plans and devices

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter OLDER AND PENSIONS - p. 4/25

regional. Insurance autonomy in the form of monthly allowance, would redistribution
the benefit of people in dependency. Its operation shall be entrusted to the social partners.
Through this self-assurance, it will help meet the needs for assistance
home (meals, presence, housekeeper, not medical care), the cost of a possible
accommodation in rest homes, maintaining relationships and social life and active recreation,
the management of places of life, loss of independence or even the occasional support to families
and / or having the care of relatives or a senior.
This response will contribute to both quality of life of seniors and elders and their families at the
creating new jobs or even cost savings in the area of ​​security
social, since this aid could be replaced, shorten or postpone a hospital stay or
in a specialized institution.
Finally, the transfer of the APA (allowance for care for the elderly) and mobility aids to
the federated entities, provides an opportunity to extend material assistance to more than 65 years. Indeed, this
day a person whose disability appears after age 65 may not enjoy the same
aids a person whose disability has previously appeared.

Proposal: End the isolation of seniors
The isolation of the elderly is a reality that goes along with the evolution of our societies. The
departure of children, grandchildren who live farther away, retirement, loss of spouse,
gradual departure of friends and the entourage of the same generation, cause slowly
the isolation of many elderly.
It is possible to combat this isolation particular to the neighborhood level, and raising awareness
stakeholders have to work with the elderly:
Create meeting places in neighborhoods through social cohesion plans to
to promote exchanges between citizens, including with Seniors: meeting spaces,
intergenerational, benches activities;
Prevent suicide among the elderly. The suicide rate of people over 70
years is among the highest. In Belgium, suicide risk increases with age, with
a peak at around 45 years and a second peak at age 75. Specific actions
beings must therefore undertaken to these publics3;
Enhance training for various stakeholders to listen and to dialogue;
Integrate network practices in social workers working patterns
acting in all sectors (disability, youth, aids and home care)
which involve taking into account and develop partnerships with
neighborhood residents, including seniors;
Provide seniors who want the opportunity to live with other generations
supporting intergenerational habitat;
Train seniors to new technologies, internet social networks, which
can facilitate contact between seniors and their loved ones, or even to develop
new links.

For more information on the proposals for Ecolo in the prevention of suicide, especially among seniors, see
Chapter "Health".

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter OLDER AND PENSIONS - p. 5/25

Proposal: Engaging Seniors
Strengthen and equip municipal advisory councils of elders
Essential tools for participation, advisory councils of elders at the municipal level are
increasingly present in our towns, especially in Brussels. In Wallonia, they
recently been fonctionnement4 a study which emphasizes a disparity as
in the missions assigned to them by the municipality in their composition. This disparity is
Also present in the Brussels Region.
To promote this tool and give it a real participatory role, Ecolo wants the legal framework
be strengthened and he can receive subsidies for certain activities.
Guaranteeing the right to vote to seniors
The effectiveness of the right to vote to all seniors and elders must be guaranteed by strengthening accessibility
to vote5 offices. The municipality must provide a suitable device or transport vehicles
collective to the polling stations and officials consider installing polling stations in
nursing homes. And, particularly, to put an end to clientelistic practices
prevail in the elections.

Generalize advice to all residents childcare
Councils of residents are now required in each nursing home. Places
can express the demands, interests and grievances, they allow management by
residents in their daily lives and their future.
Ecolo wants to boost the advice of residents, empowering them where this proves
necessary, and extend the approach by generalizing in all reception and
hosting, not only in rest homes.

PRIORITY 2: SUPPORT EXTENSION OF THE DURATION OF CAREERS
The recent pension reform has focused on the only lengthening careers. TO
Following this reform, citizens may not benefit from a full pension after 40
year career, provided they have reached the age of 62 years6. If they have not accumulated the years
career, they will have to work until 65. However, even if the data on the career span
There are few now, we see that these career conditions are far from
always met, especially for women, and that workers therefore have significantly
lengthen their careers. Thus, according to the Review Committee on the vieillissement7, the average duration of
careers is 37.1 years in Belgium. According to a study published by the Steunpunt WSE (Werk en
Social Economy) in 2011, the average would be even lower, since it reaches
only 32.5 ans89.

financial consequences in terms of the various statutory pension schemes, social security schemes

Note that in both cases, the number of career years takes both into account years worked and
assimilated years (not worked but taken into account for calculating the pension). 32.5 years highlighted by the
Steunpunt WSE thus divided between 22.9 years and 9.6 years of work "assimilated."

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter OLDER AND PENSIONS - p. 6/25

In this context, Ecolo recalls its opposition to any attempt to lengthen careers beyond
65. It should accompany this against lengthening careers before 65
years under good working conditions, taking account of the arduous nature of each function and
the evolving capacities and needs of workers.

Proposal: Establish a tandem plan to share the time between
young and old workers and ensure the transmission of knowledge
To meet jointly the issues of adaptation of the careers of older workers, the
transmitting their experience and the employment of younger workers, Ecolo
proposes to share the time between young workers and older workers across
privé10 sector.
The proposal, which joined the extent of retirement planning called "Tandem Plan"
in the non-profit sector, is intended to enable the worker age 55 or older (50 years or
more for heavier duties) to reduce their working hours up to a mitemps, being replaced as part of a part-time contract, a worker under 30
years. The older worker provides tutoring mission within the company retains its rights
for pensions and receive a salary equivalent to at least 75% of net salary on time
full in case of half-time passage (and at least 80% when switching to 3/5 time).
This Plan is self-funded through savings in social security and by employers
in the employment of young workers set. It is managed by the security fund and existence
sector.

Proposal: Opting for an approach careers and departure to the pension
according to the "life cycle"
Today, workers are not usually occupied from 20 to 65 in the same
employer. Careers are less linear: workers often change
employers, workplace, status ... In the same career, it is not uncommon for a
worker is independent tower tower, employee, official (sometimes simultaneously).
Moreover, workers often adapt their working time, by choice or obligation to
to take care of their families, forming, blow, because they have lost their jobs because
they are sick ...
In this context, Ecolo advocates policies that take better account of the "cycle of
life "of citizens and career development. This is to implement policies that
integrate the whole career, the transition between the life time, the management of the end of
career and the departure to the pension, by implementing flexible enough for devices
they can adapt to the citizens lifestyle choices.
Specifically, and as part of this approach, Ecolo calls for:

that the political debate on the pension decision (early or not) does not focus

those who came later on the labor market;
taking account of the arduous career. Should be taken into account

taking account of the difference between the legal age (65 years) and the actual age at

Access to the end of career. For example, the number of invalid grew strongly while
we retreated access to early retirement. In addition, an older worker needs more
recovery time after a work accident and eight times the risk of having a
mortal accident at work than younger workers;
that in the present state of things, the work after 65 remains valid for the
calculating the pension if the worker has not yet taken his pension.

Proposal: Encourage companies with more than 50 workers to increase
their efforts in training and meet the age structure of their personnel
in their training efforts
Analysis of the Investigation Task Forces conducted by the Central Council of Economie13
shows that among the different types of discrimination in access to training, is the fact that
training are more accessible to under 45 years old. But these
discriminations generate a waste of economic opportunities for businesses and
weakening of workers, particularly those exposed to international competition and
technological developments. Such discrimination prevent to some extent the
older workers to continue participating in the labor market, since these are more
often overlooked by businesses, including lack of appropriate further training.
Ecolo proposes to remedy such discrimination by ensuring that training efforts
companies respect the age structure of their personnel14.

Proposal: To facilitate the adaptation of jobs to workers

therefore appropriate to reorganize work based on the numerous examples (in Germany
in particular) that highlight the effectiveness of measures to adapt working conditions
within companies. Ecolo proposed that in all more than 50 workers, the
worker age 55 or older can petition the Committee for Prevention and
Protection at work, to be awarded within the company a suitable job which takes
consider its faculties of work16. The worker for whom the switch to a workstation
adapted causes loss of income received, in addition, the possibility to benefit from a premium
move to an adapted workstation. When adapting a workstation causes
financial investment, the company concerned may apply for subsidies to the Fund
professional experience.

Proposal: Adapting the plan for the employment of older workers to the
make it more complete and concrete
Ecolo proposes to complete the plan for the employment of workers to contain âgés17
also measures related to the transmission of knowledge, skills and development
tutoring. It should also set numerical targets for maintaining employment or
increasing the number of older workers and adopt specific proposals for
category of workers aged 55 and plus18.

Proposal: Transforming year-end bonuses holidays
Additional
The Pact between Generations planned to introduce the possibility for older workers
converting the end-of-year bonus in additional vacation days. This provision is
never entered into force.
Ecolo intends to implement the decision since, for some workers, increase its
standing time or time "for itself" is more important increase its purchasing power.
An end bonus full year is expected to represent about twenty days off
additional.

PRIORITY 3: GIVING PRIORITY TO PENSION TO ENSURING LEGAL
INCOME ELDERLY ALLOW THEM TO LIVE IN DIGNITY
ENSURING THE CREDIBILITY OF THE FIRST PILLAR
Gradually, the statutory pension provision is limited in most cases to ensure protection
based. So now, the legal average pension is 1,123 euros gross per month after
career as an employee, to 813 euros after an independent career in 1049 in the euro
If a career "mixed" independent and employee and 2426 euros in the case of a career
in the public service. We can see, there are great inequalities between pensioners and

Figures show that older workers are eight times more likely to have a fatal accident at work than
younger worker. Moreover, regarding non-fatal accidents at work, it is clear that 16.7%
labor accidents that have affected the portion of 60 years and older, resulted in permanent disabilities, against 6
% For the age group 20-29 years. Finally, at the level of incapacity for work, the Scientific Society of Occupational Health and
Scientific Association of Insurance Medicine denounce the increasing number of working long-term disabilities
falling to charge the sickness and invalidity insurance and the difficulties encountered by the workers concerned to resume
work.

A bill (53K2306) was filed in this regard.

A bill (53K23068) was filed in this regard.

pensioners of "sectors" different. Such inequalities also exist between men and
women, according to the starting time for the pension.
Many legal pensions are currently too low to live in dignity.
17% of pensioners and pensioners and live below the poverty line, with less than 1000
euros for a single (more women than men, although this difference tends to decrease
since 2003). Meanwhile, prices constantly increasing, leading to increasingly
dramatic situations, unworthy of a modern society. For comparison, the percentage
pensioners below the poverty threshold is higher in our country than in countries
Boundary: 14% in Germany, 8.3% in France and 6.4% in the Netherlands.
The proposals carried by Ecolo on pensions aimed equality between all workers
regardless of their professional status.

Proposal: Ensure structural funding solidarity and pensions
The voltage at which the budget is subject pillar "pensions" of Social Security and
expenditure forecasts for the future lead some political representatives to devise a
balance that would be built on the linear spending limits or only efforts
workers. This is a dead end that can only lead to an increase of the phenomena
poverty among seniors.
That is why the first priority is to ensure structural funding
sufficient solidarity and pensions. This consideration obviously applies to all
public policies but more particularly for pensions, given the growing importance
that represent pension spending.
To this end, as previously mentioned, it is necessary to activate various levers, whether a
best contribution of capital, including speculative, financing functions
collective and solidarité19, a more effective fight against tax fraud or a
increasing the employment rate, especially for seniors.
Belgium is committed in the framework of the objectives of Europe 2020, to be achieved by
that date an employment rate of 50% for those aged 55-64 (against 35.9% at present). But we
know that the participation of over 50 workers in the labor market requires
development of a coherent approach involving the whole career, the transition between
life time, managing the end of their career and the departure to the board (see below). The question of
"Work longer" does indeed find an adequate response if the question of
"Work differently" is posed and treated simultaneously.

Proposal: To harmonize and upgrade the minimum pension, to review access
minimum pension and upgrade the minimum right per career year
For Ecolo, the urgency is also the revaluation of the smallest pensions, including
women, indépendants20 and older beneficiaries. It is therefore necessary to harmonize and
to raise minimum pensions, both employees and mixed careers as independent in
at least 1200 per month (with respect to isolated) for a complete career.
In addition, Ecolo intends to review the conditions of access to the minimum pension. Today, it
is accessible only worker with 30 years of career up to 208 days per year. This
measure discriminates against part-time workers. Consideration should be given, for example,
the granting of a right to minimum pension proportionally according to the schedule provides.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter OLDER AND PENSIONS - p. 10/25

For Ecolo it should also reduce the gap between the lowest pensions and some
very high public pensions (Ministers, Governors, top managers ...).

Proposal: A sustainable and, if necessary, the development of
equivalent periods for pension calculation
For Ecolo, maintaining existantes21 assimilation (or even the development of such periods if
new rights are created, for example to address career development) in
calculating pensions is essential. There are indeed good reasons for the existence of these periods
treated as periods of work when calculating pensions. Job seekers, for
example, should not be punished twice: once today because they do not have
employment and have to settle for a replacement income and again tomorrow because
they lose pension rights. The same reasoning applies to assimilations if
parental leave or if time credit: When encourages people to take
more responsibility for the care of children or seniors, or are encouraged to

to employment by ensuring their replacement.
Note also that because women use, by choice or by coercion, more
than men to career breaks, even partial, of a questioning
such assimilation would mean even dig deeper inequalities between men and
women's pension.

Proposal: Take into account the gender dimension in the debate on
pensions
The gender dimension is all too rarely considered in debates on the
pensions. However, except for statutory public servants, the differences between
statutory pensions of men and women, both for employees and for self,
are very important. Thus, by way of example, in married couples benefiting from two
pensions, average man receives a monthly pension of 948 euros and a woman
pension 639 euros. These figures notably explained by the wage gap between men and
the women.
Furthermore, many forms of discrimination exist in the supplementary pension. There
half of male employees are insured against third group of
workers. The higher the income the first pension pillar, the higher the proportion of retirees
Access to the 2nd pillar increases. However, only a limited number of retired women up to
categories of highest income, which is the access level generally 2nd pillar
low. Furthermore, the amounts granted under the 2nd pillar are on average lower
for women who benefit than for men.
In this context, Ecolo offers, particularly at the level of statutory pensions:
identify measures to erase the wage differences between inexplicable
men and women and to propose their implementation, so that the amounts of
pro-deserved pension experiencing the same trend;
to review the policy of assimilation (periods of professional inactivity considered
in the calculation of pensions) to less penalizing certain "choice" of life, in reality
often suffered, women (involuntary part-time; excluding unemployed
cohabitant ...).

21

Certain periods in which the future pensioner did not work, can be assimilated. This means that these
periods are recognized in the pension calculation.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter OLDER AND PENSIONS - p. 11/25

More broadly, Ecolo also intends to phase in a process
individualisation of rights to social security, while ensuring the maintenance of
rights currently granted.

Proposal: Improve the functioning of the Revenue Guarantee
Elderly (GRAPA)
For those whose pension would remain below the poverty line despite
proposals mentioned above, Ecolo proposed that the right to GRAPA be individualized and that its
amount is structurally worn above the poverty line.
Ecolo also hopes that the opening of the right to GRAPA is automatic. Currently, there
do not routinely check whether people with low pension are also entitled to or not
GRAPA. Similarly, there is no automatic verification of rights to the situation when GRAPA
family or income of the pensioner evolve. Ecolo offers, in line proposals
the Ombudsman for pensions, a review of the right to GRAPA be performed at least every
five years for all pensioners and pensioners. Finally, proposes to allow Ecolo
GRAPA beneficiaries to leave the national territory for a period of 90 days.

Proposal: Linking full pension welfare, beginning with
lowest
For Ecolo, we also urgently restore the link pensions to wage developments
workers, so that the gap continues to widen between pensions and wages
perceived by workers. It is imperative to recover the delays in the matter. A mechanism has
was introduced some years ago for partial financing of the link of pensions
welfare. But besides the fact that this device does not fill the gap that has developed since
the early 80s or fully fund this connection, the outgoing federal government
decided to reduce by 40% the envelope welfare in 2013 and 2014.
Ecolo therefore proposes the reinstatement of 100% of that envelope and its priority use
adapting the oldest and lowest pensions.
In the longer term, the revaluation Ecolo offers average statutory pensions by consolidating
1st pillar and, for example, by changing the method of calculating statutory pensions.

Proposal: Establish minimum European standards
pensions
To move from a logic of competition to the logic of social cooperation, the
Environmentalists consider essential the establishment of European minimum standards
common for pension rights (modulated between Member States depending on
Cost of life). These standards should promote a gradual upward harmonization and
the portability of rights in order to avoid penalizing labor mobility within the Union.
A wide Europe22, it is also essential that first pillar pensions are
brought above the poverty line, universally accessible and guarantors of justice
social. The collective or individual savings made under the second and third pillars
must be better regulated and oriented and can not under any circumstances be a substitute for
universal state pension.

22

The European Green family has expressed in November 2012 its vision of pension policy: http://www.greensefa.eu/fr/pensions-8524.html

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter OLDER AND PENSIONS - p. 12/25

Proposal: Provide better information on pensions
Ecolo wants everyone to have easier access to information on human rights
pension he has made and the impact of reforms in this area on future years
work. With changing careers, workers may have more autonomy and
responsibilities than in the past. It is appropriate in this context to give them more
information on the rights they have acquired as and when their careers and their
help to understand the mechanism of calculation and maintenance of rights.

PRIORITY 4: THE 2ND AND 3RD PRESERVE PILLARS PENSION SPECULATION
GUIDE TO THEIR INVESTMENTS AND FINANCING ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES
SUSTAINABLE AND CLOSE
It should be noted that funded pension systems reinforce inequalities. These are the
Workers who receive better pensions through the first pillar, which also benefit the most
often significant income via the 2nd and / or 3rd pillar. This is what some call the effect
Mathieu. By cons, some sectors (not including merchant), certain types of work (including
temporary work or service vouchers) or individuals (mainly women
incomplete or regularly interrupted careers) do not have the same opportunity as other
contribute through these complementary funded pensions. Today, more than 40%
employees and workers are still excluded from this system.
Pensions built through the 2nd and 3rd pillars are also less safe. The financial crisis we
have known and enduring shows how this type of investment can be adventurous.
In addition, these funds are involved in the financialization of the economy, which he had seen the
serious consequences, both in the context of the financial crisis in the context of decisions
painful relocation of businesses, nourished only by the search for profits
MFR.
Given these difficulties, Ecolo considers it necessary to tag more such devices.

Proposal: Directing a portion of funds the 2nd and 3rd pillars towards
sustainable and ethical investments and improve the regulatory and supervisory framework
2nd pillar
Ecolo longstanding calls for better regulation and orientation of investments made by
these pension funds today are too often subject to speculative games and disruptors
the labor market. Prudential rules should be adopted and referral criteria
investment, particularly to the sustainable and solidarity sectors such as social economy,
should be established. Ecolo wanting to fill tax advantages which benefit
investment in pension funds 2nd and 3rd pillars, as well as the investments made by
the Silver Fund, with requirements for stability of investments,
ethics and sustainable development.
Ecolo also proposes to consolidate the pension funds 'public' (aging funds, 2nd
managed pillar under the National Pensions Office ...) in a fund that should souverain23
be used to support innovative and sustainable projects, since it is essential that
government lead by example and that the financing needs are huge.

23

Financial investment fund held by the state and invested in various investments (stocks, bonds ...).

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter OLDER AND PENSIONS - p. 13/25

Proposal: Make the most solidarity can cap
When a second pillar funded pension is set up for a category of workers,
by need or opportunity (instead of wage benefits in certain sectors), it is
ensure that it is as integral as possible (between high and low wages and a larger base
possible). Ecolo proposes in this context to focus most advantageous taxation for the
pension obligations Pillar 2 which contain a strong solidarity component. Aspects
Although solidarity already exist in certain pension plans (the so-called social plan).
However, Ecolo, these solidarity criteria should be greatly strengthened.

PRIORITY 5: PROVIDE A PLACE OF LIFE TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS AINE PROJECT
Among the challenges raised by lengthening the service life, there is one very essential to
Ecolo eyes: that of housing. Very many elderly are forced to
give up their autonomy due to habitat became unsuitable to the constraints imposed by the
aging. The physical characteristics of the habitat are inadequate or isolation became
too important. It is therefore essential to promote and support new forms of
design oriented housing on the evolution of the habitat and its reconfiguration over the periods
of life. The federated entities will ensure the future to develop and diversify the offer while
integrating it into a wider policy of Senior Citizens in order to meet the
diversity of needs expressed by them.

Proposal: Extend the housing supply, diversify and promote access to
propriété24
Ecolo proposed to support the development of different forms of housing to expand the offer
and respond adequately to the needs of the elderly:
social services serviced residences and residences offer housing and
services tailored to the elderly, while allowing home care for
people with loss of autonomy. It should be supported through programs
regional investment;
the "intergenerational projects" for housing or community both
singles and families, ages and diversified revenues, to make them
rub in the same building. The same investment programs would
mobilized to do this and Conversion of nursing homes that no longer meet
the profitability thresholds for such infrastructure could be envisaged to this
end. In this community perspective, kots for students sharing a house
person or an elderly couple also constitute a solution to the housing need
for students;
needs housing and adaptable to the needs of the elderly, including
enforcing the legislation in force for both the public and the private;
housing development "kangaroo" modular housing according to individual steps
the life of the household occupies. As a young couple can occupy the floor of a dwelling,
eg leaving the ground floor to an elderly person. This requires provision
from building design modulation of dwellings within the building. She
allows each party withdraws a profit due to live together. To this end, there are
a social mortgage form with the Housing Fund. It must be
complemented on housing that does not require transformations, by a

Chapter "Housing".

labeling managed by a Housing Promotion Association. Beyond the support
brick, it is also appropriate to settle definitively the federal
criminalization of solidarity housing and its negative financial impact on the income of
persons receiving income replacement;
habitat solidarity between older people who decide to live together, such as
Abbeyfield in Walloon Brabant. These include providing support mounting
projects, financial and legal aspects are often prohibitive and make
provision of land or public buildings are to develop this kind of project,
in the context of municipal anchoring programs.
Furthermore, in order not to penalize the growing number of people who choose the
Housing solidarity as habitat kangaroo, intergenerational or grouped, Ecolo offers
sociaux25 the individualisation of rights.
Finally, being a homeowner is an important part of security
of existence, especially when reaching the pension age. Seniors who own a
housing, particularly if it is well insulated and equipped, saving as much rent costs and
thus have a stronger capital investment potential financial risk.
Invest in the purchase of his own home is therefore a decision that should be encouraged by
tax incentives, bonuses or by soft loans, taking into account income
taxpayers concerned, to support poor families, energy efficiency
buildings, built to promote a little consumer or totally autonomous in terms
energy, the location, to promote densification of the habitat. These aid policies to the
construction or acquisition of housing effective energy-also contribute
the development of the activity in the construction sector, economic sector by definition
just relocated. Therefore Ecolo proposes encouraging, in a targeted manner, access to
propriété26.

Proposal: Strengthen the home help services
Although widely grown, home assistance is still insufficient to meet today
challenges related to aging. This form of support helps seniors maintain a decent life and
independently at home. It therefore avoids the premature use of structures
hosting, which uproots and is a major cost for both seniors - Pension
is sometimes completely engulfed in the accommodation price - and the community.
Furthermore, home help is needed to help aging people retain
decent living conditions and positive for their physical and mental health.
Ecolo calls for a strengthening of home care services, improved
training of stakeholders, including diversity issues, and their conditions
work (see below).
Local services must be able to integrate into their work network practices
allow to work in partnership with other social actors, to maintain
relational abilities of people with their social environment and that identify and
people who suffer isolation.
Finally, it is important that close and complementary relationships are organized between aid services and
home care services qu'Ecolo renforcer27 also wishes to meet both
needs of the elderly and the permanent orientation towards hospitalization stays
ever shorter.

Proposal: To improve qualitatively and quantitatively the host offer
nursing home and rest home and care
When it is no longer possible to stay at home even by supporting caregivers or
specialized services, many elderly people are choosing to live in rest homes
(MR), or if their health deteriorates or dependence, in rest homes and care
(MRS).
Given demographic changes, demand for reception places in this type of structure
Permanent rose sharply. While giving priority to policies allowing
home care, should be able to respond via sufficient and decentralized supply,
to allow a home near his former place of life and preserve links
family and quality. This requires increased public support, with a corresponding
strict conditionality regarding the affordability and quality of care.
Meet this need by MR - MRS is organized in connection with the evolution of structures
hospital beds, some of which could be converted for the care of people
elderly requiring non acute care, this in a less medicalized framework.
In a context of ever increasing commodification of these places of welcome and pressure
on workers, should also be particularly attentive to the quality of the welcome and
of living in a rest home.
In this context, it should include:
to ensure initial and ongoing training, as well as its conditions
work ;
to ensure the training of leaders of these institutions not only in management
financial but also in human resources management and relational dynamics;
ensure a diversified leisure offer for residents to increase participation in
nursing home residents and participation in outdoor activities;
to respect the coaching standards by qualified personnel;
to ensure the quality (diversity, taste ...), dietary habits (or the prescribed
religious), and the nutritional balance of meals provided;
to ensure compliance of residents and their choices;
to ensure compliance of family and social ties residents but relationally
also in the development of private and collective spaces of these institutions and
respect the emotional and sexual lives of residents;
strengthen the conditions for reception and control on the prices of the houses
rest.

Proposal: Provide one-time home places
When the loss of autonomy is scalable and even if it does not require the use of care
residential, one-time home of places for people with reduced autonomy should be offered
Family and / or relatives (see below, proposal relating to caregivers). This is so
allow them to breathe, to maintain a professional activity or maintain their
Social links. Such places should also help to avoid too rapid entry into service
residential, with the personal and collective costs involved.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter OLDER AND PENSIONS - p. 16/25

Ecolo therefore proposes more support shelters and day centers
specialized in one-time reception of persons in loss of autonomy, face difficulties
temporary or revalidation28 and develop their capacities.

Proposal: Fight against elder abuse
The elder abuse, particularly when they are losing their autonomy is
a disturbing reality that can take many forms: physical, psychological,
moral, material or financial abuse.
Various specific public responses are needed. Ecolo proposed development
awareness and information campaigns, training and coaching people in
charge of the reception of dependent people (in institutions and at home), improved
living conditions of residents and the opening of nursing homes outward, supporting
listening and support services, and finally, the effective implementation of sanctions in the case of
proven abuse.
The recognition and subsidizing of support groups for caregivers qu'Ecolo
advocates also address this concern, the permanent care of a person
a dependent family member is sometimes so heavy that the risks of
Abuse can find favored. In recognition of caregivers, Ecolo
and proposes that they be accompanied by a recognized association.

Proposal: Take into account the diversity of older people and their lives
emotional and sexual
The fight against child abuse also involves taking into account the diversity of seniors. The
needs of older people converge in many respects as the issue of housing,
listening or recognition. However it is necessary to take into account the
specifics of an immigrant population in terms of language, cultural code or
religion. The realities of older people from the first and second generation
Immigration must be specifically apprehended. In very many cases, it is
Senior poorly educated, poorly informed and weakened our health care system. At the age of retirement, he
Sometimes the return home, long considered, only proves more feasible for many
reasons, a situation that can be very badly lived. In addition, some immigrant women
are particularly isolated, especially when the spouse's death occurs or
possible deterioration in their health. They find themselves without contact with the outside,
who have never worked and often not mastering a national language. A better
taking into account the needs of elderly immigrant is needed to
they enjoy the same services as other seniors.
Finally, Ecolo has taken into account the emotional and sexual life of older persons,
including the diversity of sexual orientation, taking into account almost non-existent today
suffering still taboo. Yet, loneliness, emotional needs and sexual desire good
actual often prove difficult to live for an elderly person living in institutions. This is
also a concern for professional or home environment.
These difficult questions, few if not addressed, deserve to be heard, considered and debated
to find solutions, especially in the context of initial and continuing training
stakeholders.

28

These include short-stay places in nursing homes.

PRIORITY 6: IMPROVE THE LIVING HOPE HEALTHY
The health of the elderly is a major concern that must guide both the
health policies throughout life, welfare policies and policies at work
education, prevention and health education.
In this context, Ecolo door proposals on measures for aging well, for
Prepare for this stage of life that is the pension and provide the best support for seniors
with diseases related to aging.

Proposal: To promote a global research in the fight against
age-related diseases
Since 2011 in Belgium, we live on average more than 80 years. If medical progress and
prevention are real regarding cardiovascular diseases and in the field of
the fight against cancer, they are less so with regard to neurodegenerative diseases.
Health and the lengthening of the duration and quality of life are two of the priority themes
2011-2015 research driven strategy Ecolo in Wallonia-Brussels and
Wallonia. Ecolo wants to strengthen this support, starting with the most complex areas
such as Alzheimer's disease and cancers.
Regarding pharmaceutical research, Ecolo proposes to broaden the range of people tested. In
Indeed, for the moment, new drugs are tested on subjects aged 18-70 years. The
Older people should come more often in studies, given their
plurimédication and different metabolism. Not to mention they are often targeted by patients
new treatments on the market.
Ecolo also wants to promote a comprehensive research on aging is limited
medical research but not extending, among others, and relational aspects
communication and life dominating factors in aging. Research
would aim in particular to:
detection and prevention of risk factors associated with aging such as going to the
retirement, isolation;
limit the risk factors that affect healthy life;
promote the proper use of medications and develop specific management tools
the plurimédication, aimed in particular taking into account the interactions between
drugs;
better manage the problems related to aging such as dementia
and Alzheimer's disease;
offer the most appropriate training for stakeholders in the care sector
Seniors.
This research should be for the benefit of people and improving their well-being so
Independent financial interests of economic players in the pharmaceutical sector. Ecolo
offers important steps to foster this independence of research through
its health program.

Proposal: To detect and prevent risk factors associated with aging
during retirement
In a society where professional involvement and activity often constitute landmarks
identity and important guarantees of success, the start of working life, even after

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter OLDER AND PENSIONS - p. 18/25

a busy and successful career transition is not always easy to grasp.
A new balance must be found, taking into account changes in physical capacity when
The retirement is not also synonymous with health problems early.
Thus, it is necessary, with a view to prevention, seniors and elders are informed,
supported and encouraged to find and maintain their balance, boosting their capacities and
rewarding experiences.
The duo plan proposed by Ecolo in the end also offers a professional career
device which allows to move towards the pension while remaining competent and passer knowledge and
know-how.
In this context, Ecolo also offers:

that occupational medicine develops tools to promote the transition from life
professional and retirement (by preparatory sessions for those who
wish, for example);
enhance the role of the general practitioner prevention in the regular monitoring of
Pensioners and take advantage of this transition to establish a healthy balance sheet
repaid to adapt their lifestyle to the changes of life and
rhythms.

Proposal: To prevent the risk factors that influence the quality of life
Ecolo offers include:
promote the practice of adapted physical activities and sport for senior citizens;
the fight against obesity "young seniors" often due to lack of activity and
mobility and malnutrition in the elderly. It is appropriate to adopt specific measures
for better nutrition for older people (consider the worst
ingestion of proteins, provide a suitable menu in the institutions ...) and ensure
information professionals do not always detect undernutrition situations;
to take steps to reduce air pollution and especially
levels of fine particles, particularly vital issue for most people
âgées29;
to promote and encourage healthy eating in communities kitchens,
including nursing homes;
take better care of locomotor disabilities linked to conditions such as
osteoporosis and osteoarthritis amplifying information as to their prevention and
treatment;
to better prevent falls by arranging living spaces (one level, without
barriers ...), better support people and promoting the use and
improving electronic devices to warn in case of fall or
of damage to vital functions;
next to the comprehensive care of the elderly by their GP,
amplify the information on public campaigns cancer free screening
within which Ecolo proposes to extend free beyond the current age, and future
Cancer screening programs for cervical and colorectal cancer;
improve oral health by setting up a free consultation to 65
years.

Proposal: To promote proper use of medicines
The legitimate desire to live longer and better is accompanied by an anarchic proliferation
antiaging medicine, often inspired by economic interests. These medicines
include hormone replacement therapies, vitamin cocktails or herbal
sometimes very controversial. Some of them escape, via the Internet or medical tourism,
controls.
For Ecolo, in a public health concern, it is necessary to better define the real interest
products and substances, to clarify the potential risks and especially to better study
opportunities for new therapeutic treatments. Furthermore, measures should be
planned to make them useful therapies accessible to all and not only to more
Easy. Finally, Ecolo supports concerted action with the objective of helping doctors
avoid unnecessary prescriptions, to better reflect the negative interactions
prescribed drugs, promoting treatments that cause a life in good health longer
and to promote adherence to treatment.
These are the last years of life that generate the most significant health costs,
improving healthy life reduces the collective and individual spending on health care
health.
Relations between general practitioners, home care stakeholders and home help are here
essential to ensure a comprehensive approach of the person while maintaining its role it
central actor and subject.

Proposal: Develop policies to promote physical and mental activity
of Senior Citizens
This objective is part of the European increase of life expectancy in good health objective
two years. The information including statistics about life expectancy in good
health must be improved to the Belgian and European levels.
The relationship between the practice of physical activity and maintaining a good quality of life have
been demonstrated. The advantage of practicing regular physical activity or sports for a
person over 60 years is twofold and important: improving the quality of life,
remain independent as long as possible and limit the functional and cognitive decline.
Any physical activity should be practiced in good conditions and especially with
trained responders to the specificities of Senior Citizens. The activity can be carried out under
recognized sports or softer and adapted activities. Ecolo proposes to promote
practice of regular sporting activity with the elderly and within
host institutions.

Proposal: Better take care of disoriented people
Senile dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease, is a major challenge for
our societies, especially those where the population ages, as in Europe and Japan.
Now estimated at 160,000 the number of people with dementia in Belgium, which
85 000 Alzheimer's disease.
Flanders has since 2003 established a reference center and centers of expertise in this
field, which are responsible for providing information to patients and their families,
coordinate training, specialized agencies of the statement ...
Ecolo hope that this challenge is addressed by combining the various entities involved in their
complementary skills. It is indeed both to improve information and participation
patients and their relatives; improve treatment and supported; and finally
combining observations and analyzes to improve prevention in the development of

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter OLDER AND PENSIONS - p. 20/25

these diseases, for which environmental causes are more and more often
identified.
The consultation tool of Joint Interministerial Conference on Health and Environment (TOPS)
could develop a coordinated plan of action.

PRIORITY 7: SUPPORTING FAMILIES AND RELATIVES OF PEOPLE
DEPENDENT

Proposal: To support the caregiver or caregiver proche30
While the number of dependents (disabled, elderly ...) is
constantly increasing, the function of helping close benefits neither recognition nor
support in Belgium. This function is however an increased burden on families,
close that lead also a social, professional and cultural.
So that the function of helping close becomes a free choice, it is necessary to act at several levels:
Extend the home aid offer and the home offers people in great situation
dependence ;
More accessible external assistance at home, both materially and
financially;
Give proper recognition and status to the caregiver or the caregiver and his
role ;
Supporting associations support caregivers.
Indeed, home care a person requires great dependence
availability and therefore often leads to a career break and, therefore, a
decrease in household income and a loss of professional and social relationships.
Even for a fixed period, such a risk of accompaniment system output
protection of labor and loss of rights, mainly due to the lack of recognition
such situations.
To address such situations and prevent physical exhaustion, moral and financial of
caregivers, Ecolo intends to establish a legal framework that recognizes the caregiver status close. It's about
and to open similar rights to parental leave, to give flexibility at work,
assimilation of the past period with the closest in the calculation of the pension and enable
Job Search exemption during that period, if the relative is helping unemployed.
Ecolo also offers a dependent person may be assisted by two helpers in time
part to allow caregivers to keep the professional relationship and therefore social, and to
better share the role of men and women knowing that it is now taken by 90%
women.
Finally, Ecolo insists that people helped and caregivers are accompanied by service
specialized support in order to always have the presence, assistance, moments of
reflection, necessary training and cropping. Indeed, the caregiver helping relationship is a relationship
difficult which requires much time and energy. The risks of abuse and suffering
both for the person being cared for helping are significant and must be anticipated.

30

The proposal for the recognition and support to help close an elderly person is the same as
proposal to help close a disabled person (see Chapter "Handicapped"), needs
being the same.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter OLDER AND PENSIONS - p. 21/25

Proposal: To better coordinate the work of support services and that of carers
close
Increased aid organized via formal home care services does not cause
not necessarily a decrease in informal care provided by family members, the
or neighborhood friends. These are two complementary forms of assistance; Joint Support is often
a stimulus to the caregiver, it can be lived more calmly and better organized.
However, especially for the well-being of people, it is important that proper coordination is
place between the services concerned, caregivers and the elderly person.
Such coordination31 must allow such:
better information of both sides;
sharing related tasks, instrumental tasks being more supported
by professionals while the emotional and relational aspects are filled by
family and relatives;
establishing a partnership between the elderly, caregivers and formal caregivers
informal.

8 PRIORITY: SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS SECTOR
Proposal: Oversee and support the emergence of new métiers32
Demographic change and aging population lead to the emergence of a number
substantial new business in response to the demands and new needs. This applies
accompaniment and home care, health, assisted living, recreation,
studies and specific learning, sport activities ...
There is a great challenge for these new trades attractive business, exercised
in the social, financial and statutory interest. They must be valued, be
accessible through specific training, serious, properly framed, and favor the
multidisciplinary work in teams in networks, multiple collaborations.
Health professionals specializing in geriatrics are in short supply, it is necessary to upgrade these
specializations within the healthcare professionals and through modes of financing
hospitals and soins33.

Proposal: Improve working conditions for accompaniment
quality
In rest homes as in any institution, the atmosphere and coaching people
highly dependent on the management mode that is assured, the relationship that may have knotted
between workers and residents and thus working conditions.
Now it is common that staff do not feel recognized in terms of wages and the load
work to which the teams are facing always proves more heavy and difficult to the point of
not being able to bring the share of inherent humanity at work. Benefits are reduced to

31

A pilot project is underway in Brussels Region at the initiative of the Minister of Assistance to persons:
http://www.dionysos.pro/FR/index.html
32
The proposal for the regulation of new professions related to aging is identical to the proposal
in the disability sector, facing the same realities, see 'Disability'.
33
For more information on the proposed Ecolo on this, see Chapter "Health".

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter OLDER AND PENSIONS - p. 22/25

Indeed more and more to a succession of technical acts to the detriment of ties that actors
field can establish with the seniors.
Obviously qu'Ecolo is in favor of projects bearing dynamics, openness to the world
outside, taking account of the individual as actor of his life. Therefore clarification
the role and tasks of stakeholders is required, which in particular through the creation or
the valuation of new functions such as coaching, counseling or
administrative help seniors. The goal is to move from an institutional logic oriented
technical documents to a relational logic with resident persons. It needs
necessarily review time management and staff, to organize interventions so
global and interactive and a salary increase of these trades.
In this context, the Plan Tandem established in the non-profit sector under the leadership of
ECOLO Government Ministers during the rainbow sky deserves support and développé34. he
allows workers aged over 50 or 55 years to reduce their working time and
to accompany a young worker hired to replace him. This is positive for both workers
concerned and for those assisted, benefiting from fewer workers services
stressed, less fatigued and better trained.

Proposal: To enhance networking services and institutions
Services and institutions that cater to seniors are facing the same challenges
coordination and exchanges between actors of a sector that most sectors of nonmarchand.
The different services of the voluntary or private sector (associations, volunteers, doctors, nurses,
hospitals, residential facilities, home care, mental health services, etc.)
intervene with seniors must strengthen coordination among themselves to improve
and make their complementary interventions.
The local level is the most appropriate level for proper coordination of actions and
increased visibilisation actions and services for the benefit of the elderly.
For its part, the regional level is the one who must both require and enable stakeholders and
services to network, integrating the inhabitants of the neighborhoods in their practices and
their working time. These conditions are necessary for the development of preventive policies
isolation and risk of elder abuse and promoting policies of social ties,
multidisciplinary, global approach and cross.

Social justice
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
An inclusive society
Status and political horizon
State of play
Citizen, citizen, mother or father, student or student, passionate enthusiast or
reading, music, crafts or sports, practicing a profession, a social activity or
hobby ... the person with disability, like any other member of society,
recognizes, lives and comes across many qualifications among which the
Disability is not, generally, neither the first nor the principal of its peculiarities.
The wish of a majority of disabled people is simply to participate in social life,
cultural and economic as well as any other citizen, to the extent of its
capabilities.
Disability refers first to the solidarity that the company has to implement in respect of
any person to allow him to be actress in society and realize, to match its
means and according to his desire, his personal life project. This is a vital mission
community and public authorities to ensure that this solidarity can be deployed through
physical responses, economic, cultural and social efficient, meeting the needs
specific and legitimate aspirations of disabled people and their families.
Such a policy must be deployed in a particular context, marked in particular by:
the positive evolution of life expectancy of people with disabilities need to invent
new answers to the needs of aging people with disabilities;
segmentation of the institutional landscape in several entities: the INAMI and the Public Service
Federal disability (called the "Black Madonna"), AWIPH (Walloon Agency for the integration of
disabled person), the Office of the DG for People
Disabilities1 or PHARE Service (for Francophone Brussels, at the Cocof)
and COCOM (for bilingual Brussels institutions);
the lack of places in specialized institutions for people with severe
disability and dependency needs, requiring the continuous presence of a
third party ;
the necessary dialogue but almost non-existent among many services, cells,
associations or persons (CPAS, mutual societies, hospitals, providing care to independent
home, assisted living ...) that are used in daily life
disabled, which results in a parceled approach to the situation, a
dispersion of energies or sterile competition.
It is therefore to show determination, common sense and creativity to play this
necessary solidarity as much as possible and improve the welfare of many citizens.

An inclusive approach
Eco considering disability according to an inclusive approach, also advocated within the
UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and embodied in the
all new decree on the inclusion of persons with disabilities adopted by the Cocof to
Bruxelles2:
a "global" approach to disability: the physical, sensory or mental
a person becomes a handicap that insofar as the environment of
person is not suitable for this deficiency. This is not only to people
disabilities to adapt to their environment, it is as much the latter who should be
adapted ;
an approach in terms of rights: the disabled person is a citizen or
citizen to whom society recognizes and guarantees the same rights as any other person.
This requires, among other equal access to services offered by the State to
population and equal treatment. This also requires the right to self-determination: the disabled person has the right to participate fully in society and
to choose between the use, subject to possible adjustments, the same services and
institutions that the rest of the population (the "General Services") or to services
specialized;
a transversal approach: it implies that all policies are designed
so that every citizen, disabled or not, can benefit. All
areas of society are concerned, all governments have the responsibility.
The wish of a majority of persons with disabilities is to participate in social life,
cultural and economic as well as any other citizen.
To do this, governments should strive for an individualized relationship with the person
disabled and relatives, for a systemic response to their needs (material aid or
financial, support devices, support or assistance) and allow it to have
livelihoods that compensate for the costs generated by disability.
Develop a policy of inclusion entails having a wide range of solutions for
best meet each person in the singularity of its needs and capabilities. These
Solutions must be developed as part of life (public services, leisure, culture, sport ...), the
regular educational and professional environment (schools, universities, businesses ...) and institutions
and specialized services.
These are essential to meet the needs of some people with disabilities,
including those in dependency needs, and relieve families. To be actors
inclusion, specialized services must, too, be positioned as open places,

interact with the surrounding community, building bridges with the "ordinary" and make him
share expertise.
Beyond an individualized approach, support for people with disabilities should be a
collective programming of home needs, hosting and support, which
need to overcome as quickly as possible the current weaknesses in censuses and statistics
objectifiable data.
Finally, the inclusion should be viewed apart from any short-term fiscal logic,
sustainable investment as a source of wealth for humanity and society at
together.

2

In the Brussels Region, this inclusive approach was adopted during the last decade (managed competence
by the Minister of Ecolo Huytebroeck 2004-2014), which allowed work in the continuity and the development
and diversification of the services and assistance provided.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter DISABLED - p 2/20

The Ecolo force lines
To foster such inclusive approach in policies for people experiencing
disability, Ecolo door the following objectives:
Allow each disabled person to find a place of life adapted to his project
Placing the disabled person in government central concern to
guarantee his rights
Ensuring a decent income and access to material aid
Ensuring a society accessible to everyone, both in terms of mobility access
services
Promote participation in social, cultural and emotional people
Disabled
Making education, training and employment inclusion pathways
Supporting the families of persons with disabilities and professionals.

Priorities and policy proposals
PRIORITY 1: ENABLE EVERY PERSON TO FIND A DISABLED A PLACE
ADAPTED TO HIS LIFE PROJECT

Proposal: To support and strengthen the daily accompaniment to maintain
or develop autonomy
Whatever type of disability, more and more people with disabilities can be
supported in the various places of their daily life (the nursery, school, housing, location
work, leisure places ...) and assisted in the maintenance or development of the autonomy
widest. For thirty years, many services have emerged, both
Brussels and Wallonia, to meet individualized to the specific needs of these
persons and their relatives.
Their work is part of the inclusive approach to disability and settled in close cooperation with
people with disabilities, their family and social environment, citizens with whom they
share moments and living areas and services and environments that can host
be useful to them.
In recent years, the early assistance services, the Assistance Services and Services Integration
Accompanying received broad political support to enable them to meet the needs
an increased number of disabled people and develop new missions (haltegarderie, leisure, supportive housing, respite ...). In Wallonia, however, that support has organized
through calls for pilots without consolidation of financial means nor framework Flemish Parliament
missions performed by the support services. It is therefore appropriate to adopt a legal framework
and ensure long-term financing of these services.
It is, however, essential to continue to support those services in their development
meet the objectives of the UN Convention on the rights of persons
disabilities.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter DISABLED - p 3/20

Proposal: Expand and diversify the offer of inclusive housing, housing
accompanied and help to the daily life
Ecolo wishes to encourage the construction of individual housing adapted so that
every disabled person can choose the place of life that suits him and offer him opportunities
maximum social interaction within the normal community life, neighborhood and
neighborhood.
Thus, the "inclusive" housing must be developed to live independently while benefiting from
occasional nudges attentive and caring neighbors. Similarly, the learning
progressive autonomy can go through periods of living in supported accommodation, with
support professionals.
At the same time, it is increasing the supply of adaptable housing in housing
public via social housing agencies, social housing companies or regulated
communal land, including for large families. Ecolo also proposes encouraging
the creation of adaptable housing in the private housing by establishing a premium for
certified housing.
In addition, to avoid that suitable housing will remain empty rental demand due to lack of
disabled person and to respond individually to the needs, proposes that Ecolo
any renovation or construction of new housing is thought to allow the
Where appropriate, the easy installation of equipment necessary for handicapée3 person.
Support services to daily life (ADL) allow, in turn, to the disabled person
dependent living at home, independently, through a call system 24h / 24 to employed assistants
grouped nearby and intervening to everyday gestures that are outside of acts of
care. These services were established thanks to the mobilization of the disabled. For
Ecolo, it should strengthen the control of workers' rights and beneficiaries and
dialogue between them, in an objective of stability and safe environment. A thorough assessment
This service offering should take place. It is also necessary to review and formalize the list of acts
called "ADL".

Proposal: To meet the institutions needs places for people
the least autonomous
The scale of the needs and demands requires the creation of new spaces and new
services to meet the rights of people with dependency needs as well as
their families.
Some people can, indeed, live as if they receive aid and assistance
permed. But many families do not have access to suitable accommodation or permanent,
at least, to respite places.
Ecolo considers, therefore, that private initiatives in the form of association, must continue to be
publics4 supported by the authorities, since the birth of the project through the construction or
infrastructure development, sustainable support to the front desk or hosting
put in place. Furthermore, the exchange of experience should be facilitated and the administrative procedures
lightened as much as possible.
If public authorities have delegated to the private sector an important part of this Mission Home
and accommodation, a reflection on the feasibility of new public institutions must also be
conducted.
3
Architects and construction trades offer a training program entitled "Building and renovate
adaptability "that meets this need.
4
In Brussels, the "Decree infrastructure" of 29 October 2010 allowed the financing of a significant part of costs
construction or renovation of institutions for the disabled. It has provided a significant boost to
the opening of new day centers and accommodations.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter DISABLED - p 4/20

It should at the same time to avoid ending up in an institution for people whose
needs could be met in another manner. This can be supported by the establishment
criteria priorities in access new people to these institutions.
In this context the lack of space and the equally urgent, new needs
aging people with disabilities, a program of medium and long-term needs must
be performed. It is for that, to better understand the current situation and to get a view
overall via a centralized host applications and hosting - today
scattered at each institution - and a census of disability, particularly
dependency needs and circumstances in which solutions are lacking or
unsatisfactory. This register will allow programming that integrates current and future needs
people with disabilities.
Finally, the creativity that is required to meet the challenge of aging involves not only
a serious political will, but also of exchanges, meetings, collaborations and synergies
between institutions for disabled persons and those for older people, based on, for
eg geographical proximity, values ​​and / or collective project.

Proposal: Extend offers respite
The lack of services, hospitality and places appropriate structures transfers the load to the
families. This implies, on the part of their members, continuous availability of quality,
understanding the demands, needs and wishes of the disabled person while
care to preserve his privacy.
It is necessary for their personal balance but also to avoid the risks of abuse,
those persons to places where, in confidence, they can entrust their child,
parent, brother or sister for a moment of respite. It is a balanced and
attentive to meeting the needs of wholesome relaxation, rest for a few days or
few weeks, families with a member with disabilities, even light.
It is therefore a priority to continue to support and develop these respite opportunities.
This also requires a home or a short-term accommodation in an institution or
when licensed spaces are specifically dedicated to respite or in the temporary absence
of a user. This is why to manage as efficiently as possible availability, via
simplified administrative procedures or incentives at the level of subsidization to
to achieve an optimal occupancy rate of existing places. The Census disability
dependence and centralized reception and accommodation requests must also
afford to offer respite to those who need it first.
Finally, associations of family caregivers should also be supported so that they can
more be a privileged place of respite for families, let alone when the support is
mainly driven by the same person. This is to break the isolation, provide a place
speech, exchange and support to the latter.

Proposal: To meet the specific needs of people with dual
diagnosis
These people with the combination of a mental disability, mental illness and
behavioral disorders can lead a life in mainstream enjoying a
appropriate support.
The most effective way to meet both their life projects, their capacities and
difficulties is to network with their family and social environment but also with the
doctor, help and care services, hospital facilities and hospitality so
to support these stakeholders who do not have the habit of cohabitation between disability and
mental illness.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter DISABLED - p 5/20

To do this, the development of mobile teams (mental health worker in pairs
with a worker in the field of disability) must continue. Beyond these teams
specific, the partnership between mental health services and disability should be intensified through to
joint training, supervisions, etc. At times of crisis, it is necessary to
be accommodated in a specialized structure for short periods. Therefore Ecolo
wants respite structures (see above "Extend respite Offer") to be adapted to their
needs.
Moreover, some of these people need to live for a few months in a medium
more box of life. They can sometimes confuse us, the difficulties of understanding
may result from mental disability and cause difficulty in establishing relationships with
caregivers in psychiatric institutions and thus be sent to institutions for people
disabled due to violent behavior of way. It is therefore necessary to supplement
the current offer of structures or specialized care units, at least in Brussels.
Ecolo proposes that ad hoc funding INAMI, allowing compliance with standards, may be their
granted to the image of the specialized unit Manage driver. This unit allows the reception in case of
crisis, observation and orientation, a working plank of drives needed to prepare
person to (re) integrate an environment, etc .; it offers, in addition, an interesting support (advice,
support to the team ...) to support services and / or home for persons
disabilities, avoiding exclusions.

PRIORITY 2: PLACE THE DISABLED PERSON AT CENTRE
GOVERNMENT CONCERNS

Proposal: To ensure equal rights
Belgium has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,
which came into force in 2009. The Centre for Equal Opportunities and the fight against
Racism was responsible for monitoring its implementation, via a new service 'Rights Convention
Disability "and an accompanying commission. The challenge now is to
effectively implement the provisions of the Convention, and transversely. Since
accessibility of places to housing, work, through health or sport, all
policies must equal rights of the disabled, with the close involvement
thereof.
The challenge now is to implement the provisions of the Convention across the board:
for each policy pursued must ask in advance the question of access of everyone
the benefits that will result. Health, sports, housing, employment, accessibility of public space ...:
all spheres of living together is concerned.
To progress in this direction, Ecolo proposes that the administrations also play a
advocacy role of other jurisdictions and general services (see below).

Proposal: To public administrations person's service
Disabled
The steps required to disabled people by the INAMI, the Federal Public Service,
AWIPH, the Office of the German Community for People with Disabilities, service
PHARE and COCOM can be further facilitated and simplified, among others:
improving cooperation within administrations, between administrations and
private organizations;

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter DISABLED - p 6/20

allowing for flexibility and creativity in dynamic responses
made to persons with disabilities;
giving a central place to listen to and support for people
disabilities;
facilitating access to the administration through new communication technologies while
maintaining the dialogue to answer the questions live, interact and ensure that
Information has been included;
improving access to information on existing aid.
It should also be urgently overcome the frequent SPF handicap accessibility problems.
For example, the 0800 call number should be operational throughout the day and people
disabilities should, again, be able to send an email directly to the service
concerned. At present, they must complete a complicated form online and not suitable.
While it is important to facilitate access to the administration through new communication technologies,
Also important to maintain dialogue between people, which the question and answer dialogue, interaction and checks understanding are facilitated.
Furthermore, in connection with the transfer of mobility aid from the federal state to the federated entities,
Ecolo was animated by the constant concern not to complicate the steps people
disabilities. This transfer is now possible to concentrate in one place by the entity
requests for assistance and solutions.
Ecolo finally wants the PHARE service, the Office of the DG for
Disabled and AWIPH awareness and offer their collaboration to other
general administration and services to help them to fulfill their vis-à-vis the role of
People with Disabilities. Current obstacles sometimes fall under a single resentment that can
easily be overcome to discover that accommodate people with disabilities and integrate their
needs in the missions of services is not only desirable but also possible.

Proposal: To promote cross-cutting policies and coordinated services
a life project
Implementing such a policy inclusive, transversal and coordinated calls for
mobilization, both from the field workers as public actors. To do this, a
Permanent Inter-Ministerial Conference (IMC) exists and should ensure the cohesion,
complementarity and mutual reinforcement of the legal provisions, decrees or regulations
on aid, support, assistance or support to persons with disabilities. This
tool is underutilized. Therefore Ecolo proposes that each competent Minister may
ICD call when it comes to discussing new legislation or when collects
changes required in the cross competences between the Federal State and the federated entities.
This cross is meant both horizontal at the same entity - federal or federated
- And vertically, between different levels of power. It must also be developed within
even administrations and between local players.
The creation or continuation of places of encounter and dialogue, such as advisory boards
Brussels must allow an exchange on work methods, ethics and the ...
coordination and complementarity between the various actors in the approach to each case
particular. Sometimes, for example, that some disabled also exhibit
behavioral disorders. They are well situated at the crossroads of several areas: mental health,
social assistance, education, disability. Accordingly, several levels of power and skills
involved. It still happens too often that these people be forgotten or excluded, or
yet they are accommodated in environments not suited to their circumstances and their needs.
To remedy this, political action and field, cross and coordinated, is needed.
In this example, it may go through the recruitment of specialized staff in mental health
within regional agencies, or by human means or for specific financial services

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter DISABLED - p 7/20

hosting these people in order to ensure good coordination with the health community
mental.

PRIORITY 3: ENSURE DECENT INCOME
Proposal: Raise the income replacement allowance above the threshold
of poverty.5
Disabled people, like many people dependent on income
replacement, are increasingly forced to live in poverty, with incomes that
often fall below the poverty line or in short of € 1,000 per month.
Therefore Ecolo intends to meet all social allowances, including allowances
replacing poverty6 above the threshold.

Proposal: Individualize income replacement allowances and
Integration
Currently, it is the household income are taken into account for fixing
the income replacement allowance. The same goes for the allocation related to the loss or
reduction of autonomy. Ecolo proposes to guarantee the integration regardless allocation
income of the spouse and not to regard it as income subject to taxation. From the
when a person is necessarily dependent, it can not in fact be penalized by
a system that links to household income integration allowance. Beyond the allocation of
replacement income, whether of persons with disabilities or not,
individualisation of rights impose7.
Finally, income replacement benefits must be regarded, in their modes
calculation and granting unemployment benefits, so as to substitute for immediate
professional income when the situation of a person changes.

Proposal: To allow rapid adaptation allowances when
Disability evolves
Today, adjustment periods allowances that can benefit people
disabled as a result of changes in their situation8 are such that financial difficulties
may follow. Some people find themselves at the CPAS. By snowball effect, it
also happens that these entail stopping the support for carers and
medication.
The amount of allocation must, where appropriate, be adapted without delay as a function of
changes in the activity of the disabled person.

5
The poverty threshold is set at 60% of median income, € 1,000 / month for a single. For more information about
Ecolo proposals for raising the lowest allocations, see Chapter "Fight against poverty".
6
Ecolo has filed a bill to that effect (53K0319).
7
For more information about the proposals Ecolo regarding individualisation of rights, see Chapter "Fight
against precariousness ".
8
A change of situation can occur when a person resumes an activity after an interruption or total
partial, interrupts or reduces its activity due to the evolution of his disability.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter DISABLED - p 8/20

Proposal: Rethinking material aid and make it more accessible
For Ecolo, preference should be given the recognition of the autonomy project or integration of
person rather than the rigid application of a nomenclature ignoring the needs and context
life. There is no automatic proportionate to the degree of recognized disability and the need for
equipment for autonomy, home support and the inclusion of the person
disabled.
It is therefore necessary to verify, by means of a market survey, that the amounts granted to
such material aids are adapted to the cost of living and remain accessible. The list of aid
must, in turn, be reviewed in the light of developments in hardware. The granting of financial aid for
the physical layout of the living and working environment can, in turn, be relaxed and
simplified.
The transfer of the APA (elderly assistance allowance) and mobility aids to
federated entities, provides an opportunity to extend material assistance to more than 65 years. Indeed, to date,
a person whose disability appears after the age of 65 can not receive the same aid
a person whose disability appeared antérieurement9.
Generally, Ecolo also wants to review the system of granting aid to autonomy,
in order to establish a coherent system accessible to all.
In the longer term, Ecolo proposes to establish a real autonomy insurance
complementary to the existing solidarity mechanisms at the federal and regional levels. The assuranceautonomie allow redistribution in the form of monthly allowance, to persons in state
dependence. Its management is entrusted to the social partners. Through this insurance
autonomy, it will contribute to meet various needs: home help (meals,
presence, housekeeper, not medical care), accommodation in rest homes, maintaining
relationships and social life and active leisure, arrangement of living spaces, costs of loss
autonomy or off support to families and / or close assuming a load-e
elder-e or a person losing autonomie10.

PRIORITY 4: GUARANTEE COMPANY ACCESSIBLE TO ALL AND ALL
The accessibility for disabled persons is a fundamental right recognized by the Convention
United Nations on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This is one of the objectives to
reach, but especially a prerequisite for the exercise of other rights. In Article 9, the
Convention specifies that persons with disabilities should be able to live independently and
participate fully in all aspects of life and development of society. It calls
States parties to take appropriate measures to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to
all areas of life in society, on an equal footing with other citizens, and
identify and eliminate obstacles and barriers to the accessibility.
The Convention has also been ratified by all the Member States of the Union
EU in 2011. To give substance to this text, the European Union adopted in 2010 a
European strategy for the decade for people with disabilities. The first axis
Work is accessibility of goods, services including public services, and devices
assistance. It was thus established a "city Access Award" to reward cities
municipalities with over 50,000 inhabitants which take exemplary initiatives to improve
accessibility in the urban environment.
A European accessibility act was expected for 2013 but has not yet been laid. Ecolo
ensure at all levels, from Europe to the regions to the achievement of this programming
EU to make Europe a territory without hindrance.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter DISABLED - p 9/20

For Ecolo, strengthen accessibility for disabled people is a greater accessibility
for each.

Proposal: Place governments - particularly local authorities at the heart of an accessibility strategy
The obvious barriers for persons with reduced mobility must be removed and, in some
cases sanctioned: crowded sidewalks, illegal parking, too high curbs, stairs
impassable in public places, public transport inappropriate, too short phases of lights
at pedestrian crossings ... accessibility for people with disabilities but also any
the disabled, elderly or parents with young children.
Governments need to pursue relentlessly its mission to raise awareness and must
pose as models, especially regarding accessibility of buildings open to the public:
communal houses, services for the population, cultural venues or leisure ....
Local authorities are at the forefront in this area. These are in fact the ones who deliver the
planning permission and provide local services. It is therefore to continue the work
awareness and training for them to make these services accessible.
There Wallonia and Brussels associations which have specialized in the evaluation of
accessibility to persons with disabilities and existing buildings that formulate
practical recommendations for improvement. Furthermore, there is in most of the common
advisory councils of disabled people. Ecolo proposes that these persons
associations resources are mobilized with regional technicians, through a public observatory
with a mandate to identify and bring together the different "hot spots" within the space
public and propose technical solutions to address the problems they pose.
An agenda of making the necessary arrangements will be developed and maintained in its
realization by the observatory.

It should, furthermore, ensure accessibility to the physical and communicational times
festive, entertainment and celebrations, ensuring, for example, the translation into Braille and
sign language communications and interventions to the public.
Proposal: Enforce existing laws and train
Professional
The existing legislation on physical accessibility are still struggling to be too often
met. This is the "chain" to be aware: the Commons and services
planning, project authors, delegates officials ...
Similarly, associations active in accessibility for people with disabilities must
provide advisory function and referral projects and policies implemented. In Brussels, the
new "Decree inclusion" reinforces this associative mission.
It is also to be careful that the measures provided for in the project design does
not through the cracks during the production phase when savings last minute
must be performed ...
Finally, Ecolo wants to integrate in the training of "designers of public space"
(architecture, civil engineering, urban planning, interior design, design, space management
public ...) an approach to the foundations of accessibility.
Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter DISABLED - p 10/20 Proposal: Make emergency services accessible to everyone
All police services should be accessible to people with disabilities. It's about
a question of physical accessibility of the premises but also the staff training
various forms of disabilities, particularly mental disabilities.
It should also implement federal legislation to allow people
deaf and hearing impaired to send an SMS in case of emergency, because they can not
use the phone call. The patina process for several years and involve
specifically the deaf and hearing impaired in the technical realization of this
alert mode.
All the emergency services must also be trained to the specificities of people living
disabilities.
Proposal: To facilitate travel by public transport
A number of significant steps have been completed to facilitate access to
public transport. The accessibility of stations and trains SNCB and defining standards
or accessibility of information to the public in Wallonia have, for example, been strengthened. At the rate
Current deliveries of new TEC bus, systematically equipped to make
accessible, all group buses should be accessible to the 2015-2016 horizon.
It is appropriate for further action in this direction, notably to extend the facilities of access
Handicapped rolling stock and embarkation sites and improve
boarding aid procedures.
This accessibility must be thought into the design of projects and plans, and so
mandatory and not optional.
The future observatory of accessibility for the disabled should be proposed by Ecolo
systematically consulted at the earliest stages of a renovation project or build a
station or a stopping point and help avoid inappropriate development.
Specialized transport - both collective and individual - must also be accessible physically
and financially for people with reduced mobility, in appropriate schedules and limiting
as far as possible the constraints related to having to book far in advance.
Finally, tracks changes in the stations must be visually reported to
enable deaf and hearing impaired to become acquainted.
Proposal: Solving accessibility problems to the gestural translation
In Wallonia-Brussels, Ecolo mobilizes for many years so that
culture and audiovisual are accessible to deaf and hearing impaired.
In addition to translating sign language news programs, considers it essential Ecolo
to organize the translation of social debates broadcast live, subtitling emissions
recorded and dissemination of films with subtitles and audio description. Develop
subtitling and audio description would also create jobs and support
audiovisual artistic creation. The audio description must also be ubiquitous within
museums and exhibitions.
Beyond access to culture, it is important that each deaf person can benefit from help
interpreting it needs in daily life and in the course of events she
wishes to participate. For this, Ecolo has to try to overcome the lack of language interpreters
signs supporting the organization of a Master's degree in interpreting in sign language and
recognizing an interpreter status at the federal level, such as associations of all interpreters
Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter DISABLED - p 11/20 the country are calling for. This can also go through the approval in Wallonia
several interpretation services in sign language to avoid the monopoly of a single service.
Proposal: To enhance the accessibility of cultural, sports and leisure
(including listed property)
For people with disabilities can participate in cultural and sports life have
leisure, they need to ensure access. This is a physical accessibility of different places, but
Also the accessibility of websites, the counters, information, etc. Numerous
associations active in this field are essential resources to improve
situation. For example, Eco proposes that subsidies granted to festivals, events
cultural and sports are conditioned to compliance with accessibility requirements.
Proposal: Support access of everyone to information technologies
and communication11
The information and communications technology are increasingly important in our
living environments. It is well to communicate with relatives, colleagues, to organize
daily life, access to recreation, culture, civic life, to information. They
also involve able to use it. Therefore, the disabled, as well as
and other citizens regardless of their disability, must also be able to appropriate the tool
computer via adequate training.
In addition, for Ecolo, this is to ensure that persons with disabilities equal access to
virtual world. This happens, for example, through widespread Easysurfer access for all
site utilities.
PRIORITY 5: PROMOTING PARTICIPATION IN DEMOCRATIC LIFE, SOCIAL,
CULTURAL AND EMOTIONAL
Proposal: To promote the opening of places for all citizens
People with Disabilities
For people with disabilities can participate in all aspects of social life and
cultural, they need to be well received in all the places that host this type
of activity (bars, nightclubs, museums, cinemas, hotels, etc.). To allow the inclusion of
disabled people in these places, every citizen has a role to play.
Like RBC, Wallonia must provide, within the remits of some industry associations
assistance to people with disabilities, raising awareness of all actors in society to
specificities of disability and difference. Similarly, inclusive recreation services must
afford to support people with disabilities in their search of leisure activities.
Proposal: Ensuring access to voting rights
The accessibility of voting, pre-election information until the announcement of the poll, concerns all
and citizens must be guaranteed by:
11
For more information about the proposals Ecolo in new technologies, see Chapter
"Information Technologies and Communication."
Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter DISABLED - p 12/20 access to information: Ecolo proposes to make them readable and convocations
understandable by the blind or visually impaired and by people
who have difficulty understanding reading. To date, with a third person
must be requested for reading or understanding the notices;
Documents in "easy to read" and Braille, including voting procedures,
electoral convocations as well as display, instructions and signs in
polling stations. The "easy to read" uses simple phrases, short, formulas
clear, legible characters ... This is a democratic issue that goes beyond the
part of people with disabilities;
access to polling stations and polling booths to all persons with reduced mobility. For
Currently only five office is equipped with a suitable voting booth. Rest areas should,
also be provided for people with walking difficulties;
vote independently: the blind and partially sighted people should be able to vote
independently in the electronic polling stations;
sensitization of polls presidents and assessors to welcoming
Disability, like what is done in the Brussels Region. A brochure
Information and awareness can also be transmitted to each town, a
External support and mentor can guide this process.
Proposal: Take into account the emotional and sexual life
For Ecolo, the notion of support for the emotional and sexual life of people with disabilities
must be integrated into the projects of facilities and hospitable services, framing or
accommodating people with disabilities.
Ecolo wants the establishment of a Reference Committee whose tasks would be to issue
opinion on the ethical aspects related to third party intervention in the management of life
emotional and sex of the disabled within the centers and services, and to ensure
response to requests concerning individual situations.
Furthermore, like the existing center in the Brussels Region, a resource center should be
created in Wallonia, in close connection with the reference committee. It would collect and Missions
data processing (national and international), the provision of tools and
training and organizing exchanges of practices between professionals.
Ecolo has finally depth reflection be conducted about the notion assistant
sex in order to give a clear and agreed definition. This issue should be treated as
one facet of the issue of emotional and sexual life of people with disabilities.
Proposal: Promoting artistic expression of people with disabilities
Initiatives to facilitate partnerships to provide places of expression and creation
specific and mixed in different artistic disciplines must be pursued at
culture and social affairs.
Moreover, the protection of rights of performers with disabilities should be strengthened to, both,
value their achievements and protect the potential exploitation of their works by third parties.
Finally, Ecolo believes that the programming of subsidized cultural institutions could
involve partnerships with centers of creation and expression adapted so that this art is
Built-in subscriptions and programs available to all culture lovers. A
approach which is justified especially as the quality of programming is differentiated art
recognized in Belgium.
Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter DISABLED - p 13/20 PRIORITY 6: TO EDUCATION, TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT
ROUTES OF INCLUSION
Proposal: Develop school provision, as in regular education as
specialized
Every child with disabilities must have an individualized educational and school project
it is educated in mainstream or special education. To this end, specialized schools
educational teams should be supported, while ordinary and special schools
should be encouraged to work in synergy with each other, in particular to
receive ordinary education expertise acquired in specialized education.
The decree "integration" 12 has increased the number of children with disabilities
mainstream education and have them enjoy a more suitable accompaniment. However,
brakes remain effective integration into mainstream education: prejudice, cost,
Transportation, a division between the two types of education ...
To remedy this, Ecolo offers:
better organize the communication between regular education and teaching
specialized ;
enable, both PMS Centre in charge of guidance in teaching school
ordinary PMS Centre at the special education school, to follow the same child
in the integration project. "Count" such monitoring on both sides should allow
to make time in the PMS Centres project coordination
Integration between the different actors (school or school) involved, family and
the child, and to further support the transition, sometimes difficult, between teaching
primary and secondary;
to support and strengthen the capacity of action of the partners in the integration assistance,
including early Assistance Services (PAS), accompanying services (ITS) and
Assistance Services Integration (SAI), whose disability allows expertise
prepare and monitor the integration project in a regular or special schools;
integrate, to reflect on the extension of the initial teacher training, a
opening specialized education and training in inclusive education of children
with disabilities. The same goes for teacher training
already in place;
encourage and empower schools that cater to people
Type 4 physical disabilities to implement the "integration decree" and so
allow their students to attend a school of mainstream education;
otherwise respond to the needs of primary pupils with learning difficulties
as the de facto referral to special education (type 8 in particular).
Special education type 8 is for students with impaired
learning and language development but now more akin to
relegation chain. Guidance tests should be objectified and not to introduce
socio-economic or cultural bias in order not towards teaching
specialized type 8 pupils from vulnerable backgrounds or having difficulty in French
due to their origin. The regular education must strengthen immediate remediation
and implement educational strategies so that only students who meet
actually learning disabilities receive special education.
12
This decree establishes a mechanism where a child is enrolled in special education but took courses in
mainstream education while receiving specific assistance by teaching professionals
specialized.
Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter DISABLED - p 14/20 Ecolo wants to work in this direction with the educational teams, players and extracurricular
PMS centers, particularly through initial and further training of teachers;
to provide reasonable accommodation in regular schools to enable
Free School choice every parent that their child with a disability or not.
With a view to inclusive education, integration decree is a good first step
but we must go further. Mainstream schools are to be part of inclusion in
featuring accessible infrastructure, teaching materials adapted to the peculiarities of their
students and teaching staff trained in the specifics of disability.
Finally, special attention will be paid to the sign language officially recognized language
by the Federation Wallonia-Brussels. Ecolo wants an important reinforcement both in the
training for recognition of school integration experiences in the ordinary.
Proposal: To promote vocational training "inclusive", alongside
bodied
Universities, higher education institutions and organizations that
provide vocational training and continuing education have a key role to
play in the inclusion of people with disabilities. As able-bodied people, the passage
from school to the world of work is a key moment.
One of the obstacles often encountered by people with disabilities looking for a job is
the fact that they are often low-skilled. To remedy this, 'Decree inclusion "provides for the
up in Brussels, new services to help people with disabilities to have the
prerequisites for vocational training alongside able-bodied, and
to ensure individual support during the training period. It is right to
sustain these services also in Wallonia. In addition, training centers
professional and Forem must be sensitized and trained in disability issues.
Finally, to promote better access to professional training both in Brussels and
Wallonia, it is also essential to work in good cooperation with the Social Fund
European, which supports vocational training.
Proposal: Increase the number of jobs suitable quality and fight against
discrimination in hiring
Because they are drivers of change, all public services must before any other
thing meet quotas under law, decree or order. The sanctions provided in the event of
non-compliance must be applied. For example, in the federal public service since January
2013, persons with a disability who pass an entrance examination in the function
federal public may request to be entered in a specific reserve. This list appears
However little consulted.
Public services must also indirectly promote the employment of disabled people
using the services offered by the adapted work companies (ETA). Many ETA
Walloon and Brussels offer helpful service, quality and competitive with other
enterprises (impressions services and document scanning, catering services
maintenance of green spaces ...). Using some social clauses when they spend
public procurement, public services can primarily use the services of an ETA. he
This is a great opportunity to take the lead on inclusion of persons
disabilities.
At equal, the nomination of a disabled person in paid employment
"Ordinary" should be on an equal footing with other applications without discrimination or
setting aside a priori:
Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter DISABLED - p 15/20 This implies to continue and deepen the work of information and awareness
for employers, as to remove prejudices to publicize the aid
available. It should also intensify campaigns presenting the possibilities
reasonable accommodation of the workplace. It is also and already in the course of
training in management or those organized by Middle Classes that information
these employment aid must be available;
In parallel, it should enhance the experience and experiences, often positive, heads
of companies that work with the disabled;
The employment subsidies exist and just waiting to be used more. They can,
for example, take the form of sensitization, training of colleagues
disabled worker, intervention in pay and social charges
disabled worker or costs related to the organization of working station;
It is also to consider the support services as partners
both accompany the disabled person, the employer and colleagues, so
what each party feels supported and that the quality of such an approach
Collective is ensured.
Finally, it is to have reliable data on the employment of disabled people. Belgium
is, indeed, regularly pinned by international authorities for lacking
statistics on the employment of people with disabilities. A detailed knowledge of the situation is
however essential to assess the results of employment policies and assistance to persons
disabilities that are conducted on our territory.
Proposal: Locate working time and the end of occupation
Ecolo proposes to allow persons with disabilities who wish to benefit beyond
50 years (or a threshold taking into account the number of years of activity) of regime
early pension, taking into account factors such as the degree and nature of disability, the number
years of professional activity worked with this disability and medical capacity assessment
physical person.
Furthermore, Ecolo proposes to set up an organization of working time with
reasonable accommodation of disabled workers characteristics, such as
amenities schedule or work plan (late arrival to avoiding transportation
peak hours, longer pause midi ...) without loss of rights and income for the
worker and no extra cost to the employer.
In the Walloon and Brussels ETA, it is to encourage the development of devices
work positioning intended for older disabled workers. Their aim is to bring
coaching special attention to the difficulties faced by these workers and
allow the implementation of reasonable accommodation for job retention
(reduction of working time, modification of certain tasks ...).
Proposal: Support adapted work companies and to redirect
their initial public
Adapted work enterprises are particularly affected by the crisis and relocation. Face
Economic difficulties, these companies may be tempted to hire the most workers
profitable and growing out of employment a growing number of disabled people
may yet work.
Incentives must be put in place to avoid this trend. In the Brussels region, the ETA
can be helped financially to develop devices for home
support new workers, along with the work positioning devices mentioned above. Ecolo wants Wallonia engages in the same direction.
Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter DISABLED - p 16/20 Moreover, some ETA were oriented new sectors of activities, often in the
niche of the green economy, creating new opportunities, new jobs more
diversified and more open to more severe disabilities. It is important to support the ETA in these
conversions and to use existing opportunities in the market-related legislation
public to entrust their missions in partnership with other entrepreneurs.
PRIORITY 7: SUPPORTING AND CLOSE OF DISABLED PERSONS
BUSINESS SECTOR
Proposal: To support caregivers
While the number of addicts is increasing, the function
helping close is not sufficiently recognized and supported in Belgium. Thus, they
Caregivers do they receive no support to help them cope with family responsibilities
increased while trying best to continue to lead a social life, professional and
Cultural normal. But it is often a choice imposed by life, a kind of voluntary
forced.
So that the function of helping close becomes less binding, action is needed on several
levels:
expand home aid offer and the host offers people in great situation
dependence ;
more accessible external assistance at home, both materially and
financially;
give proper recognition to the caregiver and role;
Support associations support caregivers.
Indeed, the home care of a disabled person, let alone dependence,
demand high availability and results therefore often a career break
and hence a decrease in household income and a loss of professional relations
and social. Even for a fixed period, such a risk of accompanying output
labor protection system and loss of rights, mainly due to the absence of
recognition of such situations.
To answer this and prevent physical exhaustion, moral and financial carers, Ecolo
intends to establish a legal framework that recognizes the status of assisting proche13. It is thus open
similar rights to parental leave, to give flexibility to work, to provide for a
assimilation of the past period with the closest in the calculation of the pension, to enable
Job Search exemption during that period if the caregiver is near to unemployment, etc.
The proposal also provides for the possibility that a person be helped by two caregivers
close so that they can continue to work part time and thus maintain
an outdoor activity and a relational network. This proposal should also allow
better distribution of roles between men and women of the same family, role
essentially completed by the wives, daughters, mothers or sisters today.
Ecolo also proposes that the federated entities organize and subsidize associations
caregiver support, to support caregivers in their function and to fight against
their sense of isolation, through training and places of listening and sharing what each
lives.
13
Ecolo has filed a bill establishing a legal framework for the recognition of a status and helping close
a retaining their social, developed with the support services for caregivers (53K1399).
Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter DISABLED - p 17/20 Finally, the assisted person should, too, be able to appeal to a third party in this relationship
particular with helping close, that his personal wishes are respected. Indeed, the
helping-helped relationship is a difficult relationship that requires much time and energy. The
risk of abuse and suffering, both for the person being cared for the caregiver, are
therefore negligible and must be anticipated.
Proposal: Strengthen initial and ongoing training and support to
Professional
Many requirements are addressed to professional assistance to people with disabilities. They
must be listening and serving people with disabilities, co-construct life projects
with individuals and families.
It should therefore provide them time to analyze their work, interactive exchanges
their practices, their difficulties, their projects and their innovation needs. To this end, exchanges
Workers between services and institutions can be arranged, as well as moments of
collective healing which houses around a common interest, from the workers
different structures.
Social skills for listening and are also at the heart of the disability business. There
initial or continued, any Agréation procedures related to certain trades or
yet the conditions for approval of the organizations or associations must integrate this dimension.
Other professionals in non-specialized services (hospitals, family support services,
nurses) regularly work with disabled people and should also
be trained and sensitized, in connection with business-specific specificities. In Brussels,
Disability specific training services can contribute and may occur during
the training of future nurses, for example.

Proposal: Strengthen networking and building bridges between
business
To give the best opportunity for people with disabilities to develop their autonomy, the
solutions proposed can be developed and implemented collectively. So, he
is essential that all the actors that surround the person talk and know.

Proposal: Supervise and support the emergence of new professions
Demographic changes and the aging of the population, including the population situation
disability, cause the appearance of new business in response to the demands and needs
new. This applies to support and home care, health, assistance to
autonomy, leisure, education and specific learning, sport activities ...
There is a great challenge for these new trades attractive business, exercised
in the social, financial and statutory interest. They must be valued,
accessible through specific training and should focus on multidisciplinary work,
team, network, multiple collaborations.

Economic redeployment
GREEN TRANSITION
Economic and industrial redeployment
environmentally friendly, creates jobs
Status and political horizon
State of play
Even before the economic and financial crisis since 2008, the annual GDP growth
had drastically slowed since the end of the postwar boom. In addition, rising prices
raw materials during the first decade of this century reversed the trend
lower prices observed during the previous 100 years. With the depletion of
ecosystems on which an estimated 60% are greatly reduced, it is a sign that some
biophysical limits of the planet are starting to be met or have already been exceeded. The
time growth was thought that the infinite are now gone.
The United Nations Programme Environment1 projects a tripling of consumption
resources during the first half of the XXI century, which would correspond to a
quadrupling of global CO2 emissions result much more important than the most scenario
pessimistic modeled by the IPCC to date. This means that if humanity consumes
currently 1.5 planet, at the current pace, it will consume 2 in 2030 and climb up
20502 4.5 planets.
Thus, according to researchers, the twenty-first century will be shortages and peaks: oil3 except the
natural gas and copper as basic resources of a priori as coal, iron and aluminum
are also affected. If current reserves doubled for some reason, the peak
would be delayed than thirty years or a generation.
Scientists estimate that man can still issue a volume of 565 gigatonnes of CO2
in the atmosphere by 2050 to keep within a maximum increase of
temperatures of + 2 ° C. However, we know that the carbon contained in gas reserves,
oil and coal which private companies or countries like Venezuela or Kuwait
are owners of ... 2795 gigatons. Therefore, some believe a 40% chance
the international community manages to limit its emissions of greenhouse gas such that
the rise in temperature during this century be limited to 2 ° C4.

The political horizon of Ecolo for ecological transition
The temptation is to ignore these signals, comfort or fatigue. Yet eat
better or have fewer resources can go hand in hand with a prosperous life. More and more
as citizens and citizens experience it every day in their own way.

An evolution of our current consumption and production patterns that the sphere
Economic reflects the limits of our planet is in small scale courses, it will
expand to protect future generations but also women and men in
already today experiencing the consequences: floods, deadly heatwaves, declining
agricultural productivity and increase food prices, etc. This development requires
clairvoyance, audacity and innovation to break with old practices and
propose new phase with the necessary transition.
In this context, it is to support each citizen and each citizen, worker and
worker, company or sector involved in this transformation.
Ecolo intends to redeploy the economy, and particularly its industrial base, including by contributing
its relocation. A new logic is at work, instead of productivism that is
source of the exhaustion of people and resources. At the heart of this logic, is the
concept of resilience, that is to say the capacity of a group or structure to adapt to a
changing environment, to recover normal operation after a disturbance.
In this context, Ecolo pleads for economic development as an engine of prosperity
for everyone, combining quality of life and respect for the environment.
Guarantee such economic development means creating sustainable employment, notably in
economic sectors related to the environment and energy as well as to renew instead to exhaust
mastering including demand for energy and natural resources and by enhancing the role and
instead of renewed.

The Ecolo force lines for ecological transition of the economy
This new prosperity has to start thinking outside the conservative ideas that showed more than one
Once their limits. It involves the implementation of the following priorities:
Deploy an economy to meet the societal challenges
Promote innovative consumption patterns, local and sustainable
Wear regions, Belgium and Europe at the cutting edge of the circular economy and
industrial ecology
Support companies in the path of ecological transition of the economy
Anticipating social shocks and coping
Protect against socially irresponsible behavior
Putting banks serving the ecological transition and end the short-termism
Financial Markets
Supervise the operation of multinational companies and limit the size of large
multinational companies
Reorienting export markets
Improve and deepen the role of public economic tools, modes and their management
Response
Ensure a smooth transition through indicators and processes

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION - p 2/25

Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: DEPLOY ECONOMY TO MEET CHALLENGES SOCIETAL
Proposal: Amplify Employment-Environment Alliance
The concept of Employment-Environment Alliance on the observation that represents the ecological transition
an essential field of employment and economic prosperity for economies that will
adapt quickly. The idea of ​​the Employment-Environment Alliance is to stimulate
the most promising sectors in terms of economic development and employment and support
in their transition towards sustainability in order to improve the competitiveness of businesses
and develop local employment, including low-skilled public.
To do this, the Employment-Environment Alliance proposes a new dynamic of governance,
in that it aims to mobilize and coordinate public, private (whose economy
social) and community around concerted actions between them. The project is truly innovative as it
This is not only consultation and participation classics but closely associated,
from the outset, all stakeholders to achieve a genuine and collective commitment
Individual work together to achieve shared objectives, namely
developing green and social sectors and the creation of sustainable jobs.
For Ecolo, priority will therefore go to deepening the current dynamic underway
Wallonia and Brussels or the launch of new alliances employment environment, in
sectors of sustainable construction, water management, management of resources and
waste, sustainable food and agriculture5. The transition of new sectors
economic will also be stimulated to meet societal challenges mentioned above. It is believed
for example, the creative industry and the development of public spaces.
Another central tool of industrial policy is the policy of competitiveness clusters in Wallonia.
This policy will be perpetuated and reinforced in the direction of the transition, including through
new calls for project "Sustainable Development" and the greening of the poles.

Proposal: Make a copy of the public sector transition lever
Governments of all skill levels are a major player in
the Belgian economy. Public expenditure is an important part of Belgian GDP and effect
leverage these expenses is important. Given its myriad interconnections with
economic actors, the potential for exemplary government Transition Practices
ecological economy is huge. In terms of consulting, support, and statement
Statistics particular, the government can finally play a central role for the
transition. This is to use the "strike force" of the public sector to boost the transition.
To this end, it should:
To continue the current process of strengthening the sustainable nature of markets
public (social and environmental clauses);
To generalize the use of complementary indicators to GDP at all levels of power;
Establish a genuine socially responsible investment strategy (SRI)
so that all funds (cash and investments, taken public participation, etc.)
are subject to a screening sustainability;

5
For more information about the Alliance Sustainable Employment-Environment-Agriculture-Food, see 'Food and
Agriculture ".

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION - p 3/25

To the government, through all their actions, decisions and
interactions with economic actors, a factor of influence and exemplary support
transition.

Proposal: To train the transitional workers
The economy is based primarily on workers, their skills, their creativity and
expertise6.
The necessary ecological transition of the economy will be the work of a generation
Workers trained in issues of analysis and technical sustainability tools.
In order to give the transition the means of its development, it should:
To train at all educational levels and in all disciplines, workers
present and future to knowledge and know-how;
Provide new tools and develop training and academic economists
management science graduates;
To adapt all training and all trades for new skills:
architects, civil engineers, masons, lawyers, etc. ;
To provide management of jobs and skills in order to anticipate
training needs and provide specific support for workers (as defined
large) to meet the needs and expectations related to new transition areas;
Develop interdisciplinary, systems thinking, ethics development
sustainable, understanding of green technologies and technological creativity and nontechnologique.

PRIORITY 2: PROMOTE INNOVATIVE METHODS OF CONSUMPTION LOCAL
AND SUSTAINABLE

Proposal: Promote offers and requests
green products
Ecolo intends to deploy a range of tools to promote access to environmentally friendly products at a price
accessible :
labels, awareness campaigns, assistance and advice to traders,
etc. ;
producer responsibility and recovery obligation, sectoral agreements, bonuses
purchase and other incentives;
product standards and quality standards, more comprehensive labeling regulations
advertising, etc.
It also requires the strengthening of the institutional coordination between Regions
(competent in matters of industrial policies and environmental policies
Sector: waste, water, soil ...), the federal authority (jurisdiction over placing on the
product market and taxation) and European level (dealing with the compatibility of
Products with the European internal market).

6

Also our proposals in Chapter "Employment and Vocational Training".

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION - p 4/25

Proposal: Promote short circuits through the economy and the Alliance
employment-environment-agriculture-alimentation7
For short circuit, means a mode of production and marketing, which aims to
the producer closer to the consumer in all sectors. It is therefore a part of
reduce the number of intermediaries in order to ensure a fair income to producers and a fair price
to the consumer. Relational proximity induced a short circuit enhances transparency
the supply chain, product traceability, values ​​the expertise of producers, improving the quality of
products and services and creates trust between producers and consumers,
particularly in terms of quality. Short Circuit implies on the other hand a close
Geographical between all actors, which reduces transportation impacts and
contributes to a healthy environment. Short Circuit considers a goal of improving
quality of life, health and well-being, based among others on the background
environment to create economic opportunities. The short tour is part therefore in the
Employment-way alliances environment and sustainable development.
If a short circuit has enjoyed great success in recent years especially in the field
Food, initiatives are still precarious and often concern only a small proportion
Exchanges. Ecolo wants to capitalize on these experiences in order to deploy a set of actions
structured and ambitious to a motor short circuit of the relocation of an economy
based on the contact and trust between local actors.
Specifically, Ecolo offers:
Strengthen the actors and to expand knowledge in the field of short circuits;
To foster job creation and value added locally through
development of short circuits:
-

Redirect part of agricultural production towards products for
local consumption.

-

Supporting structures of production / processing / distribution (support to
Startup steps short circuit activities; facilitation of access to
financial tools; support for the development, operation and sustainability of
sustainable food enterprises; support compliance with health standards
short circuit structures; development of a network of cooperatives
public citizens / farmers; Public support for local initiatives circuits
courts).

-

Involve the distribution sector in the dynamics of short circuits.

To promote the flow of local / regional productions in nearby circuits
(via public and private communities sustainable Horeca; incentives for products
premises; the events ; etc.)
Structuring a policy of official quality labels and consistently differentiated quality
to promote local productions.

Proposal: Better regulate commercial advertising
Commercial advertising is primarily intended to sell and encourage the consumption of
products and services. It is usually almost inherently at odds with the distribution
objective information that should guide the choice of the citizens in their
consumption. It can also generate attitudes and behaviors generally
contrary to the need to reduce our environmental footprint.

7

For more information on the proposed Ecolo on this, see Chapter "Food and Agriculture".

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION - p 5/25

In addition, commercial advertising is generally more pervasive, both in
public space and beyond. It is necessary to reverse the trend. In structural terms, Ecolo
wants to change the advertising ethics Jury, composed voluntarily by
representatives of advertisers, in a regulatory commission for advertising. This could
to suspend any advertising campaign contravenes the tags listed below or
Based on consumer complaints. Besides the general regulation (public displays, media
traditional ...), special attention should be given to new forms of advertising
(internet, e-mail mass mailings ...), defense of privacy and
private spaces (all advertisements and telephone boxes, addressed items ...) and quality
the display on the ethical and environmental performance characteristics of products
sold.
Furthermore, Ecolo offers:
to legislate on the conditions of use of advertising terms such as "eco
environmental, eco, green, sustainable "in order to fight against greenwashing,
practice of wrongly presenting as environmentally or
health, products which are not;
to extend the list of products that can be advertised, for products of
a proven negative impact on the environment and health, on the basis of objective criteria
(presence of substances classified as toxic or hazardous, low energy efficiency,
high CO2 emissions, contradicting government programs such as
energy management plans, improving policies air quality, federal plan
reducing the use of pesticides, alcohol or tobacco ...);
regulate advertising to children under 12 years, and the use
image of children as shopping prescribers;
to implement, under the authority of the regulatory body, a database of
people who wish not to receive unaddressed items or be canvassing
telephone or electronically; systematize this opportunity to all
commercial enterprises and to penalize infringements;
to prohibit advertising which conveys stereotypes that can lead to behavior
discriminant: sexism, racism, homophobia, xenophobia;
to ban advertising that boasts of foreign service providers that are cheaper
by the mere fact that they circumvent labor law and standards set out in the Conventions
collective labor (social and wage dumping);
expand the areas of prohibition and restriction of advertising in public space to
better protect our environment.
Ecolo also intends to bring the debate at European level where this is appropriate (for example,
if any of the above ambitions requires the revision of a directive).

Proposal: To fight against planned obsolescence
The incorporation in the most fragile parts of product calculated to break after a
number of uses, unable to disassemble the parts making it impossible
replacement of broken parts, adding counters which stop the machine are all
Examples of planned obsolescence. Other mechanisms are implemented to require or
inducing the consumer to buy a product such unavailability of spare parts,
disappearance of repair manuals and maintenance, or the placing on the market of a new
model, making the old-fashioned. Finally, the consumer may be discouraged to keep his
if the unit prices are prohibitive to repair and / or if spare parts are almost as
expensive than a new device.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION - p 6/25

For Ecolo, the Federal Public Service Economy should investigate cases of obsolescence
programmed exposed him to establish if companies who engage in this strategy
guilty of "unfair trade practices". If this is the case, under the rules of
consumer protection, the incriminated products must be removed from sale and
companies will face financial penalties in accordance with what the law says. There
European Commission should support such initiatives in the Member States,
promote exchanges between the relevant authorities and ensure withdraw from sale all over
the territory the offending products.
For a list of goods that pose the most problems (computer equipment, televisions,
vacuum cleaners, etc.), producing companies will be encouraged to agree on a collective agreement
Consumer committing them to publish information on how to repair or recycle

Products within a reasonable time. Thus, manufacturers and sellers should:
view lifetime or use of the products, and the possible presence of
blocking counters;
furnish to consumers the means to override the limit of such a
meter by the provision of an explanatory example procedure;
availability of spare parts and place in a database manuals
maintenance and repair, or a plan of these pieces to recreate, within
two years (duration of the European guarantee) after the placing on the market. Manufacturers
would be responsible for disseminating this information. The database would be
freely accessible and free of charge via a website.
Without satisfactory agreement, Ecolo would then propose that the government act through
Legislative. Producers could be made responsible for handling waste downstream
consumption, to encourage them to promote the sustainability of their products, eco-design and
the repair.
Finally, Ecolo proposes to promote a certification logo and a public "cradle to cradle8" and that
mainly at European level and to favor this criterion in public procurement.

Proposal: Rethinking the location of the activity économique9
In addition to setting a new economic model, the question of the location of the activity
Economic can be treated differently depending on the urban context, suburban or rural. Yes
all economic sectors (production, processing and services) must be
This urban, land availability issues (scarcity of land) or
cohabitation with neighbors (coexistence functions) make the sometimes difficult. The
the tertiary sector (offices and services), which represent a significant part of
the economy and whose environmental impacts are relatively small by cons must
primarily be located in existing towns.
Ecolo promotes an economic model preserving and promoting non-urbanized areas
economic activity in urban areas establishing links and synergies with areas
peri. This approach of course involves the development of ad hoc policies
for land-use planning, sustainable mobility, housing, etc. which are
further developed in the thematic chapters of this program. The dynamism
a city follows from the mix of functions which, thanks to the simultaneous presence of
shops, restaurants, businesses, housing, etc., to avoid the dormitory towns and streets
empty after office hours.

8

The "cradle to cradle" refers to the principles of eco-design but also a concept of environmental ethics
or philosophy of industrial production that integrates, at all levels, from design, production and
product recycling, ecological requirement whose principle is zero pollution and 100% recycling.
9
For more information on the proposed Ecolo on this, see chapter "Planning".

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION - p 7/25

Proposal: Promote the economy of functionality
Ecolo intends to support initiatives that are part of an "economy of functionality."
The functionality economy refers to tangible and intangible products and services designed
combined so that together they satisfy the needs of consumers (sharing
services). Foreign experience shows that the gains are on the plans as
qu'économique10 environment.
Ecolo proposes that regional governments work to the emergence, dissemination and
gradual generalization of these innovative business models by:
a deepening of knowledge;
reducing market risks impeding the economic models;
establishing incentives;
consultation with sector federations on the potential of these.
Finally, as this is to change consumer behavior, the federal government
which is responsible for the bulk of consumer policies must also
support these transformations11.

Proposal: To support complementary currencies, with the assistance of
public economic tools
In view of strengthening the resilience of the monetary system at a time of continued crisis
sovereign debt in Europe, Ecolo intends to support projects for the creation of
complementary currencies as there are already thousands worldwide.
For Ecolo, these complementary currencies:
must pursue objectives related to the amortization of business cycles, inclusion
social, promotion of ecological approaches, the relocation of the economy;
may come from the corporate world, the Union of Municipalities and Communities or
of citizen associations (ne) s;
could be supported by public economic tools and Invests in the first place,
which could play an important role in strengthening the implementation of these projects.
The Swiss experiment conducted since 1934 with WIR demonstrates the scope and usefulness than
Complementary currencies can cover, particularly in terms of economic stability and
of resiliency in relation to neighboring economies.
Since the outbreak of the financial crisis, the issue of which was complementary currencies
previously raised at the level of districts or regions experiencing a new news.
Thus, various proposals to develop complementary currencies in the area
Euro have emerged. If a relative consensus is emerging to meet these instruments to the great
different economic situations of member states and accelerate out of the tunnel, their
arrangements sometimes differ substantially depending on the identity of the issuer, the
relationship with the euro, the amounts outstanding etc12.
Funds (under the European research and innovation program, Horizon 2020,
example) could be made to find consensus and support from
civil society organizations to reach, in the medium term, to a concrete project.

PRIORITY 3: PORTER REGIONS, BELGIUM AND EUROPE AT THE FOREFRONT
CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
Proposal: Promoting circular economy
Our economies depend heavily on a continuous supply of energy and materials
low price. This physical reality is underestimated by the classical economists. Costs
Energy and materials have increased faster in recent years than labor costs.
In addition, the sectors of energy and materials are crucial to the transition of the economy.
They represent a significant share of developed economies which depend all sectors
in one way or another. Environmental externalities of these areas are massive and
a specific action for their benefit can quickly generate many improvements
environmental and economic.
Ecolo therefore proposes that the federal and regional governments are pursuing a strategy
support for circular economy on bases of experiences and adapting certain
existing legislation (eco-design, reuse of waste, etc.).
The major objective of the circular economy is to optimize the flow of energy and materials
effectively use the minimum of resources and reduce waste while
relocating part of the economy. The circular economy is a concept that includes (1)
reduce waste upstream through eco-design, (2) the exchange of resources
side between undertakings (industrial ecology), (3) the replacement of product sales
by selling or leasing services (functional economy - see below), some generators
waste, (4) re-use, (5) repair, (6) the reuse and finally (7) recycling.
Ecolo proposes that governments promote the development of circular economy, including
Based on the method of Job Environment Alliances in ensuring awareness,
support and commitment of partners in public, private and non-profit
to these practices in social and environmental added value.
Finally, the federal government must support, with the European authorities, the need
accompany the products of a "passport security" such as "EPD
Product "that would inform how the product and its components can be recycled.

Proposal: Realizing industrial ecology approaches
Industrial ecology aims to conserve limited resources and reduce pressure on
the local and global environment by completing the flow of materials and energy in the system
Production territory, substituting by pooling resources and products or
procédés13. A number of industrial parks were able to successfully implement this
such démarches14.

for road construction is widespread. A Tampico (Mexico), a company uses polymer residues
as impermeable membrane for the production of tiles. The non-recovered carbon dioxide in enterprises
chemical is collected, processed, purified and sold to beverage companies that use it during bottling. The same

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION - p 9/25

The Walloon and Brussels governments have conducted studies in industrial ecology
the first experiments were carried out by the Walloon Government (creation of a Centre
reference in short circuits and circular economy). These studies have identified entrantssortants flow of a first set of resources (materials, water and energy) and the most ways
relevant optimization of their use in order to strengthen the regional economy, make it less
resource consuming, competitive and attractive, and to minimize its impact on
the environment while maintaining and even creating jobs.
Ecolo to adopt the path of industrial ecology implies that:
governments support businesses and territories in a process that
is a zero waste economy. "Waste" or, more appropriately "co-products" of the activities of each can become raw materials in the process
Production of the other;
inter-enterprise relations and geographic proximity are strengthened, including
to contribute to the trust between the partner companies. The business parks
Economic (a little over 200 in Wallonia) are the most appropriate entities for
start or deepen this dynamic industrial ecology;
logistical support of clusters and business networks, financial support
regional organizations, the support of regional and accompanying support tools
technological research centers in particular is assured;
an expert in industrial ecology pool be set up at regional level to
to help companies according to their transition choice;
EU legislates in order to facilitate the closure of the production and use cycles
energy efficient for obtaining the permit to operate.

Proposal: To promote the spread of alternative models such as workshops
Repair
Support for the repair sector of household goods (textile products
electrical / electronic) goes hand in hand with the development of circular economy,
feature (see below) and the fight against planned obsolescence.
Thanks to citizens' impulses, small repair shops have opened here and there
offer an alternative mode of consumption based on the exchange of skills and
experiences. These workshops deserve support to facilitate their implementation outside
big cities. Specifically, Ecolo offers consultation between associations and citizens
interested to examine levers to mobilize and partners involved in such
approach.

Proposal: To accompany industrial redeployment of Europe
The European Commission intends to bring to 20% the share of industry in value added. We
we welcome it. This would correspond to the creation of 400 000 new industrial jobs per year
2020. In this context, the Commission recognizes that "the success of industrial policy

method is employed in Kwinana, carbon dioxide from an ammonia plant. CO2 also allows
neutralize alkaline soils.
The experience of industrial ecology "National Industrial Symbiosis Programme" (NISP) in the UK has produced in
Within five years prodigious results: - 7 million tonnes of landfill waste, - 6 million tonnes
CO2 equivalent of £ 176 million turnover, costs £ -156 000 000, £ 131 million of private investment
attracted to reprocessing and recycling - 9.7 million tonnes of raw materials, - 9.6 million tons of water
waste, - 363 000 tonnes of hazardous waste. All this which, thanks to the networking of companies, has also allowed the
backup 18-30 000 jobs and creating 18 to 22 000 new jobs.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION - p 10/25

will depend largely on our ability to exploit synergies. Policies
Europe should be properly coordinated and synchronized. "
For Ecolo, the Commission must therefore take the lead, to seize the opportunities of
emerging sectors through an integrated approach that requires effective cooperation
within the Commission and coherence between its various policies.
Ecolo proposes that the Commission adopts a permanent task force to industrial policy,
responsible for coordinating and adapting the direction and the measures under the new strategy
European integrated and monitor their implementation industrial.
Furthermore, a European Parliament member association of national parliamentarians
will be organized to take stock with the Commissioner and the Task Force on developments
Recent and future prospects of the short / medium term as well as the expectations of the different
Member States. Following this discussion, recommendations will be made and they will
the monitored by MEPs.

PRIORITY 4: SUPPORTING COMPANIES IN THE WAY OF TRANSITION
ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
15

If the potential 17% reduction in the consumption of resources has been identified
EU level also applied to Wallonia and since the Region represents 0.6
0.7% of GDP and employment in the EU, some 15 300 jobs could be created just by
optimizing the use that is made of resources in our businesses, while businesses
simultaneously would save some 140 million €. Furthermore, a study by the Wuppertal
Institute showed that there was a close link between resource productivity (or, to put it
otherwise, the ecological footprint) and competitiveness of the country.

Proposal: Fix with the social partners of targets for
reduce the environmental footprint of businesses
The costs of energy and materials have risen faster in recent years than the costs
work. Ecolo therefore proposes that the social partners set themselves MTOs
(6 years, the three inter-trade agreements) in reducing the footprint
private sector resources and based on an approved methodology.
Meanwhile, at the enterprise level, information and consultation of workers
are limited so far to address the situation and the company's prospects in terms of
sales, employment and investment, should be extended to the question of management
energy and non-energy resources. A simple amendment to the Royal Decree that regulates
this material is required. The aim is to involve all staff and the awareness
gains - in terms both environmentally and economically - that can be achieved, sometimes
through small gestures, especially where raw materials account for the first cost item
and far exceed the payroll.
A new public-private partnership called "SPIRE" at European level is already showing the way:
fifty companies have committed to a 30% reduction in fossil energy intensity
production and 20% the intensity of non-renewable raw materials relative to
current levels. These two objectives should help alleviate 40% carbon footprint
participants by 2030. These objectives are part of the political branch agreements (for
avoid double subsidy) and will allow companies to value the excess quota
CO2 under a regulated ETS.

15

Specific measures for SMEs developed in the Chapter "Independents and SMEs".

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION - p 11/25

Ecolo advocates a system based branch of the agreements is available at European level.

Proposal: financially Encourage companies to enroll in the
sustainability
The modulation of part of social security contributions and other wage subsidies that represent
no less than 8 billion € 16 depending on social and environmental criteria (notably
connection with the previous proposal), and the systematic introduction of social criteria and
environmental in public procurement should motivate companies to take the plunge.
For SMEs which are sometimes hampered in their environmental approach by a lack
internal expertise or cash Ecolo offers a subsidy system for the use
to "resources" consultants.
Ecolo also proposes an awareness of public economic tools so that they support
dynamic and engaged.

Proposal: Encourage companies to environmental management
Ecolo proposes to implement and amplify the ecosystem label experiment in
Walloon Region to enable SMEs, which constitute the bulk of the Walloon economic fabric,
to acquire and use of environmental management tools to reduce their bill
energy and materials, and reduce their environmental impacts.
This support tool should enable dynamic enterprises to enhance their
environmental efforts and create healthy competition in the Walloon economic fabric,
respecting their financial and administrative constraints. It must be adapted to better
accompany and support SMEs.

Proposal: Enrich the federal plan "products" for quality standards

Ecolo intends to renew and strengthen the "Federal Integrated Product Policy Action Plan"
2010. This plan identifies for priority products considered (construction industry, products
energy consumers, household products and vehicles) actions
normative, action on prices and raising awareness, including in terms of labels.
Ecolo wishes to gradually integrate all sectors in the requirements of eco-efficiency and environmental quality. Furthermore, Ecolo wants to act through agreements
legal sector based on the law "product standards" in order to make these arrangements
binding.

PRIORITY 5: ANTICIPATE AND SOCIAL IMPACT DEAL
The crisis has exacerbated the difficulties that a number of traditional sectors had managed to
overcome year after year so far. Companies that showed good results were
overtaken by the crisis because demand has dried up.
In the all too frequent restructuring context, it is therefore to provide a
sustainable economic restructuring and quality, to promote employment or re-employment
workers, sites and tools. For a just transition from a social point of view
environmental.

Thus, study, training, sanitation and rehabilitation of sites and
production tools must be conducted, ensuring transform these old industries
sustainable production of flexible and resilient business, capable of generating added value and
the creation of more sustainable jobs.

Proposal: Pooling resources to define strategies
subregional development
The Regions are equipped with a vision to steer their development strategies.
However, Ecolo believes that complementary strategies should be designed to a level
infrarégional to help municipalities that are facing serious difficulties, such as
restructuring of a large company, to raise their heads in a spirit of mutual cooperation.
Concretely, this is where a small number of relevant indicators - to be defined through
a decree or order - turn red for a series of terraced Commons that
the public and parastatal shall consult and mobilize local expertise, resources
available financial (intermunicipal development, structural funds, etc.) and commitment
active forces to quickly establish a territorial revitalization strategy.

Proposal: Establish an observatory to anticipate restructuring
risks of job losses
After consulting the social partners, Ecolo proposes the establishment of an Observatory
restructuring with a view to achieving a watch and monitoring of potentially enterprises
difficulty ,, in a logic of anticipation.
Given that the information about these businesses is confidential and that their
disclosure could accelerate and amplify their difficulties, heavy penalties are imposed
anyone who disseminate them.
By examining very early the risks of restructuring, the Observatory could submit
as soon as possible to apply for financial help from the European Union under the
European Adjustment Fund for Globalisation. This will save valuable time
in obtaining the EU financial aid.
Furthermore, no substitute for social dialogue, the Observatory would formulate
sketches of solutions (in the form of identification of staff needs in
Similar companies for example), to anticipate problems and to limit the consequences
social, if layoffs were then determined.

Proposal: Having a Renault procedure for subcontractors to
to halt the restructuring domino
For Ecolo, it is appropriate, in consultation with the social partners, to set up a
proceeding parallel to the Renault procedure, so that all businesses working
as suppliers, customers, subcontractors in the orbit of a large company in a position of
potential difficulties may, subject to compliance with the confidentiality of information
Economic and Financial latter, receiving warning signals before they
find themselves driven to the wall of a social and economic catastrophe. The aim is to avoid
domino effect, in that contractors are trained in the fall of a major customer,
because they have not been able to diversify their markets on time.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION - p 13/25

PRIORITY 6: PROTECT BEHAVIOR socially
IRRESPONSIBLE

Proposal: Discourage the stock dismissals
For Ecolo, companies that behave predators when they carry out
collective redundancies while they record at the same time benefits should be
required to pay back public aid received in the past five years. Ecolo
however, proposes not to apply this provision in the following cases, provided that the
Business Council agrees:
companies demonstrate that their decision is the condition of a necessary adjustment
for the sustainability of the activity, in view of impending difficulties or
drastic recalibration of their strategy;
they have the financial resources devoted to R & D and continuous training so
satisfactory in view of the objectives agreed in the matter (3% of GDP dedicated to R & D which
2/3 from the private sector, 1.9% of payroll dedicated to continuing education,
50% employee participation rate in continuing education).

Proposal: Establish social and environmental duties
To protect our economy and protect our workers effects of a global market
deregulated and in accordance with the possibilities opened by the rules of the World Organization of
(WTO) and European Union (EU), Ecolo proposes the introduction of customs duties
social and environmental at European level in respect of goods and services produced in
problematic social and environmental conditions among trading partners
the exception of the countries on the list of the poorest in the world drawn up by the UN. It's about
where a powerful tool that the EU can and should use to help raise
social and environmental standards in those countries and make them comparable to
that the EU is necessary. In addition, it is an interesting track for the crisis, the
relocation of the economy and reducing transportation requirements and CO2 emissions.
The introduction of such social and environmental duties would constitute an obvious capital gain on the grounds of both economic, social and environmental ... in reverse
austerity policies pursued by the Member States and whose economic and social effects
dramatic.
Specifically, basic social standards (such as freedom of association, recognition
the effective right to collective bargaining, prohibition of forced labor or children, equality
wage gender, etc.) of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and standards
Environmental arising from the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development held in Rio de Janeiro from 3 to 14 June, 1992, the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 and
the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in 1992, should be much
useful references to regulate trade with countries outside Europe and especially
incentives for them to improve the well-being of their population. Thus, through the device
proposed, these standards will be as many motivations for countries in trade relations
with the EU to improve their social and environmental performance and their reward
efforts in this area.

Conversely, this device penalize countries that derive part of their competitive advantage in the
Non-compliance with such social or environmental standards or an aggressive policy rate
exchange as their currency is kept artificially low. Tax revenues
seen by the EU as a levy these tariffs will
mainly allocated to the strengthening of solidarity with the South and the fight against

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION - p 14/25

climate change. They will contribute both to meet these critical objectives and
the redeployment of the European economy.
In no event it does is create a blind protectionism. The aim is to fight
against social and environmental dumping which, while detrimental to the competitiveness of our
companies, violates the rights of workers and depletes resources that some countries
exporting to Europe. Compliance with these standards should guide the global economy on the way
sustainable development and allow, among others, the development of local commerce,
support to short circuits and relocated some jobs.

Proposal: To adopt a social universal jurisdiction law
Conversely, the large Belgian companies that are supplied by subcontractors and
suppliers located around the world must ensure that they have implemented
devices intended to improve conditions of life and work of their staff.
Ecolo proposes that steps in this direction in the annual report and an audit
is performed by an independent and accredited expert. Insofar as this would raise
anomalies, a commission made up of experts from government employment and
development cooperation could audition a representative of the company involved and
summoned to take the necessary measures, failing which the company would be subject to
sanctions.
A European directive could promote such a mechanism, taking into account the
different national contexts.
It should also examine the legal possibilities that would allow unions
foreign or international union to complain directly
the Belgian administration. This should then proceed with the examination of business practices
fingered. This provision should apply to all European countries.

PRIORITY 7: BANKS TO SERVING THE ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION
17
AND TO TERMINATE short-termism FINANCIAL MARKETS
According to the International Energy Agency, more than a $ trillion should be invested each
year in the world to halve CO2 emissions by 205018. Some
financial institutions have decided to join forces to meet this challenge through the "Principles
Ecuador ", initiated by private banks to encourage the inclusion of sustainability
environmental and social in project financing.
In the US, the US National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the sector regulator)
obliges the most important insurers to publish a quantitative estimate of the financial risks
climate change put them at and the means implemented to limit these
risks.

Proposal: To legislate to discourage short-termism of markets
Financial
The subprime crisis, which escalated in successive financial crises, economic, of
sovereign debt and social crisis has overshadowed the debates on the financialization of the economy

years 2005 to 2007 where the terms private equity, hedge funds began to almost
return to everyday topics. The real economy is more than ever disconnected from the sphere
including financial standards and practices continue to be impregnated.
Ecolo wants to end the short-termism of the financial markets, institutional investors and
speculators. Specifically, these include to work for:
amending Directive 2007/36 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007
on the exercise of certain rights of shareholders in listed companies. This Directive
facilitates shareholder activism by shareholders without differentiating according to the
holding period for securities companies. In other words, those who hold the
short-term actions weigh the same as those who have a long-term vision
the company. Consider digressive rights or no rights as long as the duration
the securities are held does not exceed a certain period;
Ending the practice for listed companies to publish their results
Quarterly Financial because it diverts attention from the creation of value added
the long term and innovation19;
Prohibit high frequency trading and any form of speculation on resources,
especially food, to European or even international scale.

Proposal: Move the banks to reduce the carbon intensity of their
loan portfolios and investments
Besides the shift in investment policy of the fund pension20, proposes that Ecolo
banks operating in Belgium and the European Union set up "carbon stress
tests "and are committed to reducing the carbon footprint of their loan portfolios in a sheet
approved road. So, in consultation with independent experts and government sector
should agree on a methodology for assessing the carbon footprint of investments
and current loans (initially, only those exceeding a certain threshold would be taken into
account). Based on this diagnosis and taking into account commitments to reduce
CO2 emissions, they would commit to reducing the carbon intensity of their loans and investments
and would set targets is matched with deadlines. Progress would be subject to a
monitoring. In case of disagreement on the methodology and objectives, it is for the
Government to determine the parameters to be observed. Such a device at the EU level would be
obviously even more relevant.
Several banks have already taken the plunge and have shown that profitability and sustainability were not
inconciliables21.

In 1992, the Royal Bank of Canada has an Environmental Risk Management Group which helped lead to
2002 carbon risk profile of the portfolio used to monitor potential impacts of the physical change
climate on North American sectors. Citi incorporates the potential costs of carbon into the financing of the
energy generation companies. Merrill Lynch has a specific policy for the financing of generation
coal-based electricity. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group have developed methodologies
carbon accounting to account for emissions in project financing. Bank of America was
beyond these assessments by setting targets for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases not associated
only its own operations but especially its loan portfolio to large energy producers. Thus, it
heard decline between 2004 and 2009 by 7% in the carbon intensity of its component "utilities" in its portfolio;
the objective was achieved.

PRIORITY 8: REGULATE THE OPERATION OF COMPANIES
MULTINATIONAL AND LIMIT THE SIZE OF LARGE COMPANIES
MULTINATIONAL

Proposal: To limit the size of large multinational companies
A 2011 study22 of the University of Zurich on 43 000 multinational companies has
light on complex financial interconnections between these "entities" economic (share of
equity held, including in subsidiaries or holding companies, making cross-holdings,
indirect equity participation ...) and extreme concentration of economic power. Thus, 80% of
the value of all the 43,000 surveyed multinational is controlled by 737 "entities": the
banks, insurance companies or large industrial groups. By a complex network
equity investments, 147 multinationals, while controlling themselves together,
own 40% of the economic and financial value of all the world of multinationals
whole.
This concentration is not without problems because if one of those sprawling businesses
suddenly experiencing a major problem for any reason, it will cause a series
others in its fall or, at least, will create difficulties for those related to him.
At the groups are large, at least the parent company has qualms about stimulating
intra-group competition, regardless of the negative externalities on workers,
atomised, do not weight to provide resistance to this practice. And when a result
the closure of a site, the job losses are so numerous that it is unthinkable
to meet the short term through the creation of SMEs that would take over.
Finally, in Europe, where one of the pillars of the social model and the social market economy is based on
social dialogue and negotiation, the remoteness of decision the field centers,
nuanced realities of different sites, specific practices and cultures make obsolete the
social dialogue: the incumbent management is nothing more than executing orders who are determined to
thousands of kilometers away and are only interested in their own material interest.
Phenomenon reinforced by the high-frequency trading, where the average holding period of
equity increased from seven years between 1940 and 1975 in 22 seconds ... now the United Unis23;
Europe followed the same trend.
Therefore, after the banks deemed "too big to fail" which severely undermined the rescue
public finances, leading to crises of sovereign debt, and wrongly justified policy
austerity, Ecolo wants to bring to the Europe-wide discussion on limiting the size of
private sector companies. The major restructuring in recent years can be explained by
Indeed necessarily by changes in the real economy and the opportunities offered to them
but the crazy demands of ROI in double figures while growth
GDP is at half mast and that the overcapacity subside suddenly aggressive price policies
compress their margins.

Proposal: Learn from the spirit of European competition policy
to contain the size of multinationals
Under competition policy, Europe by the voice of the Commission may oppose the
merger of companies would lead to a dominant position that could undermine the other companies
the sector.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION - p 17/25

A similar device is designed, via a revision of the Treaty in the case of companies
multinationals because of significant risks they pose to our societies. Certainly there
are regulations guaranteeing social dialogue through the European Works Councils
but experience shows that subjects addressed in it are mostly confined to
continuing education programs and abandon aspects of the group's strategy.
Moreover, the current approach does not address the question of what causes a tsunami
major restructuring for subcontractors and customers ecosystem revolving around
the multinational company, or even the loss of tax revenue in areas that are
often already in trouble or because the multinational structured the local economy, saw
most investments in infrastructure or training oriented around the needs of the
multinational.
At European level, Ecolo proposes the appointment of a Commissioner for restructuring that would
at the junction of Commissioners Skills for Employment in Industry and the Competition
Internal market. It would be responsible for the proper implementation of the relevant legislation,
the anticipation of restructuring, minimizing their effects, and could be in charge of
this new policy.

Proposal: Establish a systematic monitoring of multinationals to
like the one that covers the major banks
For Ecolo, it is also possible to large multinationals under surveillance
European territory, if they exceed a reference threshold for employment,
contribution to GDP or R & D (in Belgium, the revision numbers of a large group
Pharmaceutical had such alone cut 0.3% intensity in R & D in the country).
This does not utopian because such a device has just come into force for banks
systemic. Drawing lessons from the disproportionate impact of the Lehman bankruptcy
Brothers on the global economy and the depth of the crisis - certainly the multiple ramifications -
which resulted, European legislators finally agreed to create a mechanism
Unique Banking Supervision. Its aim is to ensure the safety and soundness of the sector. TO
To this end, the European Central Bank has the power to provide for the 140 follow
European systemic banks.
Under the proposed process to contain potential risks to multinationals, it
would strengthen the role of the European Monitoring Centre on Change (European Monitoring
Center on Change). This depends of the Dublin Foundation for the Improvement of
living and working, a consultative body of the EU and tripartite. Ecolo proposes to expand the skills,
the means and the stature of the Observatory so that it can effectively fulfill this
new mission.

PRIORITY 9: REORIENTATING EXPORT MARKETS
If for Ecolo, the priority and the majority of resources should go to the relocation of the economy,
none the less that some sectors are more dedicated to exports, due to
the limited size of the domestic market.
Exports account for about 80% of GDP (for comparison, 40% for the EU)
However, of the approximately 200 000 Belgian companies, only 8700 export outside
our borders and 450 concentrate in their hands 50% of total exportations24. However,
our exports go mainly to saturated markets and sluggish
technological content is lagging behind compared to what our main competitors.

National Bank of Belgium, 2012 Annual Report.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION - p 18/25

Ecolo intends to examine, with representatives of companies and workers, the solutions
can be implemented in geographic reorientation of upmarket and
diversification of assets we put on international markets. This is particularly
how to capture the potential of large emerging cities, especially in the field of
green technology. Indeed, 60% of global GDP is currently generated by 600 cities around
the world, the vast majority (380) is located in OECD countries. By 2025, 136
emerging market cities will rise in turn into puissance25.
For green technologies means technologies that are related to the use of energy
renewable that can consume sustainably, those related to the rational use
Energy that can consume less and those that reduce the footprint
environmental (air, water, soil, waste).

PRIORITY 10: IMPROVE AND DEEPENING THE ROLE OF ECONOMIC TOOLS
PUBLIC THEIR MODES OF MANAGEMENT AND INTERVENTION
The current functioning of public economic tools (OEP) in Wallonia and Brussels more
important (SRIW, Sogepa, Sowalfin, SRIB, SDRB, EBA ...) is not optimal. They are indeed
faced with several problems, including:
a distended link with the objectives pursued by governments;
a field of intervention not always clear and a lack of synergies between them;
a confusion of roles with the banks; a lack of proactivity to generate interest
potential project leaders and a feeling that they operate in a vacuum;
a concentration of power within the OEP does not allow administrators to
participate fully in decision-making;
an unwelcome timidity towards risk ("risk averse") for certain tools to
take over the reluctance of banks financing companies in the least
crisis period;
sometimes insufficient expertise because of the multiplication of tools;
anarchic creation of subsidiaries whose object sometimes overlap;
a package of expensive life for some of these tools.
For Ecolo, so it is necessary to rethink the galaxy of these tools and how they
operation to bring them more in the service of ecological transition of the economy and
companies for which they were designed. It is also essential to focus their
actions on socioeconomic priorities pursued by governments.

Proposal: Clarify the role of public tools
As regards the articulation of wallons tools, Eco includes:
to dedicate more clearly Sowalfin SMEs, artisans, traders, small businesses
and SRIW to large companies and high growth companies;
Sowalfin to provide an innovation pole financing of SMEs, instead of
the spin-off of creative activity by Invests in order to broaden the radiation
(from local to regional). The specific needs of these economic players require
this reorganization.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION - p 19/25

The Brussels level, Ecolo shares the conclusions of the study on streamlining tools
economic on the need for better coordination between them. Beyond the objectives
simplification and rationalization of economic operators, Ecolo calls for orientation
these tools and their actions towards a social objective, employment and a transition target
ecological economy.

Proposal: Align financing OEP on their real needs and on
achievements
Ecolo proposes that funding for OEP based preferably on drawing rights allocated
after an ex-post analysis of the conformity of the tool with the Region's policy and results
achieved, so that the allocations correspond to actual needs and are no longer
hoarded to establish the autonomy of the tool relative to the Government.
Furthermore, net cash of all Walloon OEP approaching the billion € for total
balance sheet of 2.85 billion €, or 37% of the funds that are not used. Another sign of this
untapped potential: the net cash equivalent to 69% of total assets
financial. The considerable financial resources Walloon OEP must be
consolidated into a common pool allocated to that respect their OEP walllons
commitments.
To encourage them to put cash in the service of the real economy and the transition and
to take more risks, Walloon OEP should support economic agents
so that the net cash rate as a percentage of financial assets do
not exceed a certain threshold. If that were the case, the government could reallocate surplus
OEP Walloon other according to their needs and results or use the surplus for the purpose of
fiscal consolidation.

Proposal: To accompany the ecological transition of the economy
Businesses applying for support, the OEP should propose an additional map
"Energy" and / or "resources" wider with the key to a financial contribution at a rate
preferential and / or simply a plan for a more sustainable management of the company. OEP
could even condition its support to an investment of the company these plans.
Regional and federal governments should establish an overall strategy for OEP order
to support their major objectives in terms of ecological transition of the economy.
Finally, the Walloon OEP must also support projects related to implementation
industrial ecology, short circuits and complementary currencies.

Proposal: Improve the rules of the OEP
For Ecolo, a series of operating rules must be improved. It is necessary :
clarify the mandate of the members of the management committee (preparing) and Board
administrative (administering) and incompatibilities and rights
administrators (such as having a level of information and a sufficient time
in order to examine the files submitted to them);
to pay and transparent decision-making;
adopt a risk management charter;
ensure parliamentary debate on the reports of OEP and public hearings with
administrators.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION - p 20/25

organizing the recruitment of staff and members of the management committee so
transparent, impartial and objectified.

PRIORITY 11: ENSURE PROPER CONDUCT OF TRANSITION TO GRACE
DECISION-MAKING PROCESS AND ADEQUATE INDICATORS

Proposal: Complementing GDP with additional indicators
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a leading indicator used to measure growth
economic. However, it does take into account weakly issues related to the welfare and
not take into account environmental and social issues. To, among other things, that policies
public are assessed according to different aspects that really affect citizens,
many initiatives to develop additional indicators to GDP saw
up in recent years, at all levels, including Wallonia. Five new indicators
front headlights better reflect societal progress have been adopted:
The Social Situation Index (ISS) which is based on a status indicator of the company (capital
social and human), and a status indicator imbalances and socio-economic inequalities;
The Index of Wellbeing (IBE) based on a participatory methodology;
The Ecological Footprint and biocapacity (EE) which measure the limits of the planet
over consumption of resources;
The Environmental Situation Index (ISE), which measures the quality of the environment and
is based on a state of the components of the environment indicator and an indicator
the impact on human health of the state of environmental components;
An indicator on economic capital other than GDP.
Ecolo intends complement a transverse indicator to assess the impacts of choice
operated on equality between women and men in the image of gender mainstreaming tools.
Ecolo proposes that the adoption of such alternative indicators is widespread, combining
population and the representative organizations of civil society, and with concrete objectives.

Proposal: To ensure the inclusion of additional indicators
Once adopted new indicators; it is to ensure their mainstreaming.
The adoption of the budget is one of those crucial decisions that concretely translate
policy guidelines and contribute to (re) orient individual and collective behavior.
Therefore, in the wake of budget conclaves, the Federal Planning Bureau and the organs
Regional should conduct an impact assessment of fiscal measures agreed under
these indicators and indicators of the EU 2020 Strategy (employment rate, education,
Poverty, R & D and energy / climate) (see below).
Similarly, the policy notes should be analyzed from this perspective, analysis
whose findings should be public.
Ecolo also proposes methodologies, parameters and assumptions used for these
projections are made public and submitted for advice to the ad hoc26 advisory bodies.

The goal is to ensure transparency of political decision-making, allow
citizens to have better perception driven guidance to society and
the economy and promote social consensus around these decisions.

Proposal: To evaluate each public decision in terms of sustainability
Additionally, Ecolo proposes conducting a systematic impact assessment for
previously measure the impact of each of the political decisions on sustainability. This is intended
at the federal level but is not realized in practice. At the initiative of Ecolo, a view cell
"Sustainable development" was introduced in Wallonia in 2013, whose mission is
to consider the draft decisions as far upstream as possible27. Ecolo ensure the proper application
of these measures, in the spirit of efficiency and maximum value. Ultimately, these tools
must evolve towards true sustainability inspection, with powers
equivalent to the current Inspectorate of Finance. Like the latter, which aims to check
availability of public funds based on the available budget, inspection
Sustainable Development will monitor compliance of the proposed decision with the resources
available environmental and social, environmental and economic set by
elsewhere. Similarly, Ecolo proposes that the Brussels-Capital Region put in place
Similar sustainability cell inspired by the Walloon experience.

Proposal: Ensure consistency at all levels of intervention
At European level, the practice of sustainable development strategy has not been updated
since 2006. Ecolo like to update the European strategy for sustainable development,
a European Council durable28 development path the day and that the principles of
sustainable development that promotes it are upheld.
In addition to building a federal strategy, regional and community, a process
to organize a label "Agenda 21" of communal tools subject to compliance with
certain criteria related to their development and their implementation seems particularly appropriate.

Proposal: Add a "resource" to the EU 2020 Strategy target
At European level, the strategy called "Europe 2020" was adopted in 2010 by the Heads of State and
government. This strategy is meant to be the common thread of European policies and

national in order to make the EU more inclusive, more innovative and better able to fight against
climate change. To monitor progress, five targets have been set and are
subject to annual monitoring:
Achieve an employment rate of 20-64 years 75%;
Spending 3% of GDP to research and development;
Reduce by 20 million the number of people living in poverty or who are at
risk of falling into poverty;
Reduce up to 10% the number of young people leaving school without
diploma and bring to 40% the number of 30-34 year olds have a graduate education
superior ;

27

Article 9 of the Decree on the precise Walloon sustainable development strategy that "The Government shall adopt
types of projects that government decisions are subject to review based on a prior and independent review
compliance with sustainable development and the guiding principles [...] and the modalities of the review on which
founded the notice. "
28
European negotiations related to sustainable development also takes place through the Council
the environment.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION - p 22/25

Reduce by 20% (or 30% if an international agreement) gas emissions in effect
greenhouse, 20% improvement in energy efficiency and a 20% share of energy
renewable.
Ecolo has a goal related to resource productivity be added to the Strategy
EU2020. Indeed, improving the way energy and non-energy resources
are used, the EU could reduce its 17% resource consumption with in the key,
job creation in the amount of 1.4 to 2,800,000 and annual savings for businesses
23 milliards29 competition.

Proposal: Co-build a long-term vision and innovative
On 27 June 2013, the Walloon Parliament adopted the Decree on Walloon strategy
durable30 development. This text contains a very interesting definition of development
durable31 and operational principles to be applied to the political decision so
transversale32. The decree requires that at the beginning of each parliamentary term development strategy
Sustainable be adopted by the government, after evaluation of the previous strategy. She must
include a long-term vision, objectives and means of the short term and an action plan.
Ecolo wants, for Wallonia, the strategic exercise to be reissued and fully implemented
for the 2014-2019 term, and that indicators should be adopted to facilitate
evaluation. Ecolo wants to expand this dynamic in the Brussels region and WallonieBruxelles Federation.
In particular, Ecolo wants the long terme33 vision is built in a participatory manner, with
innovative methods such as citizen panels (such as G1000) and use
Internet. The long-term vision should be part of the tools of all levels
power, European, federal, regional and municipal. Regions need to equip towns
so that they can build, in a participatory manner, a long-term vision of their
territory, taking into account the regional vision.

"sustainable development": a development that has the goal of continuously improving the quality of life and
human well-being, both locally and globally, and ensures the ability to meet the needs of the
present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs. Its realization involves taking
account the natural resource renewal rates and the maintenance of biodiversity. It also involves
continue a transition process that involves societal actors and social functions, economic and cultural, in
to ensure optimum use of all types of intangible resources, human, natural and financial and
continuous reduction of the levy on non-renewable resources.
32
Three principles are described in the decree: a) the principle of efficiency that the available resources should be
used as efficiently as possible, ensuring that each unit of resource brings the greatest contribution
possible human welfare, to also save non-renewable natural resources and to benefit
the largest number, and b) the principle of resilience that social organization must be as resistant as possible
environmental crises, social or economic, to continue to meet the collective needs through
a cross and mobilizing approach and, c) the principle of sufficiency, that the consumption of goods and
services must aim at a optimal level of mental and physical well-being, taking into account the priority to be given to
meeting the basic needs of the poorest.
33
For Ecolo, a long-term vision that would be a set of generous ideas brings little added value. The vision
long term should rather be a concrete representation of a desirable world. See example

TAXATION
For a socially just and financing
secured to the real economy and
ecological transition
Status and political horizon
State of play: A tax system that no longer fulfills its missions
Our society and economy have been transformed in recent years: the economy
financialized, juggle multinational companies with national tax systems in the
search of the greatest profit, SMEs continue to struggle to create activity and
employment while suffering from depressed economic environment, an ever larger share of
income is distributed to capital rather than labor, high labor rate areas of work
are struggling, unemployment remains structurally high. Yet, apart from
marginal adjustments and new tax deductions, the Belgian tax system did not suffer any
major changes in the last 30 years. Consequently, the tax no longer fulfills
Today its redistribution missions, funding for public services and support to
meaningful economy. Indeed, the tax system today is characterized by:
Inefficient fight against organized tax fraud and tax evasion, ever more ingenious
and facilitated by the complexity of the tax system;
A high tax burden on labor income and an extremely taxation
advantageous capital income;
A global tax facto progressive little by level of wealth (vertical equity)
and inequitable between different types of income (horizontal equity);
One of the highest corporate tax for SMEs than for large companies, because
many tax loopholes, tax engineering capacities of large companies and
mobility of capital;
Environmental taxation bleak and effective.

A fight against serious fraud and tax evasion too inefficient
At European level, fraud and tax evasion are estimated by the Commission at
1000 billion per year, or one twelfth of the Union's GDP. Belgium is certainly
no immunity against this phenomenon: DULBEA estimated in 2011 the total amount of fraud
Belgium to twenty billion annuellement1. In this regard, the Commission of Inquiry on
major tax fraud, desired and obtained by the Ecolo-Groen Group, had the merit of the
theme of the fight against fraud at the heart of current events and political choices. Measures
resulted, however, which remain too timid and implementation of slowness which indicates the
power lobbies. The sensational trials lost by the Belgian State, the active presence of

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter TAXATION - Page 1 of 21

owned banks in tax havens, regularization operations and repeated
the lack of legal and human resources allocated within the SPF Finances, service
Police or justice, the fight against fraud indicates that there is still much to do to
achieving truly effective devices and likely to bring the money to the great fraud
tax in the real economy.

An imbalance in taxation to the detriment of labor
The system is also unbalanced because it taxes more heavily than labor income
capital income: labor income is taxed at progressive rates ranging from 25-50%
while interest and dividends are taxed at a single rate of 25% in most cases2.
Capital gains on equities, meanwhile, are in fact exempt from tax; and incomes
capital advantage of favorable rates that provide "fiscal anonymity"
This distortion is not justified. It does not favor the creation of jobs and pushes
some companies to better remunerate their capital and workers. It is also
the origin of the creation of many management companies that can benefit from
lower tax. Again, in a multi-tier system, some are spared
the game to the detriment of the majority.

A tax unevenly distributed based on income.
The Belgian tax system is not progressive for various reasons. The first is that the number of
tax brackets to the individual income tax was gradually reduced and that
tax rates rise rapidly: the maximum tax bracket of 50% has already been reached
a worker whose taxable income is € 3,000 per month. Most importantly,
development of fringe benefits or tax avoidance techniques, especially
used by higher incomes, reduced taxation of higher incomes. Finally, many
income from capital (dividends, interest, capital gains) are taxed at different rates over
positive or zero for some. Despite the glaring absence of statistiques3 on it (due to
Protection of anonymity to tax income from capital), it is clear that taxation
on low and average incomes, captive of the system, is heavier than for the highest income,
which can evade taxes through avoidance mechanisms and more favorable rates on
capital income.

A corporate income tax borne by SMEs, to the advantage of multinationals
If the corporate tax (ISOC) is attached to the theoretical rate of 33.99%, many tax loopholes,
first the notional interest, make its actual rate varies. While SMEs pay
this tax at an effective average rate of 20%, large enterprises subject to it for an actual rate
means seulement4 11.8%, when it is not simply to 0% for some of them. The
SMEs form the country's economic fabric and provide the bulk of employment,
yet they are the losers of the tax on companies, unlike larger
companies and multinationals, who are spared the game.
Belgium is also a victim of the ease with which multinational companies
"Exporting" their profits abroad by international tax optimization, in the absence

In most cases. The two main exceptions are the interests of savings accounts and government bonds Leterme,
taxed at 15%.

Although statistics are indicative. The Belgian National Bank published in September 2013, a study showing
that 20% of the richest Belgian households own 61.2% of the total portfolio of Belgian households, while
The poorest 20% do hold only 0.2%.

effective legislation transfert5 price of European harmonization and control
real against tax havens.
So the corporate tax is an unfair tax as widely supported by small and
medium businesses to benefit larger. He also lost its effectiveness because
complexity requires a working increasingly important for companies to comply with
legislation, while the variable rate option deductions made him lose some legitimacy.

Environmental taxation bleak and effective
Environmental taxation is part of the overall financial mechanisms inciting
behavioral change of economic actors, be they producers, intermediaries or
consumers.
Given the necessary ecological transition of society, appears as this tax tool
less coercive than the norm, yet effective when used to benefit economically
behavior "sustainable" over behavior harmful to the environment. he
also enables escalation in time of the tax burden, based on
negotiations with stakeholders, which can then anticipate that tax pressure and achieve
technology investments to limit the cost.

Political horizon: the objectives of a green tax reform
For environmentalists, taxation must fulfill three functions:
Promote the real economy and finance an efficient public service and quality: stimulating
job creation and growth sectors and providing the means to public service
fulfill its missions;
Allow more equity between citizens through a redistributive tax system, which
corrects income inequalities and excessive heritage;
Support the ecological transition of society by encouraging behavior
investment, production and consumption patterns that allow
development of sustainable and renewable goods and services (without exhaustion
resources and reducing the climate impact) and discouraging behaviors
do not meet these goals.
From an environmental point of view, a tax reform should thus make the tax system:
more socially just, by contributing all types of income and applying
a more progressive taxation, so that the wider shoulder provide
the most important efforts;
simple: the current complexity of the system benefits those who know how to detect
loopholes, to the detriment of the vast majority of citizens;
economically more efficient by reducing the tax burden on labor (while
preserving the financing of social security), linking any tax advantage to a strict
conditionality and promoting the most innovative economic actors and creators
employment;
better designed to promote virtuous behavior and discourage behavior
adverse. Whether in environment or financing of the real economy,
the tax system as an incentive and deterrent function, functions appropriate
to review and improve. Ecolo want a tax system that promotes ecological transition

The Ecolo-Groen group tabled in the House on the subject of a proposal to combat the abuse of
Transfer pricing (53K1330).

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter TAXATION - Page 3 of 21

of society and the development of a sustainable, inclusive and job-rich
suitable.
All these objectives are only feasible if they are accompanied by a much more effective fight
against serious tax fraud. Those who engage in tax evasion live at the expense of any
vast majority of taxpayers who properly play the game and follow the rules in the
letter and in spirit. They threaten the very foundation of democratic society. Ensure
good tax collection is the first step to eventually fill moderate
tax rates.

The Ecolo force lines for a green tax reform
To achieve this green tax reform, Ecolo has six priorities:
Fight against tax fraud and better collect taxes
Reducing income inequality and ensure decent living conditions
Reforming corporate taxes
Modernising real estate taxation
Support economic redeployment
Promote innovative consumption patterns, local and sustainable

PRIORITY 1: BIG FIGHT TAX FRAUD AND BETTER BE COLLECTED
TAX
The great tax fraud constitutes a permanent threat against the very idea of ​​society
democratic. It provides, in effect, a "way out" to those who want to become passengers
clandestine society by not regularly pay their taxes. Besides enjoying
unduly public services funded by this system, they are charging the cost to the majority
taxpayers who properly play the game.
Other individuals or companies practice tax evasion, of exploiting loopholes in
legislation. Given the complexity of tax rules and fees charged by tax experts,
this practice is concentrated among the wealthiest taxpayers, as private companies.
The tax rules should be adapted to prevent avoidance race in which
Winners are known in advance.

Proposal: Improving access to banking and financial data
Having long been the norm in Belgium and other countries, such as Luxembourg and Switzerland,
bank secrecy is crumbling slowly, in favor of better information to identify
the great fraud and tax evaders. This fight against banking secrecy is far
from over.
In Belgium, Ecolo really wants to end the banking secrecy by creating a base
data containing the basic information relating to savings accounts and
life insurance held by the Belgians in Belgium and abroad (the type of base
FICOBA existing data in France) as well as the communication by banks
Belgian, payments made (beyond a few thousand euros) by Belgian to
accounts abroad. In parallel, Ecolo intends to end the possibility for a
taxpayer to several times the tax exemption of interest received on a
savings book via automatic communication by banks of
interest received by investors;

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter TAXATION - Page 4 of 21

At European level, it is to generalize the automatic exchange of information between
European tax authorities. This exchange should cover all forms of
income and wealth (savings accounts, but also the life insurance contracts,
property income, dividends, capital gains ...) and apply both to persons
physical and legal persons. The generalization of the automatic exchange principle
information should allow the EU to negotiate the end of banking secrecy with
jurisdictions such as Switzerland and offshore territories;
Beyond these intra-European trade, bilateral agreements automatic exchange
information must be negotiated with other non-European countries, with the objective
enable a better perception of the tax due.

Proposal: To fight against tax havens and tax evasion
Tax havens are territories characterized by very low tax rates, often
related to protection of the fiscal anonymity and lack of information exchange with other
country. They thus constitute a true "fiscal black hole" allowing into globally
Many individuals or companies to pay ridiculously low taxes compared to what they have in
their country of origin. Despite the willingness since 2009 by the G20 and other institutions
international fight against these practices, little has changed and tax havens
always seem to host as many capitaux6.
Without going through real tax havens, many companies or individuals benefit from
lag between the tax systems of different countries to reduce their tax beyond a
normal management: these abusive tax planning or tax evasion. That's levels
European and international that the fight against tax evasion and tax havens will be more
effective. Nevertheless, it is possible and necessary to act now also in Belgium.
At European level, Ecolo supports the following measures:
The definition of criteria and, on this basis, creating and updating a list
European official tax havens;
The extension of the obligation to publish a country by country accounting for all
internationally operating companies. This obligation must allow for taxation
Consolidated (or unit) at European level, whose revenues would then be distributed
country by country, based on real economic activity, not opportunities
tax optimization, as at present;
The establishment of a register of beneficial ownership of legal entities often
used for tax evasion, such as trusts, trust companies, foundations, etc. This

will identify the persons and organizations involved such evasion;
Stricter control of transfer prices between subsidiaries and parent homes.
In Belgium, Ecolo proposes the following measures:
The creation of a special cell for tax havens in the inspection
special taxes;
The introduction of CFC rules (controlled foreign corporations) for taxing
earnings of a company based in a tax haven, which would be linked to a Belgian company.
Currently, a Belgian company may set up a subsidiary in a tax haven in order to
transfer its profits and avoid taxes. By applying such rules, existing
in many other European countries, such benefits would be taxed, making it
fiscale7 difficult to escape;

Measures to discourage companies to resort to tax havens,
including conditioning the obtaining of all procurement entities owned
or controlled by the government (local authorities, public enterprises ...). The State
Belgium should also require public participation banks do not realize
transactions with tax havens (see below).

Proposal: Strengthen Finances SPF checking means
Despite the will expressed by the federal government to allocate more resources, equipment and
humans, the fight against tax evasion, little has changed in recent years. To
Instead, in 2013, the human resources of the Tax Administration have been drastically reduced and
thus its ability to fight against fraud.
It is necessary to provide the tax authorities, starting with the front-line services
but also via the special tax inspection (ISI), the best tools and the
specialists in their field of taxation. This to be able to cope with
montages ever more complex fraudulent companies and taxpayers.
Specifically, Ecolo proposes to increase the human resources allocated to the fight against
wide fraud by increasing staffing within the special tax inspection. To be
effective, this measure must be consistent with the judgment of the downsizing in the centers of
local controls: these are the first line able to identify suspicious folders and must
be preserved.
Ecolo also proposes expanding the skills of some officials of the Inspectorate
special taxes that may find themselves tax offenses under criminal law
and which, by definition, are directly related to laundering operations. They would receive the
quality of judicial police officer, with the specific purpose of collecting information
necessary in operations with police officers. The Public Prosecutor of substitutes,
specialized in tax matters constitute their interlocutors.
The use of computer tools to identify suspicious files (data mining) has
recently developed. This type of tool can be very useful when it comes to help a controller
select folders. The preferred practice is however currently using such tools
replacing human resources. Yet in this field, the expertise of a controller
irreplaceable: it is found that the computer selection can detect far less
fraudulent files. Ecolo requests that this type of tool to be used as decision support and not
replacing human resources.

Proposal: Strengthen criminal fight in tax matters
Ecolo proposed that the financial transaction plan. This scheme allows the author of a
Such fraud "haggle" the abandonment of a lawsuit against the payment of a negotiated sum
with the prosecution. This is a real class justice, unacceptable in the twenty century.
Ecolo also requests that judicial resources are strengthened by the commitment and
training new investigating judges specialized in the fight against organized tax fraud.
Too many records are unsuccessful due to lack of staff in a field
requires great expertise.
Finally, we must mention the role that some professionals are helping or encouraging,
to defraud their clients. The law currently provides few penalties for these people, accomplices
fraud. Ecolo offers, as recommended by the Commission of Inquiry on the Great Fraud
tax, to provide for specific penalties for professional large accomplices
tax fraud, including if necessary a disqualification and a co-responsibility in the
payment of tax avoided by their client.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter TAXATION - Page 6 of 21

Proposal: To accelerate the establishment of regional tax authorities
Several types of taxes, such as property tax and registration fees and
Succession, are regional competence, but are still perceived by the federal administration.
This transitional situation is problematic because it does not encourage the federal government to develop
ways to improve the collection of these taxes: it does will have no revenue.
Ecolo therefore wants to accelerate the establishment of regional tax authorities, which
will improve the efficiency of regional taxes and allow the fight against fraud more
effective at this level. This is all the more crucial that the regions will receive new
tax powers, following the reform of the State.

PRIORITY 2: REDUCE INCOME INEQUALITY AND ENSURE CONDITIONS
EXISTENCE decent
The tax paid by each citizen according to his income (the individual income tax or
IPP) should be reviewed to better integrate the ability of each to contribute to the funding of
Solidarity and community needs.
The IPP has become less progressive in recent years due to multiple possibilities
deductions and the special arrangements that benefit certain income. Of these, we
finds including financial income taxed at a separate rate of 0, 15 or 25% less
that therefore labor income.
The result is a charge of increasingly large burden on a large part of
taxpayers with low and average incomes, who pay for the generosity of the Belgian tax
towards the highest earners.
Ecolo calls for a reduction in the taxation of labor income by a reform of the PPI
aggregate the revenue and broaden the tax base by including financial revenues.
This way we can ensure greater progressivity of the tax and contribution
fairer income of capital to finance collective functions and solidarity. She
will finance the improvement of the purchasing power of low and middle income via
raising the exemption quota. It is therefore an important reform to strengthen
the fairness of the tax.

Proposal: Delete the taxation of income below € 1,000 monthly
and enhance tax progressivity
In order to improve the purchasing power of low and middle income, ECOLO proposes to increase to
€ 12,000 exempt portion of the income tax for taxpayers whose income is less than or equal to
€ 40,000 per year. Specifically, the share of income needed to live with dignity would not
imposed.
From an annual taxable income of € 40,000, the tax exempt quota decrease
gradually to regain its current level. This will help to focus such
measurement on low incomes and resources, ensuring its effectiveness and redistributive.
With the same objective of strengthening the progressive taxation and in addition to globalization
income, Ecolo proposes to reintroduce the tax bands above 50% for
The highest revenues, from € 250,000 corresponding to taxable compensation
Maximum public sector.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter TAXATION - Page 7 of 21

Proposal: Taxing overall labor income and capital
Currently, income from work are more strongly subject to contribution revenues
from dividends and interest, ie capital income. This is due to
that these latter categories are taxed separately, via the withholding tax: income
labor is taxed at the IPP on a sliding scale, while other types of income
are taxed at a flat rate, with consistently lower rates (between 15% and 25%
interest, 25% for dividends).
Ecolo offers globalize revenues by adding financial income to the tax return
and by taxing the same scale via a progressive tax. The income tax system
Real is in turn treated elsewhere in this chapter. This revenue may be financed,
among others, an increase in the tax-exempt quota and will benefit the vast majority of
employees and independent.
In practice, each taxpayer will declare, as it does currently, income
and various professionals in the personal income tax. The novelty is that declared by
same time its financial income and that they will enter the global tax calculation (then
they are currently taxed at the source at a lower rate). As Ecolo also proposes
to increase this tax exempt portion, as shown above, the transaction will be neutral or
positive for investors whose financial incomes are low. It is therefore neither more nor
less taxed equally and gradual labor income and capital, allowing
everyone to benefit from a first tranche of untaxed income. This measure corresponds
the system applied, among others, the US, France, Switzerland, Canada, or at
Luxembourg.

Proposal: Funding for social security as income from capital
Social contributions are funding social security and are separate from the tax. Each worker
participates in the financing of social security as it benefits from social welfare services
it provides (pension, unemployment insurance, health care, accident or illness ...). Currently,
other types of income, such as investment income, do not contribute to the funding of
social Security. Yet the importance of social security, in terms of health, the fight against
poverty, social welfare, is measured daily and it is a unique opportunity which acquired the
society as a whole. This is in fact a common good that everyone should contribute to
maintain and develop.
Therefore Ecolo wants to strengthen the alternative financing of social security and supports
a rebalanced social contribution, that is to say, a contribution levied on all types of
income, including capital income. This measure is actually complementary to taxation
comprehensive income: an additional contribution would be levied on the enlarged base of the IPP8. The
benefits will be the same: expanding the base on which are perceived
social contributions, we can reduce the rate of levy, that is to say contributions
employers 'and workers' contributions.
The introduction of such measures shall not affect the Joint Security Management
social by sociaux9 partners.

Proposal: To adapt taxation to the reality of families
The Belgian tax system, inherited from the past decades, is still very marked by the model
traditional family and many of the provisions should be reviewed to take into account
the evolution of families and life course.

9

This would in fact an extension of the current special social security contribution to a larger tax base.
For more information on this proposal, see Chapter "Social Security".

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter TAXATION - Page 8 of 21

In particular, this system favors households in which the head of family income would
consequential, while the other spouse has low income. Thus, the income to the spouse
the lowest, usually the woman, is maintained in a situation of financial dependency
from its companion. To remedy this situation, Ecolo proposes to reform tax
individuals (IPP) in view of equivalent to that individualisation
Proposed social security: in this perspective, the marital allowance to be
gradually replaced by own rights in tax matters (such as a tax credit) without
it does not result in higher taxation for households currently involved
by this measure, and without loss of rights acquired for concernées10 women.

Proposal: Establish a tax on the great heritage
Wealth inequality experiencing much higher levels than inequality
income. This is a global reality to which Belgium is no exception. Although no
Unfortunately, official data exists in this area, a recent report by the Bank
National Belgique11 estimated that 20% of the most affluent Belgian households own 61.2%
of total wealth, while 20% less wealthy possess only 0.2%.
The economic and financial crises have recently exacerbated disparities, while weighing
heavily on the budget of the Belgian and European states. Therefore proposes to introduce Ecolo
Belgian crisis contribution on large estates. Ultimately, this crisis contribution may
usefully be replaced by a European tax on the great heritage.
In Belgium, waiting for a European system (see below), Ecolo proposes to introduce a
crisis levy on assets above 1 million euros, which would be taxed at
1% to 1.5%, with an exemption in the basis for calculating the main house as well as
productive assets used as part of a professional activity.
At European level, in order to restore some tax fairness, it is appropriate to establish
a contribution of this great patrimony to finance collective functions. For Ecolo, a
Such a device is most relevant at the European level because it is urgent that the implementation of
internal market is offset by a harmonization of tax and social security rules. Taxation
the great heritage is therefore a measure to promote at EU level, for reasons
justice and efficiency. Taxation of up to 1% of assets in excess of one million
euros and 2% in excess of five million euros would yield 2% of GDP, or around
€ 250 billion per year by européenne12 scale. The European wealth tax should
Also exempt the main house and the productive assets used in connection with a
professional activity.
Any progress in European tax matters is hampered by the unanimity rule. he
is nevertheless possible to advance via an enhanced cooperation process to meet at
minimum seven member countries. Ecolo also supports advanced through this.

Proposal: Taxing speculative income
Belgium is one of the few European countries (with Luxembourg and Switzerland) not taxing
profits from resale of its shares, ie capital gains on shares. It's about
an economic aberration and an unjust situation from a social point of view. Indeed,
such exemption incentive to achieve more short-term profits by quickly selling its
shares, while the real economy needs stable investors. This exemption allows its
beneficiaries to raise significant revenue without having to participate in the property financing
public, unlike most citizens who perceive their labor income.

For more information on this proposal, see Chapter "Fight against poverty".
See http://www.nbb.be/doc/ts/publications/EconomicReview/2013/revecoII2013_H3.pdf
According to estimates by Thomas Piketty.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter TAXATION - Page 9 of 21

Therefore Ecolo proposes to tax capital gains on shares resulting from the spéculation13. It's about
taxing capital gains on sliding scale depending on the holding period: from 0 to 33%
2 years, 16.5% from 2 to 5 years 10% 5 to 8 years and 0% for capital gains realized after more than 8
years imprisonment (taking into account any losses réalisées14). This proposition
allows primarily to tax income from speculation, by exempting partially or
completely those obtained through normal management of its property or investment
stable in the real economy.

Proposal: Delete the regional flat-rate taxation
The radio-TV fee (Wallonia) and flat tax (in Brussels) are contributions
unfair, since they are identical for all taxpayers. New skills
tax that Regions will assume in the future must be able to remove these charges to
favoring contributions that take into account the contributory capacity of taxpayers.

Proposal: Introduce escalation aid
The proliferation of precarious employment (temporary jobs of short duration, split times), causes more
and more regularly a loss of revenue for welfare recipients who are able to
to get a job. Childcare costs, travel, loss of social benefits
Complementary and low wages explain this particularly penalizing situation for
only people with children, and especially so for women.
For Ecolo, it is therefore to limit or eliminate the loss of benefits by organizing
a progressive system, to avoid from 100% to 0% of aid once a threshold crossed threshold
who do not necessarily live decently, and granting benefits on
basic income, not the statut15.

Proposal: Reduce significantly the number of young people living in situations of
Poverty individualising social rights
Ecolo proposes deepening the individualisation of rights, including the right to at
Social integration income. This proposal aims to take account of the evolution of families,
remove current discrimination based on marital status, cohabitation or roommate, and
allow every adult to enjoy their own rights, independently of its links
private with another adult.
Indeed, when the contributions are collected individually, it does not hold true for
the granting of benefits, where the notion of households prevail in case of unemployment, allowance
disability and pensions in particular. In absolute terms, this undermines the principle of equality,
most often at the expense of women and youth.
1/3 of people affected at least once in 2012 RIS are under 25 years. It
be explained by the lengthening of the waiting period. The increase in the number of students
in this population is also of concern.
The non-individualisation of social rights, given the weakness of this income tends to
break the family or friendly solidarity, and pushes the individual to develop strategies,
depending on personal context, can sometimes raise more than the survival of the crime: black work,
fictitious domicile, etc.

Ecolo has filed a bill (Doc 53K2562)
To tax the "net" capital gains. It will, by cons, not possible to deduct capital losses of another
taxable income.

Ecolo proposes the establishment of transitional arrangements allowing for the acquired situations,
individualisation of rights by landing and by age cohort, with priority for the suppression of
category of cohabiting in the diets of unemployment and disability benefits; alignment
General allowances and rights to present isolated category. In this perspective
individualization, the gradual conversion of the marital quotient will also be considered.
In this perspective of individualization, the gradual conversion of the quotient will conjugal16
also envisaged, if necessary by replacing it with a flat tax credit
remboursable17.

PRIORITY 3: CORPORATE INCOME TAX REFORM
Corporation tax (ISOC), fixed rate 33.99%, became very unfair because of
many existing deductions. While SMEs pay this tax at an average real rate
20%, large enterprises subject to it for an average real rate of 11.8% seulement18,
when it is not simply to 0% for some of them. This discrepancy arises between
others, the existence of many deductions that have become engineering tools
tax widely used by major sociétés19 no real counterpart in terms of
jobs or activities. Another reason is the possibility of tax optimization
International, for which the companies "exporting" their profits to tax systems more
favorable.
So the corporate tax is an unfair tax as widely supported by small and
medium businesses to benefit larger. He also lost its effectiveness because
complexity requires a working increasingly important for companies to comply with
legislation, while the variable rate option deductions made him lose some legitimacy.

Proposal: Reforming the system of notional interest
Created in 2005, the notional interest deduction allows a business to reduce its base
taxable, and thus taxes, through its stock capital: the more she holds, the less it
pay tax.
Ecolo has always denounced the cost, inefficiency and unfairness of the system of notional interest and
called to fundamentally reform. The last recent findings only confirm the
intuitions environmentalists: the system of notional interest costs more than ever (for
the tax year 2012, the "gross cost" of the deduction was 6.1 billion euros,
800 million more than in 2011 and 2.3 billion more than in 200720) and is used primarily by
companies that are only one cash center of multinational corporations and thus create very
few jobs. SMEs will benefit from the system only up to 10% of the total
consecutive tax expenses for notional interest, so they create almost 70%
employment in our country. Belgium has become a tax haven for companies
highly capitalized, while it hardly meet the needs of businesses that create
sustainable jobs and innovating on its territory.

The marital quotient is a tax measure to reduce the tax burden of spouses and legal cohabitants
are taxed jointly.

For the 2010 tax year.
19
Thus, according to figures of the NBB, Arcelor Mittal has benefited from such tax cuts amounting to 2.1 billion
euros since the introduction of notional interest, paying a ridiculously low tax during the same years.
20
The gross cost is the loss of earnings caused by the measure. We must obviously take into account the fact that some
companies declare their taxes in other countries if this did not exist, making the actual net cost very
difficult to calculate. Nevertheless, the evolution of this cost is already a relevant indicator. (Source: Inventory 2012
exemptions, reliefs and reductions that affect state revenues, the House of Representatives, Doc
53/3070/002).

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Economic Redeployment - TAXATION Chapter - Page 11 of 21

For all these reasons, Ecolo wants to replace the notional interest deduction by
measures for companies active in the development of the real economy on the
Belgium: the investment deduction and the tax credit for venture capital. This
last measure would achieve a 7.5% tax credit up to any new contribution
Net capital of the company. Unlike the notional interest, the measure therefore applies
only "new" capital of the year and not at all the stock of accumulated equity. he
So this is a powerful incentive to capitalize her business, for small businesses, which presents
similar benefits to notional interest but do not know the risk of drift and
abusive optimization that they have trained.

Proposal: Work towards a European harmonization of taxes sociétés21
Corporation tax (ISOC) is, par excellence, a tax area where concerted action at
European level is needed to get results.
As one recent report OCDE22, racing fiscal lowest bidder prevails in
Most countries in the European Union, which compete to invent
features that, de facto, help to reduce substantially both the tax base and
the tax rate actually paid by large companies.
In this regard, Eco supports the following measures:
The quick review of the Parent-Subsidiary Directive and the Directive on interest payments
and royalties to tackle the most serious excesses planning
aggressive tax;
The adoption of the common consolidated basis ISOC (ACCIS23) at European level,
which will provide both a single definition of profits and their allocation to states
members on an objective basis; This case is currently stalled due to lack of
political will;
European harmonization, in the form of minimum / maximum ranges, rates
tax profits by making gradual, so as to promote SMEs;
The initiation of a European process of "tax multilateral disarmament" to
through which member states progressively démantèleraient devices (laws,
regulations, fiscal ruling) through which they engage in tax competition
abusive;
For SMEs, generalize the reduced rate of corporation tax (ISOC) 25% (instead of
33.99%) results for all slices.

PRIORITY 4: MODERNIZING THE ESTATE TAX

Proposal: Review the registration fees
Ecolo wants to make more respectful registration fees contributory capacity
future owners. It will be necessary to allow exemptions, deductions, reduced rates, to
single house in which we live and provided that the value of the house does not exceed one
certain threshold. By limiting these possibilities, it is possible, in a neutral setting a viewpoint

budget, granting greater reductions smallholders who
really need. It should also be alert to high land pressure areas
require special treatment.

Proposal: Make really fair inheritance rights
Estate taxes are supposed to ensure greater equality of opportunity in taxing
assets transferred by the heirs of the deceased, knowing that the amount of these goods
varies widely in the population, even more than the income level.
But given the many existing resources to avoid or greatly reduce such rights, this
Tax currently rests largely on the shoulders of the middle class, whose
Heritage is high enough to be subject to inheritance tax, but too weak to do
call specialists succession planning.
To make inheritance tax their primary function, that of ensuring greater
equal opportunities, Ecolo proposes to reduce the direct line rate for the first
tax brackets, together with a reform drastically reducing the possibilities
to avoid the payment of such fees. This, so that everyone actually contributes according to
its ability to pay, which will allow many people to pay less
inheritance tax.

Proposal: Modernising real estate taxation
Property tax covers various types of taxes, federal (tax share paid by PPI
the landlords) and regional (property tax, registration fees, rights
estate related to real estate).
Property tax, payable by all owners, as well as the tax levied on the PPI due from
landlords, is taxable cadastral income. Now this basis, not seen since
long problem: the property is taxed similarly it is maintained or not rented at a price
reasonable or not, or not conveniently located with regard to the development policy
territory, energetically efficient or not well equipped or not, etc. Some municipalities, in
financial pressure, also increase their rate of surcharges to withholding tax, this
which would probably not have been necessary if the cadastral income had changed over time. But
we think it appropriate to overtax hirers owners, for whom the rent is
sometimes a necessary income supplement.
Ecolo proposes to modernize these taxes without increasing the current global debit and
taking into account the fiscal capacity of each, in order to meet the objectives:
Tax Fairness;
improvement of financial access to housing (rental as acquisitive);
decreasing energy consumption;
improving the quality of existing homes;
support to the regional and town planning policy.
Eventually, as part of a comprehensive tax reform and the Federal District, this probably happens
by establishing new tax bases objectified through collaborations
Public / Region / Federal government and meeting all these objectives.
Ecolo also suggests that reductions for homeowners are automatic and
that tenants can lodge their applications directly to the administration and
receive any reductions without going through the owner.

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Economic Redeployment - TAXATION Chapter - Page 13 of 21

It should also ensure that the reduction for dependent children can be shared
equally between separated parents.

Proposal: Promote, in a targeted manner, access to the property
Being a homeowner is an important part of a subsistence protection,
especially when one reaches retirement age. Seniors who are homeowners,
particularly if it is well insulated and equipped, saving as much rent costs, and have
and a stronger capital investment potential financial risk.
Invest in the purchase of his own home is therefore a decision that should be encouraged by
tax incentives, bonuses or by soft loans, taking into account income
taxpayers concerned, to support poor families, energy efficiency
buildings, built to promote a little consumer or totally autonomous in terms
energy, the location, to promote densification of the habitat. These aid policies to the
construction or acquisition of housing effective energy-also contribute
the development of the activity in the construction sector, economic sector by definition
délocalisable25 little.

PRIORITY 5: SUPPORT THE ECONOMIC Redeployment
Proposal: To make attractive investments relevant to the real economy
Entrepreneurs and SMEs currently face great difficulties in obtaining credit
to launch new activities or to diversify and expand their operations.
The authorities also lack financial resources to be mobilized rapidly
meet the building needs, development and maintenance of kindergartens, schools,
collective infrastructure.
Yet the savings of Belgian citizens has never been so high (over 240 billion
savings accounts and over $ 200 billion in pension funds).
It is therefore necessary to encourage banks to reinvest in these areas, while bringing
citizens the confidence that they are also turning to investments
directly related to the real economy.
Therefore Ecolo offers to direct and concentrate the tax incentives to investments
useful to the real economy, such as the right of states, investments socially and environmentally
officials and corporate finance activities or cooperative management mode.
In particular, Ecolo proposes to extend the tax exemption to the savings accounts
all investments in the primary market while putting in place a reporting obligation
securities income to IPP, which will allow a fairer and more efficient collection of taxes
on capital.
These tax measures complement the proposals we make to force banks to
mobilize savings towards sustainable projects and SMEs through the green and our booklets
proposal to encourage and protect the loan from relatives to support activity

Proposal: Promoting circular economy
Our economies depend heavily on a continuous supply of energy and materials
low price. This physical reality is underestimated by the classical economists. Costs
Energy and materials have increased faster in recent years than labor costs.
In addition, the sectors of energy and materials are crucial to the transition of the economy.
They represent a significant share of developed economies which depend all sectors
in one way or another. Environmental externalities of these areas are massive and
a specific action for their benefit can quickly generate many improvements
environmental and economic.
Ecolo therefore proposes that the federal and regional governments, bases on experiences
realized and adapting existing legislation, pursuing a strategy to support
the circular economy; Currently, some rules unnecessarily disadvantage circular economy
(eco-design, reuse of waste, etc.).
The major objective of the circular economy is to optimize the flow of energy and materials
effectively using a minimum of resources and reduce waste while
relocating part of the economy. The circular economy is a concept that includes (1)
reduce waste upstream through eco-design, (2) the exchange of resources
side between undertakings (industrial ecology), (3) the replacement of product sales
by selling or leasing services (functional economy - see below), some generators
waste, (4) re-use, (5) repair, (6) the reuse and finally (7) recycling.
Ecolo proposes that governments promote the development of circular economy, including
Based on the method of Job Environment Alliances in ensuring awareness,
support and commitment of partners in public, private and non-profit
to these practices in social and environmental added value.
Ecolo also proposes tax encourage companies that invest in the economy
circular. Based on a lifecycle analysis of natural resource used in the activity
Economic, companies that are part of the circular economy would be exempt, in whole
or part, of fees or taxes environnementales27.
Finally, the federal government must support, with the European authorities, the need
accompany the products of a "passport security" such as "EPD
Product "indicating how the product and its components can be recyclés28.

Proposal: To support investment and capital formation for
SMEs
The budgetary cost of notional interest is very high, no real effect on the real economy,
employment, SMEs and Research and Development. Ecolo proposed replacing the system
notional interest deduction as it currently exists by strengthening devices
that allow companies to establish capital reserves, to use them for
develop and benefit from the same deductions as if they were using a bank loan.
The measurement of notional interest, created in 2005, did not present a single asset, the balance
the tax treatment of loan financing and equity financing, prompting
companies to be adequately capitalized. Only companies that have the greatest need
up more capital, namely SMEs, are unable to take advantage of such a
measured. Beside that, this measure has operated as a true "weapon of tax exemption
massive "for large and multinational companies have established their tax office in Belgium
without it brings real economic and social benefits in Belgium.

For more information on the proposed Ecolo on this, see Chapter "Environment".
For more information on this proposal, see Chapter "ecological transition".

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Economic Redeployment - TAXATION Chapter - Page 15 of 21

If the system of notional interest continues, Ecolo therefore intends to propose:
to better support the real economy and innovation by quadrupling capacity deduction
notional interest for SMEs (4.5% for SMEs) and for
R & D activities. It is in this area that companies and public authorities
must make a substantial effort to achieve our ecological transition
economy ;
contribute to the fight against unemployment, conditioning, as regards the most
large companies, access to the deductibility of notional interest in maintaining the volume
employment in the enterprise;
various mechanisms to prevent excessive tax deductions such as the use
techniques like "sale and lease back" 29 to artificially increase funds
own the company.
Ecolo but believes it would be more appropriate, and bearing in terms of business development and
jobs, to boost existing measures in favor of investment such as the deduction
Investment tax credit and risk capital, the latter being reserved for SMEs.
These measures target the support to investment and to the constitution of own funds for
invest and are much less likely to be misused by
companies wishing to make agressive30 tax planning.

Proposal: To promote investment in young SMEs
Access to credit is particularly difficult for the "starters" of young companies
often lack capital and does not enjoy the confidence of the bankers.
These starters can sometimes benefit from close support, but these take a long
risks meager benefits, when they agree to invest financially in these projects.
To improve this situation, the Flemish region created the "win-win lening" by which a
person carrying a maximum € 50,000 loan can benefit from a tax reduction of 2.5%
of the loan amount per year. This mechanism comes with a "guarantee", financed by the Region
Flemish, in case of default by the company: 30% of the loan amount is then removed
taxes back. This system works very well for a reasonable cost.
Ecolo proposes to generalize this system by creating a "Ready Proxi" in Brussels and Regions
Wallonne31 with a tax reduction of 2.75% of the capped loan. This will be
strongly control the origin of the funds, the fight against money laundering, and to give
greater reduction for SMEs working in the field of durables32 technologies.

PRIORITY 6: PROMOTE INNOVATIVE METHODS OF CONSUMPTION LOCAL
AND SUSTAINABLE

Proposal: Promote demand by making green choices cheaper
Ecolo intends to deploy a range of tools to promote access to environmentally friendly products at a price
accessible :

29

This is a technique by which a company sells an asset to a company and then rent it, which allows it
to increase its own funds.

labels, awareness campaigns, assistance and advice to traders,
etc. :
producer responsibility and recovery obligation, sectoral agreements, bonuses
purchase and other incentives:
product standards and quality standards, more comprehensive labeling regulations
advertising, etc. ;
the removal of subsidies harmful to the environment. This is to achieve a
inventory of subsidies, subsidies and other government support for products or pollutants
conducive to pollutant behavior and provide for a phasing out of
the most impacting subsidies at the environmental level.
It also requires the strengthening of the institutional coordination between regions
(competent in matters of industrial policies and environmental policies
Sector: waste, water, soil ...), the federal authority (jurisdiction over placing on the
product market and taxation) and European level (dealing with the compatibility of
Products with the European internal market) 33.

Proposal: Increase the share of returnable packaging, including cans
beverages
Cans and other beverage containers pose a significant public cleanliness issues
and the collection system is inadequate to respond. Their removal is very expensive for
municipalities. To remedy this, Ecolo proposes to introduce a deposit on drink cans and
to gradually expand to other packaging. A study in this direction showed that
to be justified and effective, the system had to be conducted in the three Regions or
better at European level.

Proposal: Establish a European kerosene tax
Currently, kerosene is then the least taxed fuel that plane by the transport
is the most polluting mode of transport. It is urgent to put an end to this aberration. he
is not possible to tax kerosene without acting at European level, where a directive prohibits
raise excise duties on that fuel. Ecolo therefore intends to set up a European tax
the kérosène34.

Proposal: Get nuclear annuity
Pending closure, one of the priorities of Ecolo is the adoption of a law to tax the
undue benefits of nuclear power plant operators. These facilities have been written so
accelerated before market liberalization (through higher tariffs for consumers) and
resulting benefits should be fully recovered and redistributed to invest in
both in the development of renewable energy in controlling consumption but
also in building transport and energy distribution networks.
Depending on the future price of electricity, the recovery of the nuclear rent beyond the tax already
received but deemed insufficient by Ecolo (ie € 550M annually) would allow the period
2014-2025 tax revenue of between 1.7 and 4.5 billion euros35.

Proposal: Ensure access of all to energy efficiency
To reduce the energy consumption of landlords and tenants and enable them to
finance the necessary works, Ecolo proposes to continue and strengthen the implementation of
financial incentives such as energy premiums, the Ecopack (Wallonia) and the Green Ready (Brussels) to
that those who do not have their own funds can make the necessary investments
in their housing.
The funding mechanism makes investment in energy savings and
renewable energy "painless": the household is not to advance equity and
repaid monthly payment remains less than or equal to the energy savings from the
decrease in énergie36 bills. In addition, for households below an income level
to define, the company helps to remove any interest in order to achieve a rate loan
zero.
Ecolo proposes the creation of a vert37 booklet. The money saved would aim to support
activities reaching a balance between economic development and respect for workers, the
workers and the environment. Could thus be financed, SMEs, individuals
or companies active in green technologies or perform work related to the reduction
energy consumption.
Persons for whom an abnormally high power consumption is detected during
audit or on the basis of invoices, also benefit from support type guidance
energy.
Moreover, especially for tenants and older people, proposes that the Ecolo
Energy Saver loan is not linked to individuals but to the building. Specifically, as
these people occupy the building, they repay the loan in proportion to the energy savings,
minus a sum to reward approach. The next occupant housing
pursue reimbursement under the same conditions. Moreover, to avoid soaring prices
rents, work to improve the energy quality of the rented accommodation should not
lead to higher rents than the economy thanks to the work carried out during
the duration of the repayment period, net of public aid received by the
propriétaire38.

Proposal: Reduce VAT on investment in savings
Energy
To promote energy savings, Ecolo proposes to reduce VAT rates of 21-6%
in particular for the construction of passive houses or reaching a performance standard
Overall equivalent low energy renovation, after the sale of heat heating networks,
the power generation equipment, equipment and systems for savings
energy and ecological materials. This measure should be extended at European level in
a second temps39.

Proposal: Establish third-investor "energy efficiency"
for institutions, companies and non-profit sector
Ecolo intends to support, through the mechanism of the third investor, business investment,
institutions and non-profit sector to improve energy efficiency and
develop renewable energy. Under this formula, the third investor funds and executes

work to achieve energy savings; he repays by savings
Financial realized from lower energy bills generated by this work.
Ecolo offers:
to support these investments in companies, tripling the percentage of
increased deduction for investment, with 13.5 to 40.5% 40;
clarify the rules on public procurement to reflect this type of
market with intervention of third-investor. This clarification is needed to
determine the method of awarding the contract but also to determine on what basis
tenders should be compared;
amplify the action of the federal Third investor - Fedesco - and to develop tools
Similar in Regions;
that formulas third-investors become eligible in the same way as other
all aid work in the voluntary sector and non-profit. In parallel,
good governance rules for third-investors will be in place to avoid

Economic redeployment
INDEPENDENT AND SMEs
A creative entrepreneurial culture
jobs and innovation
Status and political horizon
State of play
The economic redeployment of our country and our regions needs entrepreneurs,
entrepreneurs and innovators, but the context of economic and financial crisis weakens
particularly those economic actors. Independent and self-employed, female heads and chiefs
companies, mostly very small and medium enterprises (small and micro businesses) attempt
keep head above water but access to credit is becoming increasingly difficult. The capital is
are not sufficiently mobilized in financing the real economy.
The evidence of this economic slump are numerous:
a continuous increase in faillites1 knowing that 92% of bankruptcies concern
companies with fewer than five workers. Just to illustrate this assertion, to look
the number of bankruptcies in 2013 and its impact on employment. From January
in September 2013, some 8,904 companies went bankrupt, or 12% more than for the
same period of 2012. It is therefore of some 19,934 jobs have been threatened
(6%) 2;
an average independent income below inflation. 16%
Entrepreneurs live on less than € 833 while the poverty line in 2013
amounted to € 973;
an increase of 5% over 2012 independent deadlines for requesting
pay their social security contributions, or about 5 500 applications for the first 6 months
20133;
degradation of living conditions for entrepreneurs. 92% say they or they
are forced to work while they are malades4;
increased delays paiement5 from the private and public clients.
The daily reality of these entrepreneurs is alarming and the crisis plunges day after day
too many independent deadlocked. The action of the federal government, despite the
statements, was ineffective. It is in this logic qu'Ecolo intends to support those

and those who live our economy and employment in everyday life, the creative and creators
companies and projects.
Indeed, SMEs employ a very large share of workers: all independent
and employees of less than 50 people representing businesses 63% of private employment
Wallonia and 50% Bruxelles6.
SMEs also represent an economic activity located in the economic fabric but
also social and cultural development of their place of business. They are not generally and relocated
can develop economic activities linked to the needs, the resources of their
regional and local expertise.

The political horizon of Ecolo for SMEs and independent
It is more necessary than ever to support much more freelancers and SMEs
through these difficult times and to offer them concrete ways of work. Freelance
and SMEs must be at the center of a project for sustainable economic redeployment and be seen
as one of the main drivers of the Belgian economic fabric and job creation
diversified.
Ecolo aims to encourage creativity and create favorable conditions for women and
men of today and tomorrow to develop their projects and live in dignity.
It is also to enable each and everyone who wants to capture trades and
know-how to give a more sustainable perspective to our economic output, for
bringing together the entrepreneurial passion and the holders of a social value trades,
environmental or heritage. Our society is a society in transition that develops
new needs. In this context, Ecolo intends to support the development of trades
crafts, trades of the green economy, proximity services to people and
new alternative modes of development as functional economy or
recyclage7.
This unwavering support of Ecolo for innovation and creativity is also justified by the importance
creating value and jobs they induce. Indeed, the energy areas
renewables, energy efficiency and energy savings constitute deposits
significant job. In 2011, the market for renewable energy in all sectors, has
employed 16 650 people in Belgium, of which 9400 in Wallonia. According to Cap Gemini and AGORIA it
believes that Wallonia has a potential to create 15,000 additional jobs by 2020
in the energy sector renouvelable8. The Federal Planning Bureau estimates that the transition to
a 100% renewable energy system in Belgium by 2030 can generate up to 60,000
supplémentaires9 jobs. In the energy saving sector, the potential is also
important. Thus, for example, the Confederation of Construction estimates that the greening
economy should, in itself, lead to the creation of 13 500 jobs in Belgium in 10 years10.
A faster pace of energy retrofits could double that figure.
SMEs are and will be involved in the transition of the economy but they need help to participate
dynamic research and R & D. Expenditure on R & D in Belgium are, in fact,
largely concentrated in large companies and oriented in some of the sectors
transition11.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter INDEPENDENT AND SMEs - p 2/22

The Ecolo force lines
Ecolo adopts the following policy priorities to restore meaning to the redeployment
Economic and give them the place they deserve to independent and business leaders:
Stimulating entrepreneurial culture for the development of a passion, a
job
Support the creation, encourage creativity and independent simplify life and
CEOs
Improving access to finance for SMEs and independent
Accompany and support independent in difficulty
Ensuring independent and independent a decent standard of living
Supporting female entrepreneurship

PRIORITY 1: FOSTERING ENTREPRENEURIAL CULTURE TO ALLOW
DEVELOPING A PASSION FOR BUSINESS
Born a contractor or, conversely, can we become? To this question, Ecolo answers: the
two ! Because, although, for some, the choice is obvious entrepreneurship, culture
entrepreneurship should be cultivated and valued in a world where the one who undertakes
facing many difficulties. The fear of embarking or even fear of failure, uncertainty,
can not be the engines of a lifestyle choice. Those who want to innovate, create
their business and enhance their expertise, should find support and encouragement from
public authorities. They have an important role to play in the transition of our society,
offering innovative and sustainable products and services.
Therefore Ecolo wants to spread the entrepreneurial culture among young people, graduates and
researchers and help educational structures to open up the world of economic activity
concrete, professions, passions, and of industrial activity while stimulating ideas
innovative entrepreneurial. It is thus important to take into account the component
culture and identity of entrepreneurship and this is only possible via an awareness
creativity and innovation. To do this, several initiatives should be taken.

Proposal: Promoting entrepreneurship and spark creativity
Ecolo proposes to enhance the taste of entrepreneurship at school, both to disseminate culture
boldness and innovation, but also to restore the crest of training
vocationally.
Some practical measures can be implemented:
Forge alliances between the school and the economic actors to allow
development of attitudes conducive to entrepreneurship: learn to value his ideas,
determine how to implement them in an individual or collective project, know the
cycle management of a project and learn how to bounce the face of difficulties: many
skills that can be acquired in specialized modules or not;
Seek to promote the image and the contractor including training
vocationally with parents, for whom these courses are still too
often a "second choice";
If at present there within the stimulus Agency (ESA) a
cell to play this role in awakening the entrepreneurial culture, this service has

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter INDEPENDENT AND SMEs - p 3/22

encourage, like what is done by the Brussels Enterprise Agency (BEA) in
Brussels region, the arrival of artisans and independent and corporate leaders to
and they testify that, in secondary schools, experience
daily. This awareness at school also participate in the revaluation
the entrepreneur's image, for now too stigmatized;
Supporting initiatives like ICHEC-PME, Junior Achievement, and many others who have
aims to arouse vocations for young people today are
tomorrow's entrepreneurs;
Extend alternately masters developed a pilot basis enrolling in
an acceleration concern for ecological transition of our regions if evaluation
positive;
Making the transition to sustainable development (technology and green economy,
environment, energy, circular economy, etc.) a central axis programs
entrepreneurship and stimulating creativity.

Proposal: Reforming and strengthening the training and lessons offered
youth and independent
These courses are as likely to help develop the expertise and
reduce the number of avoidable failures.
Ecolo offers:
To offer continued training in all areas of management (marketing,
strategy, accounting and treasury, human resources management, etc.) to
strengthen basic professional skills for independent or
entrepreneur in the making, beginner or experienced already. These courses should be
easy to access and inexpensive for the different categories of data;
Incorporate in educational programs for young people and
independent quality training to excellence;
To ensure the inclusion in the curriculum of courses that lead to
independent of trades, including all professions, concepts
base in terms of management and accounting;
To integrate the different sectors of qualifying and professionalizing training,
teaching full time or alternating or apprenticeship, news
skills needed for the transition of the economy (energy, nontechnologique innovation, functional economy, etc.).

Proposal: To recognize special status of craftsmanship coupled with a
valuation of manual trades
The crafts development represents an economic as well as social added value
and heritage. For Ecolo, it is important to meet the expectations and concerns of the sector
about the future of TPE and craftsmen. The craft has to preserve its specificities, needs a
specific business structure. This should be centered around a know-how. She must
promote effective transfer of knowledge and actions between the craftsman and his apprentices. She
should always include the complete cycle of designing a well, its realization through
methods acquired, transmitted but also innovated, and installation or sales phase. This is
this logic and to meet these specific qu'Ecolo offers, as requested by the Union
Belgian craftsmen, to limit the size of small businesses to 10 workers. As is
practice today, many craft businesses can of course come together to
set up a consortium of several bodies of complementary business. It's the

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter INDEPENDENT AND SMEs - p 4/22

cases in the area of ​​the factory organ, in the agri-food sector and in the sector
roofing for example.
Ecolo also offers:
a vision that induces crafts supplies short circuit and a Master
full production process;
recognition of the artisan training through the entrance, its recognition by
peers and demands on the quality of the finished product for the acquisition of the label
"Cottage industry";
to ensure equal access to public contracts craft TPE. It is suitable for the end of
limit recourse to the criterion of turnover in the tenders and to analyze
each procurement opportunities and interest of the cut so that a batch
craft business can more easily seize a part of the project. Players
bank must also play the game artisanal TPE providing, whenever
necessary bank guarantees sufficient to allow these companies to go
in the running of public procurement;
to launch the face of declines in public investment in this area in the last
decade a "Heritage" plan to revitalize the sector of the restoration of
heritage and, more broadly, crafts.

Proposal: To ensure the transfer of a business and know-how
The transfer of businesses, especially SMEs, is one of the major challenges of 2020.
According to the SME Finance Knowledge Center (BeCeFi), the problem of
transmission will reach more than 40% of Belgian companies is 30 000 companies / year.
Ecolo intends to set up a mechanism for independent and business leaders
to better prepare this transmission, essential to the survival of the local economy and
maintaining know-how on the Brussels and Wallonia.
It is right to :
educate business leaders to this reality. The transmission is, in effect, a phase
delicate life and requires good preparation. This is why the Governments
federal and regional will launch in 2014 an awareness campaign on the
subject ;
Public awareness of existing economic tools to facilitate the transmission,
as Sowacess or Brutrade, which are too often overlooked and must
be subject to an advertising and information campaign, incorporating the various aids
made to entrepreneurs. It is also concerning Sowaccess of
allow independent and SMEs wishing to benefit from its services to have access
free;
encourage the resumption by workers such as cooperative. Indeed,
often at the time of transmission, the best position for the resumption of business and
continuity of expertise are the employees themselves. Transmission occurs by
direct transformation of the company concerned in working Cooperative Society
Production (SCOP) 12; the company retains its status as a commercial company, its
company number, VAT number, identity and history but also its
regular partners (banks, advice, suppliers). Fair transaction price
is added, furthermore, the reliability of this type of operation: little or no risk of
termination of the transaction and the buyers already know all of the company (the
customers, production facilities, the quality of employees, the finances ...). To
12

See Chapter "Social Economy and Cooperative".

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter INDEPENDENT AND SMEs - p 5/22

encourage this type of transmission and under certain conditions, a specific regime
must be set up for SME managers who are retiring and who can
benefit from a reduction on the amount of capital gains;
create a right to information and preferably for employees during procedures
Judicial applicable to firms in difficulty. If equivalent supply, priority
should be given to the takeover bid in SCOP. A special tax regime could
Application also be to encourage the transition period between a company
classic and SCOP;
generalizing, guarantee and specific regional aids amplify transmission
companies such as aid to tutoring for framing a trainee in Region
Brussels or specific financial products offered by the tools
economic Walloon or Brussels.

PRIORITY 2: SUPPORT THE CREATION, ENCOURAGE CREATIVITY AND EASIER
LIFE OF INDEPENDENT AND ENTREPRENEURS
Proposal: Create a simplified status for the first three years of activity
This measure will allow Ecolo, women and men who decide to take
risks and embarking as an entrepreneur, to actually be able to test their activity in their
providing accounting and tax framework predictable for three years.
Ecolo proposes that, at launch of its activity and provided he did not work
under the self-employed in the five years preceding the new listing,
Independent principally may opt for a flat withholding tax and social
up to 25% to respectively replace the tax on natural persons and
social contributions. This package would apply on turnover (CA) for the professions
liberal or gross margin (MB) for commercial activities or trading in order to stick to
better to the economic reality of the independent. Such a regime would be allowed only in cases
where the CA or the MB would not exceed € 50,000.
This system would create a significant administrative simplification. It would also allow
independent to face a predictable tax burden. Finally, it would allow the new
contractor to operate at their own pace, without having to overspend in operating costs and
from investments, which are tax deductible, but are in a debt prices
often insurmountable; these are three essential elements to test its serenity
activity.

Proposal: Calculate the social contributions of the self on the basis of
annual income
Ecolo has always taken the fight to simplify the calculation of social security contributions for bonding
possible to the economic reality of the independent. Government not advanced
can therefore only be welcomed since they are intended to allow to modulate the amount of contributions
Social payable based on the annual income.
Nevertheless, Ecolo ensure the proper implementation of this reform. It should, in fact,
ensure that the social insurance funds play the role assigned to them by informing
independent, in the beginning of each year, the possibility of modulating their contributions and time
to do it. Without this, there is concern that the rule of calculation of income based on contributions
remains the norm.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter INDEPENDENT AND SMEs - p 6/22

Proposal: To simplify and adapt administrative procedures
To simplify administrative procedures required independent, Ecolo offers:
A realization of the motto "Only once" 13 by improving the management of data flows
between different federal and federated entities to the independent no longer have to
transmitting data if the latter are already available elsewhere;
An administration outreach work with business realities so that it identifies
better the medium on which it acts. This measure is consistent with the generalization at all
levels of government, an 'SME test', which aims to verify, before
promulgation, that legislation will have no adverse consequences for small and
medium enterprises. For example, projects could be subject to
variable sampling accounting offices for SMEs;
A decrease in response time on the part of the administration. For example, it
Often an independent wait for a response to his request for exemption
social contribution between 6 and 12 months ... The rhythm of administration should also take into
the account of the company that requires fast, accurate answers.

Proposal: Improve and simplify public relations tools
accompanying and / or companies and independent financing to
drastically shorten response times
In recent years, it has been possible to observe greater efficiency in both public tools
supporting businesses in the financing of these. But efforts
consistency, simplification of procedures and improving the flow of traffic
information is still needed. Moreover, it is observed that the response times are still
unduly long especially compared with other countries or regions. In addition, the same
approaches, such as the realization of a business plan or simply a financial plan are
subject to different criteria between public tools.
ECOLO calls for a simplified and consistent methodology be developed by the dome of
economic tools decided by the Walloon Government. We must seek to ensure that a project
developed by a company accompanied by a public tool or heavily financed by
the government is using a methodology and criteria for the tools
Public funding to take over integrating what has already been written as study
market, financial and project description, not by repeating these studies. By
Moreover, the time to give answers to applicants for aid, grants and financing
are still too often very long. Benchmarking with the best examples
foreigners will inspire a drastic shortening of these deadlines.

Proposal: Simplify the available aids and improve information
Aid to self-employed and entrepreneurs are many, both in
regional and federal levels. But know them, find them and choose the ones that suit
consumes time and energy which the contractor is often lacking ... Therefore Ecolo
proposes to consolidate and make them more readable and promote these as federal aid
regional via a single website to quickly see the support can benefit
the company. This must be preceded by an assessment, at all levels of power,
various types of existing aid and adapt them if necessary to business needs.

European Commission, "Small Business Act - Think Small First: Priority to SMEs," June 2008.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter INDEPENDENT AND SMEs - p 7/22

Proposal: Simplifying access for SMEs to public markets
To allow better access for SMEs to public procurement, it is appropriate to conduct a
reform of European and national regulations in this area. Until now meet
a tender generates a series of red tape while entrepreneurs
often have too little time to spend on such tasks.
Therefore Ecolo proposes to facilitate the lives of entrepreneurs:
sensitize SMEs in public procurement and to create support cells for y
meet and pre-selection of markets suitable for SMEs;
free to gather all tenders from all levels of government on a
single website;
granting companies reasonable time (between 15 and 30 days) to provide
all necessary documents and advocate more systematically the principle of
confidence via a generalization of sworn statements. This system works
very well in France, where official documents must be provided after
the final award of the public contract;
to allow all businesses, and especially small businesses, to answer calls
supply, limit the use of the revenue criterion in tenders and
promote the division into batches for a very small company can seize more
easy part of the project. The bank must also provide players
sufficient bank guarantees to enable SMEs to participate in public procurement;
to introduce, when setting public procurement and social criteria
environment that would allow companies receiving certification in
these areas to obtain a more favorable rating at the time of allocation
markets.

Proposal: To ensure fair competition
Belgian companies, mainly labor-intensive such as construction,
are increasingly facing competition from foreign companies or Belgian companies
install a head office abroad. These companies are misusing cost differences
wage gaps and the European single market and put businesses evil
hire local people.
It is essential to find ways to curb this phenomenon of competition. Ecolo offers
a series of measures to maximize the impact of public investment on local employment
and on SMEs. These include:
strengthen controls of social compliance and security within the framework of possibilities
offered by the Directive on the posting of workers;
fight against the statutes of "false self" that dilute the chains of responsibility
and play into the hands of big companies unfair;
include in public procurement, social and environmental clauses;
provide certification and quality labeling schemes;
deviate abnormally low tenders.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter INDEPENDENT AND SMEs - p 8/22

Proposal: Supporting young entrepreneurs via structures
accompanying and multiplication of places of welcome
Federal and regional entities must free up space to increase the real places
host and support initiatives, including private, leading to the creation of business centers.
These spaces must both be designed as workplaces available at start of activity

to minimize the business launch expenses, but mainly places for meeting and
sharing experiences between entrepreneurs.
Ecolo therefore intends to encourage the creation of minimal surfaces dedicated to economic activity via
installing offices or small business areas within cities. In Wallonia as
Brussels, Ecolo intends to promote the availability of sites specifically to small, medium
or independent.

Proposal: Reduce employer contributions due during the engagement
first travailleurs14
In recent years, various initiatives to help SMEs were taken. Among these is
the Royal Decree of 4 March 2013 to harmonize and simplify the reduction schemes
social contributions, which allows the employer to benefit for a few quarters
flat reduction in employer contributions for the first commitment, 2nd and 3rd workers. In
October 2013, the regime applicable to third worker was extended to the 4th and 5th workers.
Ecolo supports this premium reduction for the first job for many
years and had filed successive legislative proposals to this effect. It will be important to
preserve the relevance and sustainability, organize the monitoring of these devices to optimize
efficiency in terms of creating and maintaining these jobs beyond the periods covered by
contribution reductions.

Proposal: Encourage employer groups
This device allows multiple companies to share any working time of some
employees to absorb extra work or cover sharp or seasonal needs.
Ecolo proposes to simplify the use of these groups so that they become tools
business development and job creation.
The broad outlines of the reform are:
the expansion of public workers that can engage groups
employers, previously limited to unemployed jobseekers long term;
the possibility for employer groups to offer employment contracts
are at least half-time if workers wish and not just on time
full ;
the possibility for employers' groups to be exempted from VAT, to benefit
financial support and advice to organizations whose objectives are to support them
and to promote their existence in the long term.
Nevertheless, to prevent possible abuses and to ensure a good quality of employment, this
expansion of public workers and the easing of contractual conditions must
accompanied tags: the establishment of a priority rule against workers
group does not have a full time, in order to increase their working time;
strengthening social dialogue in companies; the setting up of rules to ensure that

particularly the proposed "re-articulate the aid for employment in the service of employment."

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter INDEPENDENT AND SMEs - p 9/22

Employers' group of workers can not be discriminated against, in terms of
remuneration vis-à-vis the group of workers of member companies; establishing
an approval procedure for groups of employers.

Proposal: To fight against entities and payment delays
public enterprises
The amount of unpaid bills by public entities remains too often important and these
delays often lead to harmful consequences and sometimes even fatal, for SMEs.
More than liquidity problems, delays are to be the cause of many
faillites15.
For that government to be exemplary in this respect, it should:
Effectively reduce the statutory payment periods to a maximum of 30 days
working for entities and public enterprises. The recent federal reform opens
possibility of exceptions up to 90 days while leaving the parties free to agree a
longer period for payment on behalf of freedom of contract. It seems obvious that
power relations that are played between public entities and companies are often
to the detriment of the latter;
Legally compel public authorities to pay for themselves indemnities
delay. It is important that entrepreneurs do not have to claim them or to perform
other specific steps to obtain payment;
In Wallonia, the litigation out a series of subsidies to companies for records
accelerate payment terms. Indeed, payment of a subsidy to an operator
passes through the legal department from the time when the operator requested and
obtained an advance of a banking organization and therefore that the latter
asked the Walloon Region to guarantee the payment of the grant to an account
credit available to that organization;
Resolve disputes in connection with late payments or not, that may exist
between companies (Business to Business - B2B) through the establishment of a B2B mediator
for the resolution of conflicts between companies outside judicial framework;
Create compensation funds. Indeed, the slow payment of government
can be considered one of the direct causes of the bankruptcy of many
businesses. The problem is particularly serious in the event of a late payment
public body, the company should continue to meet its obligations vis-à-vis the
VAT, Social Security and the other and sees impose fines for delays. These companies
are being increasingly denied access to public procurement. This is where crates
compensation would have an important role to play. They play an intermediary role
between the company and the authorities concerned in the event of late payment.
The contractor could then sell its receivables from a public body to this
compensation fund when they have not been paid when due. That it
would be paid directly and not having to do it himself approaches
necessary to cover the debt. The redemption of these debts would no charge
additional. This compensation fund would then be recovered from
administrations concerned unpaid debts and default interest owed to
full right.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter INDEPENDENT AND SMEs - p 10/22

Proposal: To accompany the growing business
It is significant to note, despite the existence of numerous bodies
supporting businesses, the majority of their services are dedicated to the creation
activities or support for retraining in case of difficulties. Ecolo also wants
defend an approach to the accompaniment of the growing business, especially when you know
that the majority of failures occurs after five years. A leader or company could thus Head
enjoy development councils be given an analysis on new markets
conquer and opportunities to forge strategic partnerships, or finally be offered
External diagnostics to help them control growth. It is necessary that the
tools and public bodies to support economic activity are, above all, in the service of
real economy rooted in the territory. SMEs and TPE therefore be given priority support
to their local roots.

Proposal: Ensure stable and sustainable funding of wickets
Business
These machines are usually the first port of an independent or leader
Corporate strikes when he launched his business. They play an indispensable role in
the accompaniment of the contractor and generally assume the role of intermediary with
administration. Now coaching and quality support requires resources. Ecolo
wishes and increasing their skills go hand in hand with the necessary means
these key actors.

Proposal: Delete the Starter SPRL
Launched in 2010, this device allows novice entrepreneurs to create a company
limited liability without endorsing the imperatives of the establishment of a minimum capital
compulsory, the minimum threshold of the latter being increased to € 1. For Eco, such a device is not a
incentives for business creation or a gift to entrepreneurs but a decoy. Create
business can indeed hardly be done without starting capital; believe otherwise is
therefore an illusion. Given the low utilization of this form of society and dangerousness
such a system, Ecolo demand the deletion.

Proposal: To promote specifically the creation or redeployment
independent and SMEs towards sustainable development
Transversely, it is to combine the action of all the tools, mechanisms and
education policies, training, support and funding to foster
creation, development, redeployment and transfer of businesses towards the
sustainability. Public authorities, economic support tools and
financing, competitiveness clusters, etc. must work together to implement
various measures to stimulate creativity, business creation, support and
financing that facilitate the emergence of a sustainable economy. Thus, financial means
must be allocated to specific policies to these goals for SME sector
priority for the transition such as energy, mobility, food and housing.
In the same way as for the environment, sustainable development implies that the
Business social character is strengthened transversely. Drawing on an approach
Positive economy, creation and development of businesses that fit in along
term and also designed a social betterment and well-being of their stakeholders should be
supported.
It must among other things:

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter INDEPENDENT AND SMEs - p 11/22

to incorporate into public procurement criteria favoring high business
social added value;
to bring the traditional sectors and the social economy to increase synergies,
partnerships and integrated sectors;
allow sufficient public funding for companies that seek a triple value
added in terms of sustainable development.

Proposal: To simplify and harmonize export aids in region
Brussels and Wallonia
For Ecolo, in order to facilitate SMEs research new markets, it would be desirable
to improve relations between the two regions:
by harmonizing aid and incentives;
strengthening, improving and developing the tools, structures and resources
Existing abroad;
by facilitating and encouraging cooperation between Walloon and Brussels companies
in their prospecting efforts abroad and pooling their resources.

PRIORITY 3: IMPROVE ACCESS TO FINANCING FOR INDEPENDENT AND
SMES
In these difficult times for the economic redeployment, it is fundamental for Ecolo
also offer access to financing tracks are different ways of banking
classic for Belgian entrepreneurs and to fight against evil and cumulative scores by
the banks. Indeed, 13.2% of companies said they had been facing problems in
seeking bank financing, against 12.8% in 2011. Among those who have requested
bank credit to finance investments, 43.1% say they have encountered difficulties
in their search for funding. A percentage that rises to 55.4% for companies
having made budget requests to finance the cycle of exploitation16.
Too often, freelancers and entrepreneurs suffer from a lack of information about
the requests and denial of credit and as to the evaluation criteria for the conditions for granting.
Each bank must give reasons for its negative credit decisions in order to enable the company
to review his case and to improve weaknesses. It is essential that institutions
bank working fast and transparent information.
Companies remain too captive to their bank. In case of need a new credit,
bank hides behind the coverage levels available to it on any credits
existing and yet too often rely on personal guarantees which are disastrous for
SMEs, particularly micro enterprises. Also, if the entrepreneur wants to change banks,
administrative procedures are complex and financial costs arising which,
primarily of reinvestment allowances.
Given these facts, Ecolo intends to defend diversity in the sources of funding:
financing from conventional banks, with public interest organizations
that co-finance projects and independent entrepreneurs and through mobilization
citizen savings.
It should initially supervise the banking sector and to ensure that it is at
serving the real economy and thus SMEs and TPE.

BeCeFi Barometer 2012.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter INDEPENDENT AND SMEs - p 12/22

Proposal: To regulate the relations between banks and entrepreneurs to
more transparency
For Ecolo, it is essential that banks properly play their advisory role. So,
they must seek the type of loan best suited to the needs of the entrepreneur. Yes
the bank does not respect this obligation, the judge may order the amendment,
no cost of credit in a form better suited.
Moreover, in case of refusal of credit, it is important that banks inform the contractor
elements justifying its refusal or have negatively influenced the risk assessment.
This information must be communicated in a transparent manner and in understandable language
for the company. This will enable the SMEs to improve their credit record or even to seek a
another banking partner.

Proposal: Create a Green Savings
Belgian Ecolo wants to offer investors an alternative for a sustainable and inclusive savings.
Specifically, each bank would be obliged to offer among its savings products, a "booklet
green "offering attractive interest rates, with a maximum balance would be € 100,000 indexed and which
capital should be invested in sustainable projects.
The money saved would aim to support activities scoring balance
economic development and respect for workers, workers and the environment.
Could thus be financées17 SMEs, and individuals or companies active in the
green technologies or perform work related to the reduction in consumption
energy. The share of high savings oriented and could also be used to
financing of local communities and a sustainable housing policy. Banks should
ensure greater transparency regarding investments.

Proposal: Supervise reinvestment allowances
Repay in advance a loan or investment professional is too expensive to
Independent or business that wants or needs to repay prematurely. But pay
anticipation is often a measure of good management or obligation in case of difficulties
private or business.
For Ecolo, it is important to take measures that protect borrowers and
limit the profits that financial institutions realize the detriment of entrepreneurs. In
Indeed, the reinvestment allowances in cases of early repayment of a professional credit
are not framed and strongly skid, the contract explicitly provides for or not
Funding loss18 clause. This clause is unfair in terms of amount and the fact that it is
far from explicit in the terms of credit. Ecolo proposes to frame
strongly reinvestment allowances for business and investment appropriations. In addition,
compensation for making available to capital as part of credit facilities contracts
should be prohibited.

17
The funds raised will allow individuals but also to social housing companies finance
work to reduce the energy consumption of buildings, whether a renovation or construction
new. These funds should also allow to extend credit to SMEs active in the field of new
green technology or for investments that reduce energy consumption. These funds may finally
used to finance local governments, which face a drying up of credit and whose needs
community facilities are enormous.
18
This compensation corresponding to the difference between the loan rate and the current rate of investment over the lifetime
credit.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter INDEPENDENT AND SMEs - p 13/22

Proposal: To generalize access to "fixed advances" including for
lower amounts
Today the bank provides the fixed advances that from cash requirements
the order of 75,000 or € 100,000. Ecolo wants to prohibit the restriction of this bank produced some
quantified ceiling or as an independent entrepreneur must only borrow
sum it needs.

Proposal: Establish a "ready proxi" in our regions
Access to credit is particularly difficult for the "starters" of young companies
often lack capital and does not enjoy the confidence of the banks. These
starters can sometimes benefit from close support, but these take a long
risks meager benefits when they accept to invest financially in these projects.
To improve this situation, the Flemish Region has created the "win-win lening" by which a
person granting a € 50,000 maximum loan can benefit from a tax reduction
2.75% of the loan amount per year. This mechanism comes with a "guarantee" in case of nonremboursement by the company: 30% of the loan amount is then removed taxes or
refunded. This system works very well for a reasonable cost. Ecolo proposes to generalize
system "win-win lening" in all regions, under the name of "ready proxi" controlling
stronger source of funds for the fight against money laundering, and providing a discount
more important for SMEs working in the field of sustainable technologies and
the service economy.

Proposal: To support investment and the constitution
capital for SMEs
The budgetary cost of notional interest is very high, no real effect on the real economy,
employment, SMEs and Research and Development. Ecolo proposed replacing the system
notional interest deduction as it currently exists by strengthening devices
that allow companies to establish capital reserves, to use them for
develop and benefit from the same deductions as if they were using a bank loan.
The measurement of notional interest, created in 2005, did not present a single asset, the balance
the tax treatment of loan financing and equity financing, prompting
companies to be adequately capitalized. Only companies that have the greatest need
up more capital, namely SMEs, are unable to take advantage of such a
measured. Beside that, this measure has operated as a true "weapon of tax exemption
massive "for large and multinational companies have established their tax office in Belgium
without it brings real economic and social benefits to our country.
If the system of notional interest continues, Ecolo therefore intends to propose:
to better support the real economy and innovation by quadrupling capacity deduction
notional interest for SMEs (4.5% for SMEs) and for
R & D activities. It is in this area that companies and public authorities
must make a substantial effort to achieve our ecological transition
economy ;
to contribute to the fight against unemployment, conditioning, as regards the most
large companies, access to the deductibility of notional interest in maintaining the volume
employment in the enterprise;

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter INDEPENDENT AND SMEs - p 14/22

various mechanisms to prevent excessive tax deductions, eg
the use of techniques such as the "sale and lease back" 19 to increase artificially
the company's equity.
Ecolo but believes it would be more appropriate, and bearing in terms of business development and
jobs, to boost existing measures in favor of investment such as the deduction
Investment tax credit and risk capital, the latter being reserved for SMEs. These
measures targeted support for investment and capital formation in order to invest
and are much less likely to be misused by companies
willing to make aggressive tax planning.

Proposal: Promote and support participatory funding initiatives
Alternative sources of funding used to facilitate financing of projects
for innovative entrepreneurial project leaders who do not necessarily have a history
favorable bank. Crowdfunding - or collecting donations - such as cooperatives
funding tools are revitalizing and re-appropriation of the real economy by
citizens. Concerning crowdfunding, it is often in the first place, to raise funds through
Internet platforms. But generally, this community of contributors / users is
also a way to test the feasibility of the project to potential clients which will then
the necessary support to carry out this project.
The mobilization of local savings notably through cooperative structures is also a
innovative and participatory funding source. They allow citizens to mobilize a
given territory around economic development issues of proximity and offer them the
opportunity to actively participate in the implementation of local initiatives.
Crowdfunding platforms currently do not have own status as
Financial operator. As such, when they offer financial services to the public, they must
to submit to the same regulatory framework as major banks, which is a very labor
heavy for such structures. To promote the development of these platforms offers Ecolo
create their own statute that takes into account their specificities and specific objectives
they pursue. This status could still be controlled by the FSMA, as at present,
but according to different procedures, lighter and better suited.
Note that the development of alternative sources of funding with different eyes
on local development projects will only encourage women's initiatives
generally less focused on high profitability goals on creativity and the link
social.
Finally, Ecolo proposes that the European Commission present concrete proposals on
crowdfunding to encourage industrial projects at least 1 million € and the
support for the creation of locaux20 bond markets for SMEs.

Proposal: Financing the transition specifically companies
Complementarily and downstream of the Green Book, the loan proxi and crowdfunding, policies
Specific must be implemented to meet the financing needs of businesses
anxious to be part of a transition towards sustainable development perspective.
Thus, the economic tools dedicated to financing SMEs, such SOWALFIN, must
develop a specific strategy to integrate transversely in all their operations
the desire to create businesses, redeploy or strengthen sustainable economic activities and

to increase its own funds.
20
These local mechanisms for SME financing through bond issue, with limited risk for
private investors.

creation of quality jobs. Substantial financial resources must also be allocated
SMEs that are part of a sustainable perspective in the priority sectors of transition
(energy, materials, mobility, food, housing, green technologies, etc.). Possible
new aid mechanisms can be created to meet the specific needs of these
companies, such as guarantees or loans to support loans to improve the
energy efficiency and the use of raw materials by SMEs.

Proposal: To develop large-scale microcredit
Recent experiences of microcredit won some success in our country, in terms
creation of employment and economic activity by sometimes precarious public, who too
limited access to traditional channels for funding and support and lack of
basic managerial skills. Microfinance can figure essential tool for the fight
against unemployment.
With a view to improving the financing microentrepreneurs, tools
Public funding must ensure developing specific mechanisms through microcredit
adequate financial means.
The private sector should be encouraged microcredit by the government, including through
more flexible prudential rules on collateral in exchange for close monitoring of
part of regulatory authorities. Traditional banks will be encouraged to offer themselves, as
microloans to less favored groups (downscaling).
Microcredit towards sustainable activities should be promoted.

PRIORITY 4: SUPPORTING AND SUPPORT INDEPENDENT IN DIFFICULTY
Proposal: To provide a more adequate support for independent if
roadworks long term
The law on compensation independent when public works requires
changes that may be made during the regionalization of competence.
Ecolo has to put on the mat the condition requiring a total closure of the establishment
for seven days to qualify for compensation. Indeed, it is preferable to
undo the legal relationship between compulsory closure and payment of compensation
compensatory since it is obvious that the closure will always be the ultimate choice of the independent.
Furthermore, prior to the launch of public works, public authorities should consider
the consequences on businesses.

Proposal: Establish a "subsidy rebound"
Ecolo wants to give the needed boost to the self difficulty that can be
saved from bankruptcy. Thus, a "rebound allowance" should be paid monthly in
Independent whose business is in trouble. This does by no means a post-bankruptcy insurance but a temporary mechanism for the independent for delivery
sufficient to save and redirect its activity. This allocation is consistent with the support of a
support structure. It aims to supplement income or allowances
Independent struggling so that it has greater financial resources and the poverty
can thus devote himself to rescue his business.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter INDEPENDENT AND SMEs - p 16/22

Proposal: Develop a real policy of "second chance"
It is widely recognized that the fear of failure and stigmatization resulting constitute
major impediments to entrepreneurship. Failure can and should be synonymous with "fresh start".
In this sense, despite the improvements made by the Government sortant21, Ecolo
proposes to allow the independent benefit twice from social insurance in case of
bankruptcy or for a total period of 24 months.
This insurance will be granted to the independent after a bankruptcy order that the
recognized as being in good faith. Moreover, in case of a second bankruptcy, the payment of
Insurance will be conditioned to a support by a specialized structure to that third
Departure is good.
Today this "insurance fail" enables the independent preserve social rights
for four quarters and receive an allowance of about € 1000 / month for a year.
However, this benefit can only be collected once. Ecolo wants to support these
contractors for the "second chance" is not the "last chance".

Proposal: Reforming the Commission Exemptions
In case of serious difficulties, independent turn most often to the Commission
Social Affairs FPS exemptions in order to obtain partial or total exemption of their
social contributions. The decisions of this Commission point of too much arbitrariness
and take time to fall. Indeed, it is not uncommon that the Commission ruled that 12 months
after the introduction of the request, but the reasons for the decision are justified.
Ecolo therefore proposes:
that the Commission give an opinion within three months of receipt of the complete file
and justify its decision to the independent. In the absence of response within the period
time, the exemption application shall be considered adopted.
a clear legal definition be made to the "state of need" in which
Independent wishing to take advantage of an exemption must be. In order to end
the legal uncertainty surrounding this concept and customize Rights
Independent, Ecolo proposes to launch, in consultation with the sector, a reflection on the
establishment of objective criteria to quickly independent of whether
may or may not benefit from such aid.

Proposal: Establish a solidarity fund replacement assistance
There is currently a register of independent Belgium substitutes (database
allows the independent finding a "self-replacing") but this tool is still little
used despite the awareness campaign launched by the federal government. To remedy
this situation and to support independent beset by difficulties, proposes the Ecolo
up a solidarity fund to replace aid.
This assistance is intended to ensure that the replacement done by "replacing entrepreneur" ensures a
minimum income equivalent to that of the integration income for isolated (€ 817.36 / month first
September 2013). Eventually and after having had the opportunity to prove its effectiveness and usefulness, Ecolo
proposes that this fund could become permanent and binding. The funding would come from a
independent voluntary contribution (1.1% of quarterly contributions). This assistance would be

21
This insurance bankruptcy has indeed been extended to the "vagaries of life" that require the independent to close his business
(accident, fire, allergy). The new version also allows you to split the four quarters for use
several times during the independent career.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter INDEPENDENT AND SMEs - p 17/22

reserved for certain compelling cases (primary period of incapacity and disability, maternity leave,
palliative care to a child or to a partner, care for a seriously ill child).

PRIORITY 5: TO ENSURE INDEPENDENT AND INDEPENDENT LEVEL
OF DECENT LIFE

Proposal: Harmonize the social status of self with that of
employees
There are currently still too many differences between the social status of self and the
employees. The different level of minimum pension from a separate isolated and isolated an employee
is not justified. Ecolo proposes to align the social status of the independent on that of the employee
the name of social justice and equal treatment.
The minimum insurance coverage is independent, even today, less than that of
employees although the gap is gradually reduced for 10 years. Ecolo calls for all
workers, in exchange for their participation in the financing of social security, have a
identical to the minimum income benefit pension, incapacity, disability and
Family allowances.
In a similar vein, Ecolo wants to promote the search for solutions, structural and
viable for all the stakeholders, the "status" of "false self", this particular
for independent choice with neither conscience nor they accumulate disadvantages of each
status.

Proposal: To ensure a decent retirement for independent
Ecolo offers:
A minimum pension for independent equivalent to that of employees with
same binding requirements to well-être22;
The total abolition of penalties, "malus" yet granted to those who
taking early pension. This deletion is gradually being
production. It should ensure its finalization;
To ensure that the pension of the first pillar provides independent, as for
employees a decent minimum income for workers.

Proposal: Dedicate early access right to the retirement pension for
Independent Disabled Workers
People who, despite a handicap, choose to pursue an activity
professional are today, with the exception of the possibility of a pension for incapacity
physical in the public sector and some provisions with limited effects, subject to the system
common in terms of age and access to pension conditions, their activity is employed or
independent.
Or disability often weighs heavily on the exercise of the professional activity. It increases,
firstly, drudgery and decreases on the other hand, the average life expectancy. It therefore seems
fair at enabling persons with disabilities, if they wish, to access
in anticipation of the pension. Ecolo and wants the worker or the worker who exercises
22

For more information on the proposed Ecolo on this, see Chapter "Seniors and Pensions".

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter INDEPENDENT AND SMEs - p 18/22

independent professional activity while justifying permanent incapacity for work
At least 66% can apply to have these years of work to account for 1.5 years
work, entitlement to the pension and can be anticipated.

Proposal: To establish compensation insurance for workers
Independent with disability who want to refocus
When an independent worker is unable to work and wants to resume
partially his professional activities, he continues to partially émarger insurance
sickness and invalidity for 6 months, renewable up to 18 months. Conditions are authorized
the medical officer and the match between his professional activity and affection it is
achieved. However, current legislation states that the renewal is up to 18 months
granted only if the self-employed includes part of the activities it performed at the time
where the incapacity for work status began.
Self-employed workers who, due to illness or accident, is left with a disability
Physical incompatible with the resumption of his previous activity can not benefit from this
helps more than six months (renewable once) it is moving towards a professional activity
compatible with his disability.
Given this situation, Ecolo wants to allow the change of activity when the activity prior to the state
Disability is no longer compatible with the new physical state of the worker. It is indeed not
fair to consider that the self-employed remains in the job he knows and
which it has a customer to benefit from a 18-month period of partial resumption of activity in
Leaving disability, while the self-employed who changes job to adapt its
new activity to his disability is only entitled to a partial resumption of six months, renewable
times.

PRIORITY 6: SUPPORTING FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Networks of entrepreneurs like Diane Network UCM or that of "Mompreneurs" is
are structured in recent years. For Ecolo if targeted measures should be taken (see
below), all the proposals of this chapter meets the needs of women
female entrepreneurs by adding a prism reading these proposals. For example, it
could well be possible that women entrepreneurs and / or men
Entrepreneurs are a group of employers to hire a set
welcoming children approved by the NEB. Similarly, the development of alternative sources
financing with a different perspective on local development projects can not
encourage women's initiatives generally less focused on high goals
profitability and more on creativity and social ties.

Proposal: Promote women's entrepreneurship
Only 30% of people now decide to embark on the entrepreneurial adventure
are women and this percentage has stagnated for several years. But for Ecolo it
is necessary to further encourage and support women who want to start their own business.
Most usually the brakes put forward by female entrepreneurs or women
who renounce get their business are the link between work and private life,
access to a network and access to finance. Remains a social issue that must be addressed, the
social representations that do not place the woman as "entrepreneurial model".
Given these facts, Ecolo offers:

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter INDEPENDENT AND SMEs - p 19/22

Give visibility to independent workers, particularly through
Ambassadors of female entrepreneurship;
Support networks of women whose "moms entrepreneurs" to encourage
mentoring, dissemination of good practice, exchange of information and advice;
Allow the creation of women's business incubators with a tax incentive
for common nurseries;
Raising awareness of a business (banking, accounting ...) to
female entrepreneurship;
Better funding for women's projects;
While inform entrepreneurs of the possibilities of financing methods
cooperative because they often correspond better to their management methods and their
projects ;
While informing entrepreneurs and assist if necessary in participation in
employer groups that combine networked, project and complementarity
sharing resources;
Improving early childhood care facilities and hospitality for outside school
take into account irregular schedules related to most independent activities;
Establish, on the basis of voluntary contributions, a replacement fund (see above) which
allow partum women to be replaced, keeping the link
with their activity which may well continue for the necessary period of rest;
Facilitate the transition from employee status or that of unemployed worker
via independent income guarantees, support for cooperative activities and
women working in the nursery business.

Proposal: Extending maternity leave for self-employed women
Ecolo proposes that independent can benefit from a maternity leave of at least ten
weeks (instead of currently 8, and 15 weeks for employees ...) with the possibility
to initiate or replacing or helping in their work (in connection with the
setting up a solidarity fund proposed replacement using). Ecolo offers
also establish a paternity leave for self-employed for a period equal to that of
employees. Such mechanisms would preserve these first moments between
independent and their child, while opening the possibility of maintaining a level of activities
enough of the company.

Proposal: To allow monitoring of its activities by an independent on leave
maternity without loss of benefits
It is important to allow independent monitoring to ensure a minimum of its activity all
benefiting from the maternity allowance: audit trail, followed by the processing of a file,
checking inventory ... so that the active staff during the period of severance
Motherhood can be framed as a minimum. This is therefore to authorize conditional exercise
partial self-employment while being able to seek independent-replacement via the
Register.

EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING
Job creation and
quality training
Status and political horizon
State of play
In 2013, the Belgian situation of the labor market remained problematic and characterized by high
high unemployment since there were 12.5% ​​of unemployed persons nationwide,
19.9% ​​for Wallonia and in Brussels 20.8% (against 8.7% in Flandre1). This situation is
Of particular concern, especially for children under 40 years and, even more, for
under 25 where there has been a decline in the participation rate and a higher rate
significant unemployment. Indeed, in 2013, the youth unemployment rate of under 25 rises
27% - is the highest rate since 2010 - and the employment of these young people has decreased
approximately 20,000 units2.
Beyond mass unemployment, the deterioration in employment is an ongoing process that continues
worsen. The permanent contract (CDI) which represented the most auparavant3 form
used and coveted in the organization of work (because it gave a certain job security and
the possibility of projection into the future) is often converted into a series of such contracts
"Precarious". These include fixed-term contracts of very short duration, times
partial or temporary contracts, whose common denominator is often the flexibility
and the lack of safety for workers and the workers concerned.
To this is often added drudgery (physically and psychologically difficult) and
that said schedules "atypical": night work, breaks in work, etc. Atypical contracts
currently represent 40% of total employment contracts (27% of part-time contracts
and 9% of contracts for temporary work) and are often forced.
These precarious contracts mainly affect women (44% of employed women work
Part-time against 9% of men; they represent 80% of all contracts
part-time) and young. They rarely allow workers to live in
decent living conditions and often maintain in a situation of poverty. That's what
-called "working poor" and working poor. Currently, there are 4.2%
Poor workers in Belgium including 6.4% in part-time contracts (against 3.1%
for full-time workers) 4.
Moreover, the number of work accidents is increasing and more and more related illnesses
develop work such as stress, anxiety, anxiety, burnout or even suicide. The

causes are known and relatively clear: the competition between companies, some
management practices, individualization of negotiation on the rights of work5 a
related pay, recurring threats of dismissal, removing the
early retirement, etc. The consequences of these changes in work are individual
puisqu'impactant workers' health and privacy (alteration of family relationships,
decline in the share given to recreation, etc.) but also collective.

The political horizon Ecolo in employment and training
The need to create jobs
For Ecolo, staying at this level of unemployment is not inevitable. It is essential to mobilize
all public and private levers to create jobs in Belgium, particularly in the
green sectors (sustainable construction, renewable energy, sustainable food, green chemistry,
management of resources and waste, etc.) and new services to the community
(notably to face the challenges of the demographic boom and the extension of the term
life) ; all ensuring working conditions respecting the welfare of workers. In the
home services sector, Ecolo also intends to develop a real approach
Complementary between, on the one hand, home help services and other, service vouchers.
It is also necessary to be able replace the current system of aid for employment - whether
regional or federal - to real employment service. Too often, aid is not conditioned
the maintenance or creation of jobs and then used tax relief - especially for
companies that can benefit from advice on tax planning - and turning away
initial philosophy of the device.
Improving the quality of employment and ensure respect for workers
Disastrous working conditions experienced by certain sectors and certain
specific populations (unfortunately often the same as those previously pointed)
must be improved. It should thus promote the extension of the term of certain contracts
creating groups of employers, for example, while ensuring that the conditions
financial and employment security are preserved.
The valuation of some sectors based answers to real needs
people is also important (education sector, health care, etc.). There
economic productivity can not be the only factor to take into consideration for the issue
wage standards; social utility is essential in this context, particularly for trades
which fall within the personal assistance, education, etc.
Ecolo also wants to review the concept of suitable employment so that it really takes into
consideration the realities of workers and persons likely to return to work and
it provides decent living conditions.
The discrimination faced specific groups (women, youth, people from
immigration, etc.), especially in the Brussels Region, must disappear to their
also allow access to employment.
Innovate to develop another relationship with time and better share the available work
Transitions between periods of activity and inactivity associated with the discontinuity of paths
Professional multiply, often giving rise to insecurity, isolation and
stigma. Ecolo proposes to introduce transition systems allowing everyone
to live a decent income while reconciling work and private life, individual well-being
and collective, personal training and activism. It is also to propose a

Just a few decades, labor law was defended strong way by collective labor agreements. TO
Currently, there is more and more individualized professional relationships and, therefore, a more
low worker's defense capability against his employer.

actual policy for young people, in particular by allowing them to combine first
work experience and training time, citizen engagement and development
skills, while ensuring sufficient income to find their independence. It's here
why Ecolo offers young contract to prevent them from falling into the spiral
infernal non-employment.
Today, too many people are still struggling to find work while others work
too much. This does not prevent these two "groups" of experiencing stress, anxiety or
mental illness can lead to more serious conditions.
Ecolo intends to reopen the debate on the division of working time so that everyone can find its
place in society and live in material conditions and decent welfare. It is well
to set up a real "political time" that allows everyone to combine life
professional and private life. Ecolo recognizes intermittent work and the choice of
Workers wishing to organize their jobs around temporary activities. It should therefore
ensure its leadership and vitality.
Too many people are trapped in their jobs and are unable to benefit from the services
primers such as those offered by utilities. Fixed and off-center hours of reality
their users also contribute to congestion in urban centers. Like what
practice in some countries, Ecolo intends to promote and support negotiation mechanisms
collective social time, especially at the commune level (businesses, governments ...)
and living areas (transport, schools, administrations ...).
"Training" rather than "format"
Training should be seen primarily as a way to learn. Too often,
envisaged under the sole prism of "ready to use" and thus loses the essence
foundations. Ecolo may consider training in terms of formatting
adéquationnisme with the job market. For this purpose, training should be done with
the persons concerned.

she is

and of
and for

Ecolo also intends to promote access to training facilities for low-skilled public.
Too often, it is these audiences that are affected both the labor market and on offering
training. It is therefore essential to focus on training schemes in respect of these public
maximizing their chances of emancipation and access to the labor market.

The Ecolo force lines

renewable energy, eco-renovation and eco-construction, sustainable food, etc.), the industry
non-commercial or linked to the social economy, to local services, production and sale
Local products, Horeca, transport and logistics, culture, tourism, etc. The
short circuits are integrated fully elsewhere in this logic as it is reduced to
maximum intermediate in the production and distribution, which leads to develop
the local economy and proximité6. Companies operating in these sectors contribute
inevitably local economic development and job creation, and are in
the logic of sustainable development. If these two sectors are significant deposits
jobs, it does not result in less interest in supporting other sectors or businesses such as
small and micro businesses that are also a considerable number of jobs and sometimes part of
significantly in the logic of short circuits and durable7 development.
Furthermore, facing the new challenge of the sixth state reform, which provides a significant transfer
a series of "employment" powers to the federated entities (employment subsidies, service vouchers,
ALE 60/618 items, followed by jobseekers, education leave, etc.), Ecolo wants to improve
social efficiency of employment support systems and service vouchers. These two devices
represent, in effect, very large budgets and may give rise to the emergence of
new quality jobs.

Proposal: Promote the creation of sustainable activities in the sectors, capital gain environnementale9
Today it is to trigger proactive public policies and better targeted that
contribute to the ecological transition.
Alliances Job Environment
Regional governments, led Ecolo, have understood this since, under
Alliances Job Environment Agency (EEA), they launched hundreds of actions to support the
business development in these sectors and by promoting collaborations
public, private and voluntary. These alliances aim to meet the challenges of employment,
training and education through the economic opportunities created by policy
proactive environmental. The many and varied actions concerning various sectors
(sustainable construction, water resources and waste, sustainable food, etc.) as in Wallonia
in Brussels Region. It should continue and amplify:
introduction of incentives for both individuals (creation of a single window,
advantageous financing, lower interest rates, etc.) and businesses (creating
a label to encourage SMEs to reduce their environmental impact, access to credit
bank for SMEs that engage in energy-saving investments,
etc.);
granting employment aid to help companies develop their transition strategies
to green building and make time to implement this strategy;
implementation of training in green sectors (sustainable energy management in
buildings, passive house design, waste management, etc.);
etc.
Research and Innovation
For Ecolo, the priority is investment in the areas of research and
Innovation through which are laid the foundations of wealth creation for tomorrow. For it,

new jobs. Public investment policies and employment policies should aim
primarily those sectors.
New green technologies
It should also invest in new green technologies (NTV) that favor
energy saving, production of clean energy and recycling, for example. These chains
are rich in employment opportunities and meet the social and ecological transition
of the economy.
Among these "eco-prosperous" sectors, mention may be made of eco-renovation of the housing stock
and eco-housing construction, green chemistry (bioplastics and biofuels, biopolymers)
engines with better performance and lower polluting, renewable energy
(including green energy), sustainable agriculture, diet quality, multimodal logistics,
public buildings (schools, sports halls, community infrastructure ...), infrastructure

Proposal: To support the non-profit sector, sector to gain sociale11
The non-commercial sector continues a nonprofit and its resources are not exclusively
shopping. It comes in different sectors such as health, social action and
diverses12 association activities. In 2010 the Non-Profit Institutions (NPIs) - more
commonly known ASBL - numbered 18,700 and employed 446,500 employees,
representing 12% of paid domestic employment. The production of the latter amounted to 33.7
billion, representing 4.5% of the total production of the Belgian economy. This activity
production has generated a gross value added of nearly 20 billion euros, so
the weight of the associative sphere in the gross domestic product (GDP) stood at some 5.5% 13.
There is therefore a need to develop non-market activities when they meet
many societal needs. But there is also an economic interest in terms of jobs
quality to create, especially since the mid nineties, the average annual growth
employment are reached 2.8%, against less than 1% for the whole of the Belgian economy. Under the effect of
economic, demographic and social factors, the demand for personal services of this type
probably will increase even further in the future.
This application is regularly insufficiently solvent and therefore the supply of such services is
largely dependent on public subsidies or is provided by the public sector itself. For
Ecolo, the complementarity between public action and associative action is more than justified in
regard to the added value and delegated tasks assumed by this non-commercial sphere, in
terms of social ties, assistance to people, participation in social, economic and
cultural and civic education or training.
Various measures can be taken to increase employment in these sectors, with attention
particular to the quality of employment provided that the workers and the workers concerned are
often face unstable statutes, insufficient salary conditions, or even to
working conditions or strenuous duties.

Thus, in the context of strengthening employment and quality of life of workers, expects Ecolo
forward to the implementation of commitments made by the Governments of Cocof, the
Wallonia and the Wallonia-Brussels Federation within the framework of the "associative charter". This one
provides in particular that the authorities now will favor multi-year funding
associations that fulfill general interest missions. In addition, Eco proposes to extend
this principle to the so-called emerging associations (not subsidized in a structural legislative framework).
Ecolo also proposes that the financing of non-market employment provided by the Federation
Wallonia-Brussels in the framework of socio-cultural grants meet the standards of the law
existing work. Where collective bargaining agreements do not exist (arts
for example), governments have a duty to contribute to the emergence of agreements allowing
improve the quality of life of non-profit workers. Ecolo also intends to extend the
Maribel social mechanism to the cultural sector as labor relations characterizing it
are complex and are illustrated by a multitude of spécificités14.
In the Brussels Region
The non-commercial sector generates more than 230,000 jobs (FTEs) in Bruxelles15, public sector
including (100 FTEs outside 582.4 administrations and public services) and offers beautiful views
Job to Brussels (Brussels almost one in two works in the non-market). If we
abstraction jobs related administrations and public enterprises, the non-profit
still corresponds to a little less than a fifth of total employment. The number of jobs
in the non-market in Brussels by thousand inhabitants is well above the average
countries and this is obviously reflect this specificity for socio-economic development of the Region. The multiple needs social and health matters facing the
Brussels territory require significant reinvestment in these sectors, both in
the creation of day care places of accommodation for disabled people
as, for example, for new homes or new medical homemaker services.
There are hundreds of jobs that could be created as well, responding simultaneously to rate
very alarming unemployment of the Brussels Region and social needs.
Regarding support for workers in these sectors, Cocof decided in 2007 to adapt
career purposes by the implementation of the Plan Tandem and by early retirement measures.
It will continue to be very attentive to these issues in order to support the dynamism
Professional of these sectors in the greatest interest of the beneficiaries of services. The last
2010 agreement allowed to act on the purchasing power and the trade union allowances and to
up a team to implement the law on well-being at work, mainly in the
small structures. This type of measure should be extended to other industries and widespread
in all entities.
In Wallonia
Finally, in Wallonia, the sector generates more than 360,000 jobs (FTEs), including public sector
(213 FTEs outside 590.5 administrations and public services), and also offers good prospects
Job to Walloon (almost one Walloon two works in this sector) 16. The last agreement
between Wallonia and services affects nearly 20,000 people according to the cadastre of employment,
particularly in the areas of health, social action and social and professional integration,
and aims uncomfortable hours, the granting of leave, compensatory employment costs
transportation, trade union allowances, social dialogue and cooperative security fund.
For Ecolo, it is essential that these conventions are rapidly extended to new
sectors, also called self-deploy to their activities, such as, for example, the sector
the environment and the new technologies. Similarly, it is important to support efforts

to consolidate support policies of the elderly and people
disabilities.
For all entities involved in the non-market employment, Ecolo defends the idea of ​​a
harmonization of workers' statutes and systematic sustainability of agreements
with the sector, as is the case in Cocof.
Ecolo also proposes to produce a register of multi-funded positions to make
light on staff working in structures financed by several entities. This will

Simplified partnership with various bodies subsidiantes but not prevent research
based double subsidiations.

Proposal: re-articulate the employment aid to the employment service
The landscape of the employment aid is complex. It includes federal measures, measures that
will be regionalized in 2015 and measures that are already regionalized. It comes sometimes in
activation allowances, sometimes reductions in social contributions (employers and / or personal)
or down tax. Despite the transfer of skills - that will double the
regional budgets - federal budgets are still important.
Generally, Ecolo wanting to fill employment support schemes granted
private sector to maintain or create jobs and respect for collective criteria.
Furthermore, Ecolo also plans to build on transfers régional17 level:
harmonize the system to make it readable for both employers and
workers;
linking aid for employment more functional policies for non sector
Merchant and for local authorities.
Condition the employment aid when they are granted to employers in the sector privé18
In recent years, public employment subsidies to businesses have increased
in the legitimate objective of supporting the development of business and employment, and in some
case, guide the choices of companies (commitment to particular categories of workers ...).
These public subsidies are complex, yet too infrequently conditional on
maintaining or creating jobs, leading to windfall. Thus, despite their
large profits, some companies benefiting from public aid decision to conduct
layoffs.
Ecolo proposes mandating the repayment of public aid to the perceived job
when a company is not in difficulty making a collective dismissal, take its
activities or relocating them, then it makes a profit before tax of at least 5% of its
revenues on average over the last five financial years, excluding deductions
notional interest as these still exist.
Companies can benefit from derogations from the obligation to recover
received public aid if, within the company, stakeholders (the Corporate Council
or union delegations) unanimously recognize the need for such a restructuring,
because the economic outlook or adjustment of the company's strategy. In case
disagreement among stakeholders, the exemption is maintained on the condition that

It should be noted that transitional periods will be scheduled as part of the transfer of powers
and that, de facto, the establishment of a new system will take place gradually. It will
also ensure minimize interregional competition.

Ecolo A bill was tabled in the House (53K2003). Recall that the employment aid granted
non-profit sector is already conditioned to job creation (cf. pooling structural cuts
under the social Maribel).

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING - p. 7/36

the company has invested enough in training its personnel19, so that
it can incorporate new skills and reorient themselves in the labor market.
Note that :
this conditionality is already applied in the context of EU structural funds and
that in the non-profit sector of social Maribel;
this proposal would be successful if, after its entry into force, it
brought nothing to the state budget. This would mean maintaining employment in
companies receiving state aid and therefore the return to certain values ​​of the economy
real.
Note that, beyond the maintenance of employment within the company intends to package the Ecolo
employment aid to respect for collective criteria. Indeed, the European Union, through its plans
transversal or via liquidation of structural funds, forcing regions to develop
Specific policies for categories of job seekers excluded from the labor market
(young people, low-skilled workers ...). The regions may therefore depart from this principle. It
being, they can still improve the system by conditioning the granting of such aid
compliance with collective criteria or guidance of entreprises20.
These criteria would relate to the choice of the company in training (eg compliance
standard of 1.9% - see below), to retirement planning for older workers (eg
development of specific time for these workers), integration of young asylum
employment of low-skilled and young workers (eg, type of contract, welcome, tutoring ...)
Investment to maintain the level work tool (eg share of income devoted to
investment and research), wage policy (eg ratio between the least wages
higher and higher), etc.
It should be noted that this conditionality must be understood according to the type and
size of the company. It would be incoherent and irrelevant effect, for example, to apply this
conditionality for a TPE or SMEs that would recognize a small number of
workers.
Moreover, aid increases (as direct aid) would be implemented in
certain conditions, including whether the company, in addition to meeting the criteria of job quality
mentioned above :
is active in a "Holder" sector economic development (eg sectors
Activity 2.vert Marshall Plan), or are of major social issues or is a TPE,
a small business or self respect. The idea is to direct part of the aid to the
sectors "carriers" while respecting of course the European aid legislation
State;
began a collective reduction in working time; this additional aid
encourage companies to make the attempt and would de facto a better distribution
profits in favor of labor.
Regionally, simplify the system of employment aid and align to make the
readable for both employers and workers
The current regional arrangements mainly concern the non-profit sector and
local authorities; except the merchant EPA, now the SESAM device (support
employment in the merchant business sectors). Federal devices "target groups",

19

Progression of financial efforts of 0.1% annually to 1.9% of payroll, and increased rate of
5% participation in the average training per year, reaching 50% access of workers.
20
Today, the logic of the employment aid is strictly linked to the worker. The company that undertakes this type of
job seeker is entitled to a fixed support. This system allows a maximum aid for some employers
unrequited. The windfall effects are many.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING - p. 8/36

transferred to regions further concern the market sector (except for certain jobs
PTP, SINE, Activa, which are used in the non-profit sector or local authorities).
In short, the system of aid to employment is complex; it is therefore necessary to simplify and harmonize
all existing measures to make them more readable and service of all.
Concretely, it is to limit the number of measurements and the overlap thereof. he
is also differentiated by sector measures notably by distinguishing three sectors
which would be linked aid for specific use:
the market sector;
the non-profit sector;
public policies (CPAS, municipalities, education ...).
On this basis, Ecolo offers:
Maintain a system of aid to employment linked to the individual
Whatever the sector, employment aid should primarily help to promote
those categories of commitment particularly vulnerable or discriminated on the market
employment. This is particularly the young, the elderly, people with low
skilled, foreign workers, etc.
This aid must therefore be used to correct the market and provide access to a profession.
For the non-profit sector and the public sector, further linking aid to policies
Functional
It seems hardly acceptable to untie completely the system of aid to employment
employment policies to put certain categories of unemployed. It is difficult to envisage
imagine the scenario where aid to employment would disappear and the corresponding amounts
would be transferred directly into the functional budgets.
However, with the transfer of aid to employment, the regions have a margin
maneuver much more important. Before these devices were conditioned to maintain a
device as part of a strict policy against unemployment. Now it is
possible to envisage a different use of budgets and adopt an approach more
coherent, particularly in supporting the voluntary sector (culture, early childhood,
professional integration, support and care for the elderly and / or disabled ...) and
public services (municipalities, CPAS, education).
Specifically, Ecolo propose21:
ensuring the maintenance of the level of aid and the current level of employment in the sector
associations and local authorities;
greater functional integration of policies and employment policies. The
Minister must have functional support the distribution of resources according to priorities
sector policies under its responsibility, the Minister of Employment are, in turn,
responsible for setting the cross working conditions that concern all
targeted workers. This approach should allow to allocate resources based on
regional priorities, first and determine prospects for work on the
medium / long term (and out of stroke by managing the coup like "response to the
demand "or" gift to friends "), on the other part22;
the establishment of definitions and more objective criteria, in particular to clarify what
falls functional policies (granting of aid based on the needs of

his training, length of unemployment ...).

Proposal: For an integrated home services policy
The service voucher system was instituted in 2001 to develop local services,
create jobs and fight against undeclared work. This system subsidizes (at 75%) the
provision of home help activities for essentiel23.
Since its inception, this device is experiencing a continued success.
necessary for the provision now approved in more than 920,000 utilisateurs24.
128 986 workers in the first quarter of 2013 including 125,825 women, or
secteur25. Today, the system is still growing, even if there is a
development.

2529 enterprises
The Social Security accounted
97% of employment in this
slowdown in

This success is explained largely by the importance of public subsidies granted even if
these have gradually been reduced in order to control a little better fiscal position (the
service vouchers expenditure represented in 2013 more than 1.6 billion, excluding tax reduction).
In 2014, the user buys a service voucher to 9 euros for the first 400 checks purchased
(10 euros for the following 100 checks). In addition, it benefits from a tax reduction of 30%.
The authorized company receives for its part, in addition to the share price, a subsidy of 13.54 euros per security.
Every household can buy a maximum of 1,000 titles per year.
If this device, which was a resounding success, helped put the employment of thousands of
workers and meets the needs of many users, it can however be
amélioré26. Indeed, he led in certain types of businesses to create jobs
low quality (especially in companies or temping in the commercial private sector), it
is an exorbitant cost for public authorities, resulting in significant fraud in
of certain approved undertakings, fraudulent bankruptcies, competition with services
home …
In this context, in recent years, the federal government decided to frame the more
device (stricter approval, most important controls, faster and granting of compulsory
permanent contract workers ...). There remains much room for improvement.
Improve the system of service vouchers
For Ecolo, it is essential to ensure, as part of the transfer of this system to the regions, to
applying the following principles:
improve the quality of employment and service relationships within the titresservices device;
improve the financial transparency of the device and control it;
avoid possible confusion between services provided in the context of securities services and
Chartered support services to families and older people and strengthen
complementarities between these two sectors;

23

Specifically, the allowed activities are:
- The activities carried out instead of the user's residence: home cleaning (including windows, laundry and
Ironing), small occasional sewing, meal preparation;
- The activities carried out outside the place of residence of the user: doing household errands, transportation
accompanied disabled, ironing (including mending linen board)

more support to organizations that display a better "social performance"
(quality of available employment, quality of the service relationship) than others. Indeed,

the level of service vouchers, studies highlight "performances
social "very different between the organizations.
Improve the quality of jobs
For Ecolo, the quality of employment in the service voucher remains too variable. Ecolo offers
the application of the following measures:
offer as soon as possible and prioritize a full-time contract for women workers and
workers, if they so wish;
introduce a minimum framework in the service voucher structures (TS);
strengthen training - the training fund that was established was never fully
used;
modulate reimbursement to undertakings on job quality indicators
(seniority, type of contract, working time ...)
better pay travel expenses within the joint committee 322.01;
continue strengthening business checks service vouchers;
continue to strengthen the procedure for approval of business service vouchers;
ensure that the contract between a user and a certified business titresservices take the form of an agreement signed by both parties (tasks,
hours and days of service, equipment, means of access to the home, conditions set
in the absence of user or worker) and results in a home visit from a
framing member of the company, in the presence of the worker.
Better organize services at home so that they are complementary
Ecolo also wants to better organize the various local services so that they are
complementary.
To do this, Ecolo wishes:
limit the tasks that can be performed by the service vouchers to current activities;
establish a binding agreement with a family support service to
reorienting the most vulnerable users to these services when this is (or becomes)
necessary.
Calculate the financial participation of beneficiary service checks depending on its capacity
contributive
Ecolo finally proposes to calculate the financial contribution of the beneficiary of securities services
based on its ability to contribute, as for the family or household aids aids fare
social. This would allow both to establish a fairer system and reduce the cost to
authorities.

PRIORITY 2: IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF EMPLOYMENT, THE WELFARE WORK AND
SHARING OF WORKING TIME
After multiple redundancies that our country has recently experienced is hope and
perspectives that citizens expect public authorities.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING - p. 11/36

For this it is necessary to abandon the short-term responses which place the burden on
workers and the unemployed. We must develop innovative formulas that allow access
employment while balancing the singular needs of each individual. Measures
securing career paths, time sharing of work and development of
(late) career encounter between precarious and public employers, social involvement ...
must be developed. All this must be considered in parallel actions reorientation
economic activities towards the service of the people, to SMEs and to those sectors of the
ecological transition that are not be relocated.
This is the logic of the new social contract that fit the following statements.

Proposal: To facilitate the access of young people to employment
The first job is the most difficult to acquire, while often the
provided that the commitment by employers anxious to get the services of workers
immediately operational. It is a paradox to be solved, with the risk of a generation
workers sacrificed on the altar of the economic crisis.
Ecolo therefore proposes the introduction of a young contract law as open to all youth aged 18 to
25 years (or during the first two years after leaving the school system) to live a
first relevant professional experience, in good conditions. This contract is young
a real alternative to employability training (former waiting period) and must allow
young out of school, who wishes to exercise a community service that meets
real needs and for which he was offered a 6 month contract (renewable once). The contract
young should not be equated with the transitional training in that it allows participation
all young (no degree of restriction) and are not exclusively revolves around the
training and professional integration. Indeed, through its exclusive establishment in
local authorities and associations, it also highlights a social approach and
citizen.
The youth contract is therefore a possibility for every young person who wishes to train,
discover the world of work and to engage in the social field, cultural, sports, rather than being
forced to inactivity in the course of professionnelle27 insertion.
The young contract would gain real work experience and skills
useful for a future career. The youth contract is primarily on exercise
municipality within municipalities and CPAS or within recognized associations (sector
non-market). It would also be possible to exercise the contract in the territory of another
Common in its catchment area or participating in international projects. The young
could also perform an activity or more assignments for one or more employers
different during the contract period. The young contract could, of course, not replace
a regular job, why it would be limited in time.
The whole time would be devoted in part (half-time for example) in the workplace and partly
(the other half) in search of employment or training. The part-time "work" would be
paid at the minimum wage and largely subsidized by the government. The mitemps "job search" enable the young to take time to present its
application to employers, undergo training to learn about a job ... In
This half, the young could be stand alone or be accompanied.
The exercise of a young six-month contract would be sufficient evidence for the activation
Insertion benefits. Similarly, the young contract could be abandoned if the youth is a
employment elsewhere (or continued if the job is part-time and consistent). The costs of
travel would be reimbursed, as in a normal employment contract.

27

The waiting period became the employability course at 1 January 2012.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING - p. 12/36

The device would be accessible to all young people, skilled or unskilled. Care should be taken, in
do, to offer a variety of activities including the following examples: a young athlete or
resulting coaches and teams of a club; or a young one which reinforces the Pole "logistical"
a nursing home; or a young person who participates in a reconstruction site during a
ecological or humanitarian disaster; or a young accountant who strengthens service
"Finance" the CPAS; etc.

Proposal: To facilitate the access of people in precarious employment 28
Make precarious meet public and employers is an original way of giving back to the first
Looking to the future, to enable them to project it and thus promote a real work
reintegration.
A privileged means of rehabilitation is to provide access to steady employment, quality,
fulfilling, adequately paid, and if possible, indefinite (CDI) ensuring a
specific framework adapted from the professional relationship created. Many dare
even dream of yet a different approach to the issue, such as IOD method
(Intervention on the Supply and Demand), proven for over 25 years in France, allows
bring together public and insecure with employers, the key, a significant proportion of
permanent contracts and high employer satisfaction rates as
employees.
This paradigm reversal is roughly no longer require the age-old
"Adequacy of jobseekers in the labor market" but rather to work intensely
on and with employers to convince them not to hire employees
on the classical basis of their CV but on their ability to meet the specifications inherent in the
task to be assigned to them. For the employer, the gain is that provided by the organization
both through the selection in the discreet accompaniment of the worker and monitoring
his relations with colleagues and the employer at the beginning of their contractual relationship. The employer
also earning a professionalization of its recruitment process.
It should indeed be noted that most employers in Belgium are SMEs and that it is they
which are the poorest in recruitment procedures. Most bosses are
Therefore applicants from support at this level.
In Belgium, at various places, such as the Brussels Region, in Liege CPAS or
Regional Mission for Employment in Charleroi, this method has already been implemented successfully.
We propose to generalize its application in the different sub-regions in collaboration
with the Regional Employment Missions and other field workers and via grants
enabling the establishment of social work teams able to go on contact with
employers to persuade them to give a chance to precarious workers and support
the start of this new relationship.
Such an initiative can have a leverage effect on the rest of the labor market, allowing
each perform work in connection with its real skills and helping small and
medium enterprises to ask the best choice recrutement29.

Proposal: Improve the quality of employment (contracts)
Precarious contracts, part-time, temporary or fixed term, generate revenue
unstable, variable and often inadequate, a claim often inconsistent scheduling flexibility
with a decent quality of life, in short, insecurity and unpredictability.

28
29

The proposal is included in the Chapter "Fight against poverty".
See on this subject our proposals in Chapter "Social Security".

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING - p. 13/36

These contracts generally affect specific populations (women and youth)
and specific sectors (the so-called areas "feminine": household activities, health and
social action, various services, etc.). It should be recalled that it is women who are
majoritaires30 in this type of contract: 44% of women "at work" are included in
part-time contracts against 9% men; women represent 80% of total
part-time contracts. But only one in nine women said they accepted a time contract
partial voluntarily They are therefore are mainly by stress due to
the lack of day care for children or caregivers to a sick relative, because
no alternative in the labor market is offered to them, etc.
Ecolo offers:
improve the quality of employment contracts, to fight against the precariousness of workers;
Ecolo meant, for example, to ensure that part-time worker to know
his schedule more in advance or priority to increase their working time
when engagement opportunities present themselves in the company and can, in
facts, be entitled to a fixed schedule extension in case of endorsement (for service hours
extra) with successive contracts;
enhance the income guarantee allowance (salary supplement paid) for
persons holding involuntary part-time;
to fight against the diversion of acting for the purposes of job insecurity and
strengthening the rights of temporary workers including safeguarding contract
working from day mission.
Ecolo also proposes developing and facilitating groupings employeurs31 (see above)
including strengthening current experiences, valuing the approach from
social partners and expanding the opportunities offered by the legislation.

Proposal: Redefine the concept of "suitable" employment
In Belgian legislation, the concept of "suitable" employment intervenes at three levels:
to assess the legitimacy of a job abandonment, since a worker became unemployed
subsequently a job abandonment may suffer a penalty if employment was abandoned
"Suitable" and if the abandonment is not justified by legitimate reasons;
to assess the legitimacy of a refusal of employment, since registered as unemployed
job seeker is obliged to accept any "suitable" employment offered to him;
to assess the market availability of employment of an unemployed person, since
job seeker can not submit resuming his work "to reservations,
given the criteria of suitable employment, are unfounded. "32
In practice today:
many cases of litigation concerning the abandonment of position;
penalties for refusal of suitable employment are rare (the job does not show
as an offer "to contract"); but the penalties for non-response to invitations
(refusal to participate in a recruitment procedure) are numerous and undoubtedly
often linked to the definition of suitable employment. The dispute therefore lie
upstream of the job;

the penalty for unavailability for the labor market is no longer
systematically detected ... but this element is part of the overall assessment in
the control procedure "active search behavior";
and the concept of suitable employment applied to struggling workers in their jobs
represents a considerable leverage over workers, to whom it is advisable to
not to resign to avoid trouble with the National Employment Office.
However, the current regulations on suitable employment is inconsistent, unfair, disrespectful
international and questionable texts on juridique33 plane ... She has also been the subject
a recent review that aims to harden the conditions of suitable employment (inability to
refuse work less than 60 km and limited period during which the person can refuse
Employment is not related to his qualifications and / or training).
Ecolo offers another new definition of "suitable" employment: as it serves
reference, it must incorporate the concepts of "decency", "quality" and "sustainability".
To do this, it is necessary above all to clarify that the notes of a suitable job
shared responsibility of all governments (setting rules,
accompaniment ...) on the one hand, and all economic actors and employers (respect
of regulation, respect for the dignity of workers ...), on the other.
It is also essential to reassure the job seeker and / or worker by resting
the burden of proof in case of dispute, not on his shoulders alone, but by obliging
government to investigate the quality of jobs and employment.
Furthermore, Ecolo offers:
to better take into account the family and social environment (presence of young children
age, disabled children ...), particularly to meet the international texts
matter;

of hours worked during the day and duration imposed displacement (eg. in

Proposal: Reduce stress at work
We live an absurd paradox: some are unemployed and depressed; others work
and suffer from excessive stress. In both situations, suffering significant affect
seriously people's health. This suffering mainly reflect an imbalance
in the allocation of time and the burden of travail37 and a loss by the worker
mastery of his working time. Increasingly often, employers do not require the
worker to work during the hours that are paid him more but he meets
the result of requirements regardless of working hours required to attain these
requirements.
Stressors explicitly perceived by workers are above all
the intensification of work and its consequences for the relationship to time and to others. This
intensification alters the organizational culture: the culture of competition is required; she
dries human relations in the work environment (no consideration,
recognition, solidarity and justice; competitive bidding ; isolation).
What appears particularly alarming is not only the magnitude of the phenomenon but
especially the aggravation of the differences between protected and quality jobs and those in precarious
and exposed to stress. Working conditions are increasing inequalities and widening risk
which submitted the most vulnerable. The hyper stress at work reflects the fact
discomforts that new does not replace the old but they ajputent to, the
induces an intensification of work.
Work stress is manifested through various symptoms: fatigue, irritability, sore
head and back, sleep disturbances, difficulty concentrating, eating disorders ... To
deal, workers develop two types of conduct: the attempt Avoidance (stop
disease to blow, change of employer, early retirement ...) or individual action on
symptoms (play sports, take drugs, drink alcohol ...).
For Ecolo, the root causes of stress at work fall within the functioning of our societies.
This stress is rising sharply and toxicity confirms that it is indeed a real problem
public health. So it is that we must act collectively.
In this context, Ecolo offers:
improve, in general, working conditions and act on the causes of stress
chronic ;
integrate time organization at work in the criteria to be met in
Mandatory provisions relating to the welfare to work;
to review the operation of External Services for Prevention and Protection (SEPP) and
also modaliser their action towards SME / SOHO and ASBL to be more
operational on the ground;
to study the financing terms of psychosocial aspects-prevention counselors
SEPP and think of the consultations by the independent funding;
educate employees and employers in various aspects of work stress,
including its root causes, as well as raise awareness of the role of SEPP
(occupational medicine and risk management);
enable workers to have access to the best technical support of the
stress and its consequences, such as anxiety and depression;
organizing speaking places in the company, to foster solidarity among employees;
37

According to the research report "Work and stress. If they attacked the evil roots? "Of Solidaris (December
2012): one in three workers is suffering from stress due to the high working or very high (which can lead to burn out and
mental exhaustion); only less than two out of ten workers do not feel stress almost; others - one in
two - live a moderate stress.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING - p. 16/36

to organize places of exchange for small patterns and to assist SMEs in
managing relations with their workers.

Proposal: Identify and harmonize social standards
Nationally, there is unfair competition between small businesses and franchisees
mass distribution. For Ecolo, it is not possible to maintain such a situation and
must now submit to the same rules and franchised supermarkets for
social law and opening on Sundays and holidays.
At the level of the European Union, the legislation currently does not fight
effectively against "social dumping" via the posting of workers.
Indeed, we find that:
many posted workers are unduly presented as independent;
minimum working conditions and employment are often not respected;
companies "mailboxes" who use the Posting to circumvent the rules
in employment, multiply;
companies with a transnational activity (air, road, maritime)
away fictitiously considering the legislation than the usual place of occupancy
worker is the place of signature of the contract;
cascade subcontracting allows complex legal arrangements favoring opacity
labor relations.
Faced with this situation, positive measures were announced and implemented at federal level
201238 in: increasing the number of controllers and inspectors; establishment of a
responsibility solidarity between the client and the contractor for the social debts
tax and for the payment of remuneration in the construction sector;
Electronic registration requirement of attendance of workers on construction sites
temporary or mobile; improved exchange of information between inspection services ...
These reactions are nevertheless insufficient. Ecolo propose39:
to protect the rights of workers in the airline, maritime and
road, raising ambiguïtés40 for applicable labor law and jurisdiction
competent;
extend the application of the law on the distinction between employed and
self-employed - already applied in the sectors of construction,
surveillance and security, transportation of things / people and cleaning - all
the secteurs41;
to amend the directive on the posting of workers in the framework of a
provision of services to determine the maximum duration of posting (the country
of origin), so as to fall on the principles of the law where the worker or the worker
habitually works and thus enforce a minimum wage and
create a European social inspection service;

38

Federal Government: http://plusdemploisetdanslesregles.be/.
Ecolo has filed a bill in the House (53K2212001).
40
The ambiguities relate to the choice of the application of standards; Indeed, some companies try to enforce
other laws of the country in order not to enforce a stricter labor laws and more favorable to workers.
41

The current law establishes indeed a rebuttable presumption of an employed status when the analysis of the relationship
work shows that several criteria from a predetermined list is filled (eg lack of power
making in the purchasing policy; absence of obligation of result; work in premises where it does not own
or lessee; guaranteed a fixed payment regardless of the result; lack of authority to hire staff or be
replace…).
39

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING - p. 17/36

limit or regulate the posting of workers through temporary offices,
to avoid the lack of work permit and lending of staff by intermediaries
lack of approval for the private placement.
Social dumping, however, is manifested not only in European countries but around
well internationally with adverse consequences for workers but also for
the environment. Ecolo therefore proposes to introduce social and environmental duties
at européen42. This is a powerful tool that the EU can and must use
to exit the crisis and relocate the economy, which, in turn, will have the effect of reducing
transport needs and CO2 emissions. The establishment of such customs duties and social
Environmental therefore constitute a clear added value on the grounds of both economic,
social and environmental.

Proposal: Limit voltage salariale43
The limitation of wage inequality level is an important issue. Ecolo supports
increasing number of social minima. Ecolo also supports limiting
income senior executives and managers of public companies, with a ceiling of
remuneration (fixed salary and bonuses) highest to, for example, ten times more than the average
low-wage sector. Note that currently, it is not uncommon - particularly in the area
Financial - the highest salary is one hundred times higher than the lowest wages.

Proposal: Share the available work
Today, some people work too much or, others too little or not at all.
The Belgian labor market is characterized by a very uneven distribution of working time, the
weight of part-time work are especially represents more than a quarter of total employment. The
unemployment and the number of involuntary part-timers are rising. The number of hours
Additional worked also ...
Furthermore, changing work schedules, work intensification and increased burst
working hours are leading to growing desynchronization of social times. And of
Again, inequalities are evident. These are the low skilled, women and
youth proportionately more are faced with irregular schedules and
imposed schedules (no opportunity to participate in determining their work schedule,
impossibility or great difficulty to free emergency ...).
It should also be noted that unemployment more for the young and the elderly (in
Wallonia, for example, a job seeker in five under 25 and an applicant
Employment in five over 50 ans44) and the part-time affects women more (near
one in two women undertook part-time for almost a man on dix45). Faced
the difficult harmonization of family and professional life, women are in fact more
induced to accept part-time jobs ... and thus also to give up a career, a
some income security and professional independence.
For Ecolo, working time issues are also global and collective issues, which
must be treated as such. Ecolo estimated that the current measures in this area are
largely insufficient. That is why Ecolo proposes to share the working time
available.

Between generations
At present, on one hand, young people generally aspire to get a job and to forge
first professional experience, while on the other, older workers
aspire to lighten their workload. However, the first struggle to find work and the latter
to modulate career endings under advantageous conditions.
Solutions exist and are already working to meet this generational challenge. Ecolo
proposes making the Tandem Plan, set up in the non-profit sector under the leadership
Ecolo (rainbow sky Government) accessible to all économiques46 sectors. His
principle is simple. It's about :
to lighten the workload of older workers who wish, allowing them
switching to part-time or three-fifths time and sharing their skills and
their experience to younger, while limiting their loss of income. Like this,
older workers will also continue their professional career more
long;
to allow young workers to live a first professional experience,
replacing seniors, and being formed by these elders. In this way, these young
workers could be included in the labor market;
facilitate the transfer of experience within companies through mentoring, while limiting
costs for employers and ensuring the maintenance of the company's performance
by the contribution of forces and decrease the work load;
improve state finances and social security by increasing the number
workers and a decrease in the number of compensated unemployed.
The advantages of the Tandem Plan are numerous for the different actors involved (worker and
young or old workers, company and State).
It allows young people to form a first professional experience. If the wage is too
low, it will benefit from the income guarantee allowance to supplement their remuneration. he
may also have a second part-time contract, in the Tandem Plan or not.
The elder or the elder will benefit from a reduction of working time, allowing him to
extend their working lives in good conditions, facilitate the transition to the pension and
enjoy more time freed. Moreover, part time worked by older worker
completely assimilated in the calculation of the pension and its purchasing power is preserved.
The company, too, winning as there is a transfer of experience and anticipating
demographic changes. Financially, the transaction is neutral for the company (cost
Wage identical) or positive (lower wage costs in the case of a young worker) 47.
Finally, the effects are also beneficial for the state since there is a set of youth employment
job seekers and thus an increase of the population employment. It is also an
good way to accompany the demographic changes, as part of an operation
neutral from a budgetary point of view, wage differences and allowing savings
to finance this plan.
Ecolo wants the Tandem Plan is accessible to all workers, and workers
private sector companies. If 20% of older workers seize this opportunity, this
could allow nearly 100,000 older workers and older workers to reduce their

46

Currently, the plan is already paying off in some non-market sectors.
Specifically, the older worker receives:
- Half of his salary;
- The time credit allowance paid by the National Employment Office;
- Tandem allowance is recorded in a specific fund in the implementation of the measure.

47

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING - p. 19/36

working time and create 100,000 part-time contracts allowing young workers
workers to make their first steps on the labor market and out of chômage48.
In the event of restructuring
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008, many companies have closed and
Many workers were laid off.
According to the latest statistics on the FPS Employment restructuring, between January 2013 and
June 2013, 84 companies have announced an intention to proceed with collective redundancies, which
covers over 6700 travailleurs49.
Obviously it is appropriate, first, to try to limit the number of restructuring to
to avoid economic and social disasters. In this regard, and the following chapters
contain many proposals to redeploy the economy and create employment
quality.
However, beyond the necessary economic restructuring, wants to develop Ecolo
more solutions to limit the social and economic damage related to restructuring.
In this context, particular wishes Ecolo facilitate forms of reduction and time-sharing
work in a concerted manner and aimed primarily to maintain employment levels and guarantee
sufficient working income, notably for lower wages.
Ecolo wishes finally develop production cooperatives, by facilitating the acquisition
companies in difficulty on their own travailleurs50.
Between periods of activity and inactivity
At a time when employment is characterized by increased flexibility and a discontinuity
career paths (working periods associated with periods of inactivity sometimes
long), it is time to propose measures that facilitate transitions between activity period
and non-activité51 and that secure the route of the persons concerned.
These measures include the systematic development and negotiated all positions
activities that become here "transitions": periods of training or parental leave, period mitemps or combined with another half, associative eg partial reduction
working time at retirement ... These periods and these occupations combine activities deemed
socially useful to a temporary guarantee compensation (which can combine funders
Miscellaneous: public employment services, etc.), and are gateways to other positions
the work market.
These transitions are developed everywhere in Europe, but national differences are
strong. Beyond greater security for workers, this is obviously to aim well
a fairer distribution of working time and facilitate consequently the conciliation
between work and private life. The shapes that can take these transitional spaces
are multiple:
job rotation of replacing employees in training by a company
jobseekers previously trained at the workplace; this possibility is
the result of an ambitious partnership between the company and local employment services;
Labour foundations that mitigate the effects of restructuring
allowing the reclassification and training to those who wish or from while
Now those in employment or those who wish to stay. Here, the principle of solidarity

workers who have not made this choice can be kept within the company.
the time savings account that allows to accumulate paid leave entitlements or
receive compensation, immediate or deferred, in return periods

parental leave that provide a capital time to both parents so they choose
deliberately that will keep their infant or child and how. This allows to
promote the integration of women in this situation often penalized all
involving the father more importantly in his relationship with his child;
the citoyenneté53 leave that would allow any asset to devote time for actions
citizens, volunteers and activists.
On this basis, Ecolo offers:
the provision of capital and time sufficient replacement income allowing access
effective this type of mesures54. Each worker would have access to and really different
forms of career development: time savings account, parental leave, leave
citizens, etc .;
the development of partnerships between public authorities and companies to propose
joint actions of career security and capacity increase
labor mobility; the experience of job rotation (see above) in the Danish
material is to implement.
These two actions are articulated with other proposals contained in this chapter: the contract
young Tandem Plan, the sharing of working hours, etc. All these proposals are
innovative formulas transition that reconcile work and private life
while providing a minimal base protectionnel individuals.
For the collective sharing of working time to the agenda of negotiations
interprofessional
The collective reduction in working time can be an exciting prospect for
a transition to a more sustainable economy, for the environment, for citizens, for the
well-being of each and everyone and for the prosperity of our society. Beyond the Map Tandem
and measures to facilitate the transition between periods of activity and inactivity, new
work organization and taxation formulas should be made possible to allow
more people to work, causing also a better income distribution
and a better quality of life for everyone.
Ecolo wishes to encourage the collective reduction as well as the sharing of innovative formulas
working time to allow compensatory hiring. Ecolo invites partners
social to put these issues on the agenda, to make it a central theme of the next
interprofessional negotiations and define together the effective terms and conditions

European countries.

For example, the current time credit is limited to 12 months maximum on a career and allocation amounts relating thereto
between € 432.30 and € 576.40 for a "leave" full time; this temporality and these amounts are insufficient to
encourage workers to benefit from such measures.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING - p. 21/36

for income preservation, as well as facilitating business combinations, capable
to share working time.

Proposal: Promoting new forms of work improving the quality of
life
Telecommuting (telework), working on the go (mobile work) and coworking (work
together) are the new forms of work that respond, in certain circumstances, to
expectations of employees and their employers.
In fact, coworking is still not widespread. Mobile working is common, but few
recognized. Telecommuting is, meanwhile, often practiced, but it is the fact of teleworkers
occasional (eg "officers" who finish work at home parents - yet
often mothers - working at home on Wednesday for the same time, able to deal
children ...) ... and that telework is often "gray", that is to say, not framed by addendum
employment contract or an enterprise agreement.
Ecolo proposes to promote these new forms of work, reflecting the adjustment of
organizations ("management by trust" a priori), control the legislative tools (for
that these new forms of work are recognized) and their progressive development (eg
Teleworking can for exceptional circumstances such as bad weather, medical appointment ...).
This development, however, require agreements, including with the social partners, which
hold respecting the control of private-business time by workers and links
Relational sufficient to enable workers to participate in collective project
the company.
These new forms of work are therefore acceptable only with:
compliance with legislation on working time (which requires the measurement of time
work) ;
the actual separation between work and private activity;
Retention rights of representation of trade unions.
Otherwise the workers, especially the weakest, will see their levels of stress and
increased social pressure.

Proposal: Provide a framework for volunteering, the clarify and harmonize a
Europe-wide
In developing the 2005 law, the legislature, in agreement with the voluntary sector, stressed
the non-requirement of voluntary activity. A characteristic considered essential in
the practice of volunteering. However, this position is sometimes questioned aujourd'hui55.
For Ecolo, volunteering must remain a free act and free. All text and
proposals that affect volunteering should respect this specificity and facilitate procedures
to become voluntary.
Provide a framework at European and international volunteering
Under cover foundations or association "humanitarian", commercial enterprises offer
(sometimes at exorbitant prices) "humanitarian" trips. These corporations operate
the good faith of people who want to go as volunteers and use practices

55
For example, to obtain a social integration income in the framework of voluntary activity, unemployment is
conditioned to the "voluntary work" one day per week.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING - p. 22/36

disputed that seriously harm both the international voluntary sector as
people who welcome there and the volunteers themselves.
For Ecolo, it is necessary to clarify the objectives of each and to ensure recognition
Real volunteering - that is to say, that has no profit and whose organization responds particular
the training requirements of "CRACs" (Responsible Citizens Assets Reviews and Solidaires).
This recognition and this control must be coordinated at European level.
In addition, it is currently impossible for a volunteer outside the European Union to obtain a visa
to come to Belgium. He must therefore go through an application for temporary work permits.
Ecolo wants an exemption should be made possible for the volunteers.
We must therefore expand access to volunteering to residents in Belgium, what
his or her nationality or administrative situation. The law on the employment of workers
foreigners should be modified to allow them to be voluntary.
Clarify bureaucracy for job seekers
In order to exercise a voluntary activity and retain unemployment benefits,
Job seekers must declare their (s) activity (s) via a form of the NEO with their
Paying Authority (CAPAC CGSLB, CSC or FGTB). The latter has a period of twelve
working days to make a decision. In case of no response, the activity is considered
as authorized.
However, the job seeker does not always receive the same information based on the
unemployment office or place of residence.
It is therefore necessary to ensure the harmonization of procedures, both within the NEO as
payment agencies.
Harmonize volunteering at European level
The Belgian Law of 2005 provides in its Article 2, §1, that "this Law regulates volunteering is
exercised in Belgium and volunteerism that is exercised outside of Belgium, but
organized from Belgium, provided the volunteer has his main residence in Belgium
and without prejudice to the provisions applicable in the country where volunteering is exercised ".
In practice, this law is not always known and recognized in the other countries (most
of them have in fact no legal framework for volunteering). This can cause problems.
To strengthen European citizenship, one of the tracks is to facilitate volunteering
border. Several UN declarations and recommendations of bodies
Europe will also in this direction. We must at all costs avoid the volunteers who spend
the borders of their country are treated as workers. In this context,
mutual recognition of different statuses that exist in each state must be set
spot.

Proposal: Develop the innovative time policy
Rehabilitating working time as a condition of employment that impact daily on the
quality of life
The relationship between time and wages tend to polarize around two contrasting models:
The "flat" work, for example exercised by executives, subject to obligations
result. In flexible organizations, coordination of the activity and is based on a
almost total time availability of employees. And the company no longer has to worry
save "time" resource since it is more scope it into account.
Working time "effective" or strict counting of working time, which are
subject, for example, the techniques and surface technicians and cashiers and

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING - p. 23/36

cashiers supermarkets. Only productive working hours are paid; the
travel time, break times or training times are not
recognized. Persons under these schemes are often engaged in part-time ...
and asked to adjustments in working hours on demand.
Ecolo is concerned about such developments, which undermine the balance between work and life
Private, on the one hand, and behaviors that generate withdrawal and renunciation, the other
hand.
Ecolo wants to rehabilitate the working time as a condition of employment, in reconsidering the
as a protective third.
Enter these innovative policies in a broader time frame
As well as financial income, time is a critical resource. In an era
stamped by the frantic acceleration, hunting "dead time" and
overvaluation of production time and consumption, no political project can not be
ignore this central question. In this context, Ecolo proposes not extend more
opportunity to work on Sundays and public holidays (particularly in the context of the great
distribution), except in specific sectors such as care, culture, etc.
Moreover, as there is income inequality, there is also an unfairness against the time
available. Therefore, for Eco should be redistributed so that each time and
everyone has the means to take the time to live and participate in society and democracy.
Promote consultation and collective bargaining of social time
The rhythms of life are experiencing strong trends: shift work schedules or evening
weekend, growth in travel time, availability request
permanent via internet or mobile phones ... These developments lead to more trouble
in larger reconcile work, family life, leisure time, housework,
administrative procedures, etc.
To overcome the difficulties of articulation between hourly increasingly out of sync, the
Italian cities, and German and French, have set up "time offices", a
space for coordination between different actors (inhabitant-es, es-trader, public services ...)
for negotiating the adaptation of schedules of services to the needs of their users.
This negotiation also overcomes the problems of overload. Thus, the adaptation

class schedules from the University of Poitiers has reduced traffic congestion and
congestion of public transport, by slightly shifting the start of classes.
Ecolo intends to promote and support these collective bargaining mechanisms of social time,
particularly at the commune level (businesses, governments ...) and living areas
(transport, schools, administrations ...).
Encourage demonetization time
The time currency increasingly. Where new services for "busy people" is
grow as more (household staff remuneration to accomplish tasks
domestic, "personal shopper", "dog sitter", etc.), wants to encourage Ecolo
mechanisms of informal and non-monetary exchanges such as local exchange systems
(SALT). Indeed, these are designer ties and to social cohesion. These mechanisms
exchanges are not subject to tax or social security contributions in the case of activities
occasional exercised without enrichment goal.
Policies articulate time and urban / regional planning
To reduce the pressure on land reserves and energy consumption, as well as
promote meetings and social cohesion, Ecolo wants the facilities and public spaces

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING - p. 24/36

can meet different uses to different audiences at different times of the
day of the week.
Thus, on the model of "brede scholen» Netherlands, it is appropriate that the new buildings
schools are designed, from their design to be used for other purposes in the evening,
on weekends and during school holidays: social advancement courses, extracurricular activities,
parties, etc. Similarly for the integration of communal services (library, equipment
athletic …). This approach, coordinated with schools, allow for savings
of significant scale.
The design of public spaces too must now combine the needs of users in
different times of the day and of the week: for example, a square or a park shall
power, simultaneously or successively, offering relaxing and resting areas (benches ...) and
recreational facilities (playground, skate ramp ...) or host a market.
To encourage this approach, Ecolo wants to promote buildings and versatility criterion
public spaces, particularly at the architectural programs, and planning regulations
impact studies in town planning and land use. Ecolo also wants
encourage dialogue and co-financing of different networks and levels of power
(Regions, communities, provinces, municipalities) to optimize the use of these spaces
community facilities.

PRIORITY 3: INVESTING IN TRAINING YOUTH AND ADULTS,
UNEMPLOYED WORKERS
Education and training are essential for all adults, young and old, seekers
of employment or workers. They pursue both objectives distinct but part of a
same logic: allow people to control their destiny and participate as actors
the future of the société56.
Ecolo reaffirms its major principles:
We must "form" rather than "format", considering training as primarily
a way of learning; we must build on and with the public in formation, rather
than paying in adéquationnisme aiming exclusively "the ready
immediate ". This requires an integrated approach to training where clear contracts
between companies and training centers ensure reflect the realities of
trades and techniques to enable the improvement of training and ensure that
these courses provide skills that will enhance people
multidisciplinary and cross-cutting;
Public resources must be mobilized to form the least priority public
qualified (job applicants or workers); it would be interesting, in this regard,
establish a credit "permanent training" inversely proportional to the duration of
scolaire57 course;
Furthermore, Ecolo think it is necessary to:
fight against discrimination in access to training (affecting more
women, less educated public and fragile public on the plan
socioeconomic) ;

56
Recall that education is associated with a broad purpose of cultural transmission and personal development while
that training refers to a more professionally oriented, encompassing forms of knowledge distribution in a
work context, such as internships and training on the workstation.
57
This option would re-establish a balance between those who have access to a full tuition (which
represents a significant cost to the community) and other, more deprived in their youth.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING - p. 25/36

leave the choice to follow or not to follow a training; the training must be
considered one more chance to try to get a job or
increase opportunities for career mobility, not as a new obligation;
avoiding abandonment of training, motivation or frustration of people who
embark on a training process, mobilizing resources for help
orientation but also for adequate support;
enhance the positive self-image and therefore the skills and abilities of each;
develop new courses, which prepare for green professions and trades
tomorrow ;
simplify the training landscape and improve the legibility of the training course.
Specifically, these principles are divided as follows:

Proposal: Promoting green training, to ensure development
of growth sectors
Different sectors are promising, as the energy sector, the environment,
alternative transportation ... They have many opportunities. Energy audit, insulation of walls
and roofs, eco-construction, soil sanitation and polluted wasteland, water management and
waste, organic agriculture ... are activities for which it is particularly useful
to invest and thus to train staff.
Thus under the Employment Environment Alliance, specific training pathways related
with mapped needs by professionals in these sectors have been launched.
Employment, training and education and resonate through the opportunities created
a proactive environmental policy.
It should continue these initiatives. Ecolo offers for these emerging businesses:
to anticipate skills needs (3 - 5 years) and that, taking into account the
technological, organizational, regulatory and economic;
maintain the land registry of existing training and identify deficits offers
qualification ;
to involve all operators in the construction and implementation of
training plans;
organizing training by involving sectors to retrain applicants
employment and workers;
ensure an accessible training opportunities for both women and men;
develop social economy sectors, making emerging sectors base
a true social inclusion plan;
supporting training in ecology and sustainable development and / or
more technical specializations (eg environmental management, energy
renewable, basic socio-economic rights ...) in business schools in
schools that form the industrial and civil engineers, with agents of
Regional / local government administrations that play a role in the management of heritage,
when additional training (eg eco-consultant) ...
to provide support programs for business leaders to create
trajectories of skills, both for them and for their workers and employees.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING - p. 26/36

Proposal: Making orientation aid a public service
Improve degree recognition devices and validation of skills so
to make the most of the knowledge and achievements of each. In Brussels, more than 30%
for job seekers who are not listed according to their qualifications for
issues of non equity method.
The orientation aid goes beyond mere information. Guide a person is help
develop the ability to choose a training project, social inclusion and / or insertion
professional and provide the tools and support needed to implement it,
including having recourse to new and emerging technologies.
For Ecolo, the orientation aid must become a "core public service", available at very good
account (and free for job seekers) for everyone, all the time. He must
blur the distinction between educational guidance, career and personal and must
develop, if necessary, by being in contact with reality, to allow to discover
horizons.
For Ecolo, the service to the public should be organized within each catchment area. It might be
Driven Crossroads Employment Training (CEFO) true working partnership platforms
in synergy with the actors of education, CPMS, social promotion, Forem, Actiris,
Bruxelles Formation, IFAPME the SFPME, the consortium validation of skills,
licensed operators of socio-professional integration and associations active in the field.

Proposal: Refocus some training assistance devices for the benefit of
less qualified public
In general, the most vulnerable or farthest from the user have more public
great difficulty in accessing training or carry them out, causing fatigue,
loss of confidence, lack of social and cultural references, low adaptive capacity to
corporate culture and its unspoken, poor perception of the workplace ...
For Ecolo, so it is necessary to remove discrimination affecting access to
formation (tendency to recruit people who are most likely to carry out and
to succeed, since the evaluation of operators is on results in terms of insertion) or
the quality of the training offered (sometimes occupational training, lack of structure
teaching ...). It is also essential is to focus some training aid devices
on low-skilled job-seekers or to direct them so that they benefit more from the
persons who are or risk finding themselves in precarious situations (eg by modulating
the government intervention so that it is more important for workers
low-skilled).

Proposal: To support the socio-professional integration projects
The overall objective of socio-professional integration is to facilitate social inclusion and
Professional welcomed the audience, distinguishing the necessary time to both approaches. She
aims to lead to sustainable and quality jobs. This involves training and
not to format, giving himself time to reach the objectives. Several principles guide
socio-professional integration: the trainees are at the center of the devices being considered
in their entirety, with their life course, their cultural backgrounds, their realities
Daily, their psychosocial difficulties, gaps and weaknesses as well as strengths and
hopes; students are involved in their learning; articulation with employment is effective
and social skills are worked.
Since 2004, with the activation plan of the unemployed, the educational principles of integration
sociovocational are violated and confusion (between support and control) has
installed. Entry into the devices is less voluntarily and more

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING - p. 27/36

more for fear of loss of unemployment benefits. In this context and framing
reinforced activation, proposals to require long-term unemployed to work
volunteer to benefit communities prevent them to be part of a process
deformation. For Ecolo, it must focus on training for job seekers - and not the
forced volunteer work which unravels more travail58 conditions - so that they
can acquire new tools and strengthen their integration and market opportunities
work. Training operators (including training enterprises Work (EFT) and
Socio-Professional Integration Organisms (OISP); these two names will soon
replaced by the single name Centre Socio-Professional Insertion or IPSC) are
also in a difficult position as they have to accompany these job seekers
this particular context and away from the philosophy of training they defend.
Ecolo wants to stop this hunt chômeurs59 and redirect means that the controls
mobilize support to a friendly professional job seekers Project
and the creation of quality jobs.
Ecolo also proposes that:
the socio-professional integration operators can train the most people
distant from the labor market, in a clearer context;
these operators are regarded as true partners in education and
Public employment service, and they work together in each catchment area, from
to better articulate their actions;
EFT, OISP and Local Missions have a real fiscal space and
operational order, as part of their mission, experimenting with forms
innovative (to reduce dropout rates ...).

Proposal: Meeting the challenges of recruiting and critical functions
Recruitment difficulties, critical functions, functions in demand, shortages hand ...
are all terms used to describe the functions for which employers have
difficulties in finding candidates they want.
Ambient speeches are often reduced to pointing the finger at many unemployed
responsible for this situation "since they would not be able to fill the jobs
available ". Ecolo can not accept this simplistic view of reality, which aims to stigmatize
jobseekers and reinforce a negative image of them while contributing to
unravel working conditions.
In 2012, Forem constatait60 an average satisfaction rate global61 89% (the highest since
2006), an average of 31 days recruitment (against 34 in 2011) and decreased
number of critical functions (43 against 49 in 2011). The unfilled posts by concern
example, for Wallonia, posts of general nurse or nurse specialized care,
roofer, installer of sanitary and thermal equipment, welder, mechanic
maintenance, construction machinery driver ... and in Brussels of engineering positions,
an occupational therapist, teacher, foreman, etc.
The explanations are many: painful or dangerous nature of certain trades or certain
functions, low wages, discrimination in hiring, poor image of the profession, hardness
social relationships, lack of consideration ... but also lack of skills or training
sufficient for job seekers or a lengthening of the individual duration of vacancy
58

In this context, Ecolo refuse any conditioning unemployment benefits to voluntary benefits that
not allow people to seek employment, to begin a process of social formation and / or professional
and go against the respect for the dignity of everyone.
59
Ecolo has filed a bill in the Senate (511304).

Between labor demand of employers and labor supply provided by workers.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING - p. 28/36

which generates a discouragement, a deconstruction of the person and loss of know-how
leading eventually to a withdrawal makes the labor market and / or rejection by
potential employers.
The issue of "labor shortages" affects many hot topics: the system
education (why and how do we form youth?), vocational training (which assures?
how?), working conditions (acceptable? employment is it proper?)
economic migration (how integration in what context?) or mobility
Interregional (what are the real brakes?).
These themes are essential. We can scan a backhand. However, convey a
global discourse about shortages does not only accentuate the pressure on the market
of work and working conditions, but also helps send simplistic messages
on education and training policies, with political power and society
tune the economy.
Ecolo think, however, that further the meticulous work with utilities
Employment and the social partners in each sector and each territory,
better objectify these critical functions, review the way they are set, diagnose
the causes and resolve the specific problems of labor. Find concrete solutions
from field realities is challenging.
In this sense, the work done under Jobfocus funded by the Marshall Plan in 2.Vert
Wallonia and aimed, in particular, improve recruitment channels, increase the supply of
training and make them attractive manual trades, is welcome.
To increase job mobility capability of the workforce, Ecolo offers
also:
Develop soft skills and transferable knowledge, to give a
dignity and professionalism to individuals, with educational and cultural content, and
allow to adapt to changing contexts;
From a maximum of concrete work situations to develop skills
required;
Organize short training gateways between different trades;
Decentralize or locate specific vocational training in some
subregions, particularly for occupations where mobility is low (eg training aid
Family in the sub-areas where demand is high but where the training offer
is inadequate);
Ensure the adequacy of tools and technologies used in training and requirements
the labor market, particularly in the alternating education;
Demand sectors and companies a greater investment in training
and thus in the conversion of their workers (with tracking efforts through
an assessment of training activities);
Strengthen language training programs, particularly in regions
border and Brussels for the second language;
Improve the drafting and dissemination of vacancies;
Improve the accessibility of childcare (crèches, school care ...) and
the availability of public transport, to facilitate opportunities for training and work
parents ;
Organizing forms of working time reduction older workers
for the benefit of young people returning to the labor market with a view to tutoring and
sharing working time;

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING - p. 29/36

Educate businesses about the need for forward planning functions
critics and skills so that they determine their actual needs and avoid
and to hire overqualified people;
Improve the attractiveness and desirability of certain trades (better working conditions
and / or better remuneration) while developing approaches and amusement
retention across all sectors in order to better understand the expectations of the segments
specific generational and provide them with opportunities matching their expectations;
Attract women and men towards certain sectors "deficit";
Investing in training and development of skills of workers in their
to reconcile production and training needs requirements;
Facilitate lifelong learning and career transition by encouraging
development and reorientation of persons occupying or repetitive posts
overwhelmed to fill the newly created posts;
Integrating the target groups (women, people with disabilities, long term unemployed,
etc.) in enterprises, including creating meeting opportunities between
employers and the target groups (IOD method) 62;
Encourage partnerships with employment services so that they can identify
future needs of businesses in terms of numbers, skills and culture, and so
develop plans to recruit and train people to place when required.

Proposal: Ensure compliance with targets set for training
In Belgium, the interprofessional agreements have defined the following targets: 1.9% of the mass
salary to spend on continuing training for workers; 0.1% of gross wages to be used
for employment and training of groups considered "at risk"; turnout at the
training of 50% of workers. These commitments are unfortunately far from being achieved. To
even contrary: they détricotent over time ... The financial effort is barely 1.1%; rate
Participation in training is in turn 34%. Furthermore, the number of training hours
per participant continues to decline; highly skilled people participate three to four times
more training than the low-skilled; with more than 45 workers
are also discriminated ...
Ecolo believes that an ambitious policy of working and training workers
must be conducted and enforcement mechanisms need to be further enabled for
areas that do not fulfill their obligations.
Ecolo also offers:
to achieve the target of 1.9% in order to fund more training for
less skilled workers, mentoring and companionship measures, training
less formal or informal (conferences, workshops, self-training, supervision,
participation in quality circles ...) and redeploy the paid educational leave ...;
to review the contractual obligations: an addition to contractual obligations
the employer (provide training to its workers) and an addition to the obligations
contractual worker (obligation to follow such training);
to provide a multi-annual forward plan the necessary skills (Outlook
future of the company, orientation training supply ...) for all companies
with a works council;

62

The principle of this method is detailed in the proposal "Facilitating the access of people in precarious employment"
page 13.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING - p. 30/36

to ensure that the continuing education efforts of companies employing at least 50
employees abide by the age of their workers (proration
the number of workers belonging to different age groups) 63.

Proposal: Promote the alternation and multiply the places of stage64
Young people and job seekers who wish must be able to obtain
Qualification via alternating one hand, and achieve a more professional training on the other.
The dual training has weaknesses today: incessant postponement of the commissioning
implementation of the framework cooperation agreement between the Federation Wallonia-Brussels, Wallonia and
2008 Cocof; alternation that is often not really alternation (round trips
between theory and practice are too few established due to the lack of knowledge among world
education and businesses); monitoring or supervision of trainees sometimes insufficient; rate
significant abandonment of certain professions; lack of clarity on the dies (too many)
and methods; Deficiency places stage65 ...
The work and training is covered by the reform of the State, since the learning agreement
Industrial and professional immersion Convention as well as internship and bonus
Start the subject of a transfer to the communities and regions.
Like the Economic and Social Council of Wallonia (CESW), wishes to take advantage of these Ecolo
transfers to aim consistency and finally implement the cooperation agreement which
materialized by the creation of a single status for young people (same rights, same
compensation mechanisms, equal access to certification, regardless of the operator); setting
establishing a single alternation agreement regulating the rights and duties of the parties, accompanied by a
Training plan ; the revision of the system of premiums for employers and operators; creation
a single structure alternating control.
Ecolo also proposes to improve training in alternation:
to work on the simplification of places and devices to reduce the number of dies
that allow to learn the same trade, while ensuring the accessibility of the place of
training by appropriate transport offer or opportunities for decentralization;
to develop maximum synergies between CEFA, IFAPME and schools
social promotion;
to plan the training offer "territory" (catchment area) and articulate action
operators of that territory, taking into account their needs, encouraging them to
enroll in a cooperative logic, pushing them to share equipment ...;
to pay special attention to the training of tutors.
Moreover, Eco believes that any genuine vocational training must be accompanied by a rise
discovery and learning the art (or formulas immersion courses), which is far from
today.
To make the reception of trainees a priority, Ecolo wishes:
maintain and expand in each catchment area, a network of employers ready to welcome
trainees;

63

A bill was filed by Ecolo in the House (53K2551001 proposal).
The Centres of Advanced Technologies (CTA) are part of this logic of alternation providing training
with regard to qualifications of people in the learning process, as did the proposal to support the promotion
social. For details, see Chapter "School" and more specifically the proposal see "Engaging Teaching
calling in Wallonia and Brussels. "
65
The Walloon governments and the Federation Wallonia-Brussels have failed to solve these problems. The energy of
Minister for Employment and Vocational Training focused more on creating other
devices (eg alternation for job seekers).
64

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING - p. 31/36

allow for more immersion courses or in other fields than those
classic business (develop internship offers in the public service, non sector
merchant, competence centers ...);
systematize certain procedures ensuring good quality internship (basic rules,
tutors ...), reflect, with the actors, objectives and courses of calibration (duration ...) and
Register problematic placements in collective labor agreements;
ensure the management of certain costs (travel, medical, insurance ...).

Proposal: Develop mentoring and experiences of companionship
Mentoring in the workplace aims training on the job, by organizing a
learning progress, assessing achievements, communicating the pleasure of a job well
Indeed, transmitting a methodology and rigor and emphasizing the importance of the spirit

Team and mutual assistance. Companion allows direct transmission of knowledge and art,
women and men of business, "the search for the unity of knowledge and know-being,
hand and pensée66 ". Craftsmen, members of the Belgian Union of craftsmen, develop
Also, every day, training via the transmission of specific knowledge and know-how
crafts. This is to train the future architect to complete all aspects of the business that
teaches: create, conceptualize, implement using the traditional methods still in
evolution, install or sell its product. The methods and channels are different from that of the
companionship but are effective to support and protect.
Currently, guardians in Belgium are still too few in number although reductions
quarterly contributions have been increased from 400 euros to 800 euros. Ecolo wishes
therefore encourage direct training to the trade, valuing the experiences of tutoring and
companionship. Some initiatives are certainly initiated but remain for now
insufficient. Additional means to adjust the formulas to field needs, for
sensitize sectors or to allow the tutor to form, must be conferred on those
devices. Ecolo also proposes to set up a tutoring approval procedure
based on a module developed in social promotion.
In parallel, and more generally, Ecolo proposes to gradually deploy the Map
Tandem to all sectors of the merchant and not merchant, and to public services (see
supra).
Proposal: Accelerating skills validation process
The skills validation mechanism was established in 2004 in French-speaking Belgium. It
being, despite the efforts goods (approval of validation centers, gradual implementation of
reference ...), the supply of validation is still largely insufficient.
Ecolo wants the skills validation process deploys quickly for the
right to recognition of the experience of individuals to be effective. By acting on both
the supply of and demand validation validation that the device will become significant. Ecolo
proposes, to that end, to simplify procedures (which today are too heavy), expanding
quickly offering have not yet been affected sectors (other sectors and other levels) and
carry out important actions of communication and a working partnership to encourage
job seekers and workers to resort to the device.

OF CASTERA B., (2012), Companion, Paris, Presses Universitaires de France, ("What do I know?").
Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING - p. 32/36 Proposal: To support the teaching of social promotion and education
Higher extramural
Social advancement education aims to contribute to personal development in
promoting better occupational, social, cultural and academic. He must now
face multiple challenges: it is often in competition with other types of training
rather than complementarity; its public funding is insufficient ...
For Ecolo, social advancement education must be consolidated for several reasons: it is
as teaching training; it brews very diverse populations; he organized a
from secondary to higher education and enables vertical mobility and mobility
horizontal with great flexibility, both in training and in the content
partnerships; it is part of public service supply and, as such, certify, validate and values
gained experience.
Ecolo offers include:
to guarantee the autonomy of the organizers Powers while encouraging them to develop
concerted practices and partnership in their catchment area;
guarantee access to social advancement education to everyone, and maintain
free for job seekers;
allow additional funding when it comes to meeting needs
new (eg critical functions, green industries ...) and to provide means to
and the validation of acquired skills;
enhance the educational environment in the promotion of educational institutions
social to accompany people increasingly fragile;
to relax the conditions of recruitment experts and offer them training
short teaching;
develop teaching evening courses at universities and colleges
to form while exercising a professional activity. This teaching
can play a key role in obtaining a first higher education diploma
as part of a professional reorientation.
Proposal: Redeploy the paid educational leave
The educational leave allows the private sector to be absent from work without
losing their pay (at least up to a ceiling) for training of their choice. There
training followed need not be related to the function or serve in the company: the
paid educational leave is primarily a promotional device and personal emancipation. This is
also a shared device intelligently: all companies pay into a fund that
indemnifies hindsight, companies have "lost" working hours due to holidays
granted to training their staff. The federal government also contributes to device ... or
contributed. For the paid educational leave will soon be transferred to the Regions "which will
concluded a cooperation agreement with the Communities for the organization of training. "
The regionalization of the device may not lead - as some would - to
reorient the device on sectoral formations directly to the utilities market
work or business organization. Instead, Ecolo wants the Regions
safeguard the same principle underlying the paid educational leave, ie the individual right to
training (general or vocational training, such social advancement education,
formations of the middle classes, the university-type training ... or similar).
Ecolo therefore wishes:
raise the ceiling of hours that workers are entitled;
Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter EMPLOYMENT AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING - p. 33/36 better define the nature of accepted training, promote access to training
Terms and cultural and reject sectoral formations of this device;
permit or facilitate access of all private sector workers to educational leave
pay: part-time workers, flexible hours, small and medium enterprises ...

SOCIAL ECONOMY AND COOPERATIVE
An inclusive and innovative economy
Status and political horizon
State of play
The social economy, through the men and women who wear it, did not wait for the crisis
economic and financial to imagine economic alternatives that respect rights and
of the environment. Its companies have turned to the realization of a social purpose rather than
profit maximization, valuing the worker before the shareholder, while trying to ensure
minimum profitability for their business.
Social profit companies are developing projects that combine economic dimension
involving the production of goods and / or services and include a social dimension embodied
with a goal of service to the community and a democratic management style.
Far from being anecdotal, the social economy is continuing to grow in spite of the crisis. In
2011 French-speaking Belgium, it brings together nearly 9000 companies for 154,138 jobs
108,851 full-time equivalents (FTE). The share in the overall economy is 7 to 8%. By
Moreover, these companies show they are fairly resistant to their own growth cycle and
are durable players in the local economy because 80% of them have more
five years1. Social economy entrepreneurs are active in many
sectors such as waste recovery, the catering industry, tourism, agriculture and agribusiness,
health, community services, training and professional integration, new
technologies, fair trade, renewable energy, culture, sport ...
And all these initiatives may take different legal forms: Associations aimlessly
profit (NPO), cooperatives, mutual or social purpose companies.
These figures show how the essential features of the social economy are
as many levers to the ecological transition of the economy (see below). The social economy is
consists of a multitude of small economic structures that allow it to be really
rooted in the territory in which it develops. This very dense network of companies allows
local and regional territories to benefit from a human and social dynamics while
guaranteeing a significant source of jobs can not be relocated. Social profit companies
working towards the empowerment and emancipation of beneficiaries, by inserting them into society,
reinforcing their independence (through education, culture, health care, etc.) and supporting their
participation in social life. Far from being a mere consumer, the beneficiary is considered
acting as a citizen of his career.
Another distinctive feature of the social economy, it is more resistant to disturbances and shocks
economic and financial. Indeed, actors are not mobilized by the exclusive logic
financial gain and potentially unnecessary risks that can induce.

Observatory of Social Economy, "The social economy is revealed," Notebooks of the Observatory, in December 2011.
Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter SOCIAL ECONOMY AND COOPERATIVE - p 1/11 The Ecolo political horizon for the social economy
The economic alternatives shaped daily by social entrepreneurs and the economy
Social demonstrate that there is already another meaningful economy. In this sense, it is
Ecolo important to promote the social economy, not as a poultice to wounds
economic liberalism, but as real economic alternative whose vocation is
universalize its contributions to the rest of the economy. This new conception of the purpose of
the economy, which aims to integrate the long-term, rational altruism and produce profits
social and environmental beyond the scope of workers, officers and shareholders
to focus on the present and future community stationed outside the usual field of economy
social, is notably illustrated by the recent concept positive2 economy. Ecolo wants to recognize
the social economy identity and rightful place in our society and in our politics
economic. As social enterprises, like other businesses, are subject
to market imperatives, competition and the difficulties of financing and trésorerie3. They
should at least have the same support as the classic entrepreneurial world and,
regard to their social utility, be properly taken into account by the authorities.
Indeed, at present, the social economy is at best ignored or diluted in
fashionable concepts as "social entrepreneurship" or "corporate social responsibility
businesses. " That is why it is important to recognize the social economy as a first
essential component of a pluralist economy actress full redeployment of our share
economic. At a time of post-austerity, it will be important as the human environment
again become the engines of our economy, and only those who pay the price of always
more growth.
The social economy is a living reality which is a key innovation laboratory
sociale4, essential to the ecological transition of the economy, and more broadly in society. The
system as it currently operates does not allow social innovation to establish itself as
the obvious way. It is therefore, small steps small steps but with determination, open society
the social economy. Allowing, for example, these companies have better access to
public, to have better access to regional economic redeployment tools markets. he
is also important that public authorities support creativity and social innovation
as they carry more obviously social value but also environmental,
and they carry economic activities and thus employment.
Recognizing the many positive externalities generated by the social economy for
société5 and considering guarantees of governance and reinvestment of profits,
Taxation has to play a role in strengthening and especially not penalize these actors
the social economy that put their time and money at the service of the "wellness" and struggling
against this model of exhaustion that is currently ours.
The main points of the Ecolo project for the social economy
The ecological transition of the economy can not be achieved without a common effort to
ensure the economic conversion and therefore without promoting the development of an economy
plural. It is necessary that the social economy is recognized as an essential pillar of the
transition.

See the report of Jacques Attali the President of the French Republic on the positive economy. According to the report,
positive economics is already present so localized in the social economy, in responsibility
social enterprise and social entrepreneurship. "It aims to allow everyone to give a clear answer to the
question that may arise after a day's work: I am useful to society, today and tomorrow? What estce I contribute? My work does make sense? Do I participate in the construction or rather the destruction of
world of tomorrow? ".

Constituting an alternative to unemployment strike more public budgets, providing psychosocial benefits but also health workers, providing many services to the community including in
not operated by the traditional economy sectors, ensuring a multitude of environmental benefits, etc.
Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter SOCIAL ECONOMY AND COOPERATIVE - p 2/11 A society committed to the welfare and prosperity of its citizens goes hand in hand with the
development of personal services, local dynamics and short circuits,
renewable energies ... are all areas where the social economy is positioned as
pioneering.
Faced with the opportunities that brings the social economy sector is deeply Ecolo
convinced of the central role of government in society's support on the way
transition and redeployment towards sustainable production system and reducing
inequality.
For Ecolo, so it is urgent to act in particular by responding to these three priorities:
Further open the economy to practices and social economy enterprises
Strengthen support for the cooperative and social economy
Strengthen and ensure the recognition of the social economy within an economy
plural
Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: MORE OPEN ECONOMY AND PRACTICES
SOCIAL ECONOMY COMPANIES
It is important for Ecolo that governments actively encourage the participation of
social economy enterprises in economic life by considering them as actors pleindroit and allowing them to have access to equal opportunities in public procurement or to
employment-environment alliances. It is thus important to ensure the Ecolo has smoothly
operation of a European, federal and regional legislative framework conducive to economic diversity
and social innovation.
Proposal: Adopt regulations on state aid
timely for social economy enterprises
Just recently, the European Commission has reformed aid regulatory package
public. This is obviously a fundamental challenge for the actors of the social economy that are
beneficiaries of public aid in Belgium. This reform consists of four documents
legislation which notably affect the exemption from notification of aid granted to undertakings
providing a general economic interest (SGEI) 6. This concept comes from an entitlement
European and allows a public authority to financially reward a company that
makes a service that is not offered as such by the market and which has a public utility. This
concept thus covers a wide range of services, but without giving an exhaustive list:
energy supply, distribution and treatment of water, integration enterprises, transport,
social housing, facilities for the elderly and disabled, kindergartens, theaters ...
The public authority will then ask (via public procurement, public service delegations
or subsidies) to one or more companies to provide these services and to grant
businesses in return for financial compensation of public service.
6
An SGEI is defined as "a merchant service activity fulfilling missions of general interest and subject of this
made by Member States to specific obligations of public service. It thus plays a vital role in cohesion
social and territorial cohesion and is a local service therefore do not jeopardize competition between states. It is therefore
Ecolo obvious to the missions of general interest should take precedence over the competition.
Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter SOCIAL ECONOMY AND COOPERATIVE - p 3/11 The existence of notification exemption conditions is essential because it significantly reduces
administrative burdens by exempting the Member State to follow the notification procedure
prior and, in addition, allows the public authorities to put in place to support
development of certain services of general interest without such aid to be accused of
distort competition.
Furthermore, the possibility of organizing proxying a social enterprise for
provision of an SGEI is also provided by the Almunia7 package.
For Ecolo, the notion of SGEI must be clarified because its current definition could be used to
detriment of the players in the social economy if its interpretation is too restrictive.
Proposal: Ensure access of social economy enterprises to markets
Public
As for small and medium enterprises, public procurement is a source
significant income for social enterprises as they represent at
European no less than 1800 billion, or 16% of gross domestic product européen8. It is
therefore necessary for Ecolo, simplify access to these via public procurement reform
European and national regulations in this area.
In addition to measures already formulées9, Ecolo offers:
Strengthen social and environmental clauses in public procurement. At
European, a proposal is being negotiated on the allocation of
concession contracts. Ecolo defends a perspective that aims to empower business
buyers and not to make the ultimate economic efficiency and single criterion. For
Ecolo, it should promote the integration of social clauses stimulating social and professional integration so that social enterprises can conclude
partnerships or outsourcing contracts with "traditional" companies. It is
important that public procurement pursue educational goals or insertion
unemployed or low education aged 50 or more apprentices, trainees
or learners. A similar approach should be carried out in the area
Environmental to take into account the ethical standards and "green" which, more
specifically, the costs of life cycles of products;
Furthermore, to allow all enterprises, including social economy,
to respond to tenders, Ecolo intends to limit the use of criteria
turnover in the tendering and to promote the division into smaller lots for
a very small business, a social enterprise, can seize more
easy part of the project;
In addition, integration in the short lists of a social enterprise should be
proposed as much as possible to enable social economy enterprises to
position in smaller markets, those concerned with the negotiated procedure without
publicity ;
Finally, the facilitator functions / coordinator for social clauses that ensure
the interface between contracting authorities and social economy enterprises should be
perpetuated.

The "Almunia Package", named Vice-President of the European Commission responsible for competition, is the name
given to the consolidation of EU measures relating to services of general economic interest (SGEI).

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter SOCIAL ECONOMY AND COOPERATIVE - p 4/11 Proposal: To ensure the participation of social economy enterprises
economic redeployment
In the regions, the principle of Employment-Environment Alliance (EEA) has proposed a new
dynamics of governance, in that it aims to mobilize and coordinate public,
private (including the social economy) and associations around concerted actions between them. The project is
truly innovative because it is not only consultation and participation, but classic
closely involved from the outset all stakeholders to achieve a genuine
collective and individual commitment to work together to achieve objectives
shared, namely the development of green and social sectors and the creation of sustainable jobs.
In this context, Ecolo supports the creation of joint enterprises clusters of economy

social and traditional in future EEA. These clusters are mainly active for now
in the middle of green building. They bring together social economy enterprises,
companies of classical economics, craftsmen, architects ... They are a
unique opportunity for those economic actors to work together, to stimulate, to
strengthen and thus increase their economic and commercial potential. These clusters are
also an excellent way to work on a different vision of the economy and local employment.

PRIORITY 2: SUPPORT FOR STRENGTHENING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COOPERATIVE
The Federal Government still has in his hands various levers it can use to promote
the development of the social economy and, primarily, that of taxation. The latter
must not penalize but rather encourage economic actors who decide to embark on this
type of business that puts the people and the environment at its center.
To do this, Ecolo offers:
to significantly increase the amount of tax-exempt dividend companies
approved for cooperatives and companies with a social purpose in the amount of € 350 (against a
current ceiling placed € 180);
remove for companies that pursue a social purpose useful targets
the whole of society the imposition of the amounts allocated to achieving that objective.
The relevant objectives are helping people, renovation of sites of activity
disused economics, environmental protection, protection and conservation
nature, acquisition, construction, renovation, sale or rental
social housing, aid to developing countries, energy production
durable, training;
tax support can also help recovery of a distressed company or
end of activity by its workers as coopérative10.
Furthermore, Ecolo will ensure that a more comprehensive reflection be launched to highlight the
adequate mechanisms to secure investors mainly in case of bankruptcy of
company.

Proposal: To support social economy initiatives
It is essential for Ecolo allow each and everyone to engage in the creation of a
social enterprise to restore meaning to the economic system. This support
unfailing creativity and innovation is also justified by the importance of creating
value and employment they generate, especially in a context of crisis.

10

See Chapter "Independents and SMEs".

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter SOCIAL ECONOMY AND COOPERATIVE - p 5/11

But the social economy still suffers from a certain lack of image that intends to confine
this economic fringe to a type of sponsored and non-viable economy. Taking into account
social and environmental goals is not and should not be a hindrance to creativity and
innovation.
Therefore Ecolo intends, firstly, encourage the creation of social enterprises and,
secondly, to encourage all initiatives that tend to publicize and promote this type
indispensable to our vision of economic redeployment company.
Thus, Ecolo offers:
to support the social economy in consulting agencies. They constitute, in effect, one of
regional policy levers to boost social enterprises. They
have as main objectives advise and support business creation and
more generally to support project developers in their launch process
activity. Despite the differences in legislation in Wallonia and in the Brussels Region,
important to ensure that these agencies do not focus their work on creating
Business as accompaniment, especially in times of crisis, support becomes more
increasingly essential for social entrepreneurs. Moreover, these consulting agencies
should not participate in an overly restrictive view of the social economy by focusing
only on the "merchant" pane. But more fundamentally, it is important
Ecolo to ensure sufficient and stable funding of these structures. Indeed,
Currently, these agencies are underfunded and themselves obliged to
their survival, to charge a portion of their accompanying hours or
draw in other envelopes already assigned to "projects". In a period of
crisis where it is important to put people at the center of economic development, it is
unthinkable not to provide sufficient resources to these structures;
strengthen the starting aid, particularly for the financial aspect, which remains a
as need for SMEs and the self in general. The public sector needs
be able to recognize the creativity and innovation where they are and give
a useful boost when needed. There, at the regional level, two
sources of funding for social economy enterprises: Brusoc in Region
Brussels and Wallonia SOWECSOM. Ecolo wants to guarantee these tools
resources needed to effectively support the actors in the social economy. Indeed,
each creating a social economy structure are born good jobs
and stable economic development and meaningful;
sustainability beyond the legislature and the widespread support initiatives
(also grant requests) to the social economy such as scholarship
ImpulCera launch to launch a social enterprise or after
evaluation and adaptation if necessary, calls to business'S project aimed at
Consulting agencies.

PRIORITY 3: BUILDING AND ENSURING A STRONG IDENTITY OF ECONOMY
SOCIAL

Proposal: Ensure representation of the social economy at both
national and European level
The last reform of the state has led to a series of transfers of powers including those of
many levers of development of the social economy. However, further levers
development of the social economy at the federal level. Therefore, it is important for Ecolo
maintain a place of dialogue where all stakeholders in the social economy
can meet and work together on actions.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter SOCIAL ECONOMY AND COOPERATIVE - p 6/11

That is why, in agreement with the requests made by the representative federations
the social economy, Ecolo intends to ensure:
the establishment of a consultation Interfederal to bring together regional actors and
Federal social economy around the same table. This body would be placed under the
Head of SPP "social integration" and would aim to ensure coordination between
the different levels of power and above all to ensure monitoring and consistency
federal measures that may directly or indirectly impact the sector
the social economy as tax changes or in terms of status of companies;
creating a Interfederal Council of Social Economy that would have as its main
function of monitoring the work of the meeting interface and permanence
a place for exchange of information between the different stakeholders and different
pouvoir11 levels.
On the European scene, the newly elected parliamentarians have the opportunity to create
intergroup which are informal forums encounter. They aim to bring together
elected officials, whatever their nationality and political affiliation, around thematic issues.
Today, there is a "social economy" intergroup including three Green deputies belong. He has
intended to promote the views on policies and legislation that directly affect
or indirectly to the social economy sector, to create a space for regular dialogue between
MEPs, national experts, interest groups and associations
engaged in promoting the social economy. Ecolo proposes to maintain this intergroup
"Social economy" beyond 2014. This is indeed an important point of entry for dialogue
between European politicians and industry stakeholders to ensure the interests of
the social economy in EU legislation.

Proposal: Recognize the stronghold of the social economy in a
plural economy
Although benefiting from legal texts that define and recognize the social economy barely
sometimes to his place alongside other economic actors.
It is true that the forms can take these social economy enterprises are diverse,
it is not always possible to identify the specific features of each structure. It is most
coexistence of social economy structures that participate in economic activities and other
participating in the performance of services to the population, training, integration.
Through these action diversities, all the actors of the social economy are characterized by
purpose of service to the community or its members by autonomous management by a
process of democratic decision-making and the primacy of people and work on the
capital in the distribution of wealth.
It is, firstly, a need to improve the legal status of cooperatives in order to guarantee
most eager to be part of the social economy enterprises the existence of a legal framework for their
to stand vis-à-vis the public authorities, workers and customers. Indeed,
Currently, the cooperative society is a form of commercial company with as
feature a minimum of three partners, a variable capital and freedom
statutory. A cooperative society is also characterized by a deliberately limited to return
profit cooperators, profits being reinvested into the activity. It is for this reason
this form has been a great success, including those who were not particularly
animated by the spirit of cooperation.
On the other hand, support the emergence of a common framework for mutual societies and associations
should also be supported.

11

The signing of a cooperation agreement between the federated entities and the federal level is the necessary prerequisite to the
establishment of a consultation Interfederal and its institutionalization.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter SOCIAL ECONOMY AND COOPERATIVE - p 7/11

Create a new statute for cooperative societies of the social economy
The creation of a new legal form for cooperative societies is therefore a
qu'Ecolo intends to use policy levers to strengthen both the identity of the social economy
in the national and European economic development.
To do this, Ecolo wants:
Create a specific legal framework for cooperative societies which meet the
specificities of the social economy in value. The cooperative principles are well registered
in the Companies Code;
Start a similar approach to reform at European level about the status of the
European cooperative society, while preserving the diversity of forms of entrepreneurship
in Europe.
Furthermore, Ecolo proposes to create a new supplementary status for cooperatives
basis of workers' production cooperative societies as they exist in France. It's about
SC type of business enterprise or SCRL whose employees are associated with majority
capital, enabling them to exercise their profession there together, develop their working tool
their expertise sharing risks, profits, decisions. This is, inter alia, on the basis
of this new status, firstly, to encourage the transfer of healthy businesses to workers
especially when we know that the transmission problem will concern nearly 30,000
companies per year by 2020 and, secondly, to encourage, where possible, the recovery
firms in difficulty by workers.
Transversely, it is essential to provide financial and human resources to fill in
National Co-operation Council (CNC) so that it can effectively fulfill its mission
Promoting the social economy and of organizations that make it live.
Adopting a European statute for mutual societies and associations
It is also important for Ecolo defend a real European statute for mutual societies and
associations to establish a secure regulatory framework for these companies
the social economy. This European framework is also important to encourage the creation and
strengthening of European dynamics between associations and mutuals from
different Member States of the Union.
Regarding the status of European association, it is essential to push the Commission to
present a proposal to allow the Belgian associations to give a dimension
European in their organization and to their activities. In this context, proposes setting Ecolo
a European statute for associations, accompanied by a process of "labeling"
associations meet certain criteria and wish to engage in civil dialogue.
This is for Ecolo and lay the foundation stone of a new stage for a renewal of
European democracy through more participatory processes;
The same reasoning must be for mutuals. The establishment of a European statute
for mutual help to disseminate the principles of solidarity and democracy as
foundations of an economic model and increased resistance markets
Insurance deal with crises12.

Defending a rigorous definition of the social economy based on its four pillars
Fundamental
Ecolo welcomes the adoption in 2011 of the European initiative for entrepreneurship but social13
interrogates the meaning EU this term "social entrepreneurship". The
identity problem of the sector is all the more noticeable.
Indeed, at European level, an Anglo-Saxon concept of "social entrepreneurship" has
tend to prevail, which is much broader than the approach of such social economy
as defended by Ecolo. The European approach includes voluntary activism, partnerships
public-private with a social purpose, individual initiatives and for some, initiatives
gathered under the term "Corporate Social Responsibility" (CSR). The Anglo-Saxon influences also attracts a more individualistic vision disagree with the vision more
systemic (or collective) specific to the social economy.
As part of this initiative and resulting actions, Ecolo has to defend a
definition of the social economy based on four fundamental pillars:
the purpose of service to the community or the members rather than the profit purpose;
management autonomy;
democratic decision-making process;
the primacy of people and work over capital in the distribution of income.

Proposal: Ensure proper implementation of the decree ICSE not unravel
the employability sector
Training Companies by work (LFS) and the Professional Insertion agencies
(OISP) depend on the Decree of 1 April 2004 on the approval and subsidization of EFT
and OISP. Each of these structures continues precious following objectives: to allow all
beneficiary to develop its capacity to form by helping him learn behaviors
professional and technical skills to access to skills training
and, ultimately, to the labor market; bring it to define a career plan, including a
vocational training project; bring to a skills assessment and become actor
their professional project and mend social ties; bring it to develop autonomy
social.
Given the economic situation and policy developments, this sector has experienced
many changes both in its subsidization that in his teaching or his
public. A new decree would then be created to reflect its evolution and live with
his time. This is the ICSE decree adopted in 2013.
Given the importance of the sector in terms of employment and the importance of the social objective
pursued by the EFT and OISP in times of economic and social crises, ensure Ecolo,
in close collaboration with the sector, that adverse effects do not emerge
in the application of certain decree of points including:
The potential for these structures to welcome, through a waiver system, youth
already have an upper secondary qualification. Ecolo will be particularly
vigilant that this possibility for structures do not make detriment of
the weakest people who are the heart of public EFT / OISP;
The respect for a true partnership between the FOREM and balanced operators
training ;

13
This European initiative aims to focus the actions of the European Union on three areas: improving
access to finance for social enterprises, improving the visibility of these economic actors, and finally,
improving the legal environment for stability and clarity.

RESEARCH AND INNOVATION
A research for generations
current and future
Status and political horizon
State of play
Western societies are plagued by various societal challenges such as aging
population, the fight against climate change, increasing poverty, even endemic,
etc. Some of them are specifically induced by globalization that has not dampened
its course despite the economic and financial crisis.
Research, development and innovation policy can provide solutions to meet
these challenges and improve the prospects of people when a set of framework conditions
are presented.
In Belgium, we can count on many researchers whose projects are large
quality and provide ways to ensure the ecological transition of our societies and improve
our well-being.
Given the diversity of possible technological trajectories, the state must organize the debate
Democratic taking into account their relevance to a transition goal just
our societies.
Some technological options must be abandoned or postponed, pursuant
the principles of prudence and caution. Others must be strengthened when
enable women and men to live better, longer lasting, and more peacefully
Longer.
The relative performance of the Belgian economy and the risk of hyper concentration of
R & D & I
CIS1 the latest survey shows that the number of Belgian companies who report having performed a
Product innovation is slightly above the average for the EU15. They seem, however,
be less effective in converting these products into commercial successes. The percentage of the volume
sales generated through the sale of new or improved products is lower than in Belgium to
average EU-15. The number of companies that innovate their production processes was
18% lower than the three neighboring countries (Germany, France, Netherlands). To do
facing the increasing competition in export markets, product innovation, which
generates higher quality of goods and / or a more comprehensive range and conquer new
markets are a major asset.
As in most countries, private spending on R & D in Belgium are widely
concentrated in large companies, the 10 most active companies in this field

1
The Community Innovation Survey, or CIS (from the English Community innovation survey), is conducted in all
EU Member States to collect data on innovation activities in companies, that is to say on
innovation of products (goods and services) and process innovation (organizational or commercial).

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter RESEARCH AND INNOVATION - p 1/17

representing over a third of R & D efforts. Belgian situation is however characterized by the fact
that are mainly subsidiaries of foreign companies. This situation increases the vulnerability of
our country in the era of globalization which also has the effect of increasing mobility
R & D activities. In addition, over 70% of patent applications are filed in Belgium
by foreign companies.
The few very large companies (over 1000 employees) represent a majority of
R & D in 2007, or 54% and less than 150 workers represent only
1/3 of R & D expenditure.
Finally, the concentration of R & D & I sector is: in Wallonia, the share of the pharmacy in
Indeed, quadrupled in 15 years while those of other industries (manufacturing and equipment
Electrical or Chemical) was divided by 2, and R & D
in metallurgy was reduced to the bare minimum. This lack of diversification
problematic because it means that R & D Walloon - and, in its wake, the entire fabric
economic - depends on a handful of large pharmaceutical companies.
Measures to diversify our economic base and make it more resistant to potential
shocks are developed in the chapters "ecological transition" and "Independent and SMEs".
The knowledge society is not about money or technology
Under a European agreement of 2000, renewed in 2010, member states committed themselves to
spend 3% of their GDP on research and development, two thirds of the effort is provided by the
private sector. However, it is clear that progress has been limited in this area. This
delay is of particular concern because it poses a risk to our jobs, especially
those who are subject to international competition. Indeed, during the last decade,
R & D intensity (R & D expenditures on GDP) of China (excluding Hong Kong) has
increased by about 55% between 2001 and 2008, from 0.95% to 1.47% (against 1.97% in
Belgium in 2008). In 2011, the figures were 2.07% for Belgium against just under
2% for China. The result is that our lead is reduced in terms of technology,
productivity and knowledge. To achieve the objective, average annual growth rate of
R & D expenditure should be more than 4 times the average annual economic growth expected
for those years.
Regionally, it appears that the Brussels-Capital Region spent 1.5% of its GDP on
R & D 2.2% against 2.3% in Flanders and in Wallonia (2009). The Brussels underinvestment
are mainly due to the weakness of private sector investment that is not free
related to the narrowness of the territory of the Region and the relative absence of high industrial fabric
technology or medium-high Technology2.
This bleak picture should not however mask the fact that, despite the crisis,
funding of basic research, which is decisive, has been preserved Federation
Wallonia-Brussels (FNRS including sustainability) and that, in this respect, the FWB audessus rest of the EU average. Between 2007 (before the crisis) and 2009 (peak of the crisis), the
Brussels-Capital Region, meanwhile, increased budget allocations for R & D by 36%, the
Walloon region of 27%, the French Community of 13% and 19% of Flanders 3.
The use of English - universally accepted as the language in all sciences
worldwide - must be prioritized at all stages of the career of a researcher and, as
in the natural sciences than in the humanities and social sciences. Relatively
weak results in Wallonia and Brussels researchers in obtaining scholarships
the European Research Council (ERC) and the very low rate of participation of researchers
Humanities and Social Sciences Federation Wallonia-Brussels calls for ERC projects serve
revealing in this regard.

To remedy this, ensuring the visibility of international scientists
social and human (which employ significantly less frequently in English) but also attract
more foreign researchers, it is essential to promote academic English in
Doctoral schools and offer these courses not only for doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows, but also to any researcher, regardless of the stage of his career.
Increase the budget for R & D is not a guarantee of success. There is no univocal relation
between spending on R & D and economic success such as growth or profitability. The
cooperative models are, against a success factor (Boaz, Allen, Hamilton, Money is not
everything, 2005). Thus, beyond the internal sources, innovation also requires interaction
ever greater with external knowledge sources. Thus, customers and suppliers
may also have useful information. But we also see that the institutions of
knowledge gaining importance.
However, for a company to exploit external knowledge, it must have
a certain absorption capacity.
In terms of number of new registration of trade marks and designs / models percentage
GDP, the results of Belgium are comparable to the average of the EU-15 regarding the

brands and slightly lower for drawings / models. For both indicators, Belgium
However, is in the lower half of the ranking of countries in the EU-15.

The political horizon Ecolo in research, development and
innovation
For Ecolo, a policy of research and innovation must be built around five principles:
1. An increased quality of life, promoting social and environmental well-being. It is
focus on fundamental or applied research projects that fit into this goal.
Thus, research on military weapons in particular should not be
recorded in the volume of investment in each country.
2. Sustainable financing: improving opportunities for project financing
research and innovation geared towards the long term. A financing guarantee for a
relatively long period (4-5 years) is essential for a quality of work,
independence and integrity of researchers and scholars. The political and scientific time
different. The succession of fixed-term contracts is often very difficult to live for
researchers. In addition, it is usually against-productive given the human investment and
material needed to form a scientific and to implement its environment
research. We must develop transition mechanisms between precarious status and status
sustainable, particularly when research unit manages to build a specific competence.
3. Proven ethics: the ethical aspects of research must be explicitly
examined in the appropriate democratic fora (eg nanotechnology).
4. enhanced cooperation: favoring cooperation between laboratories, universities and centers
Belgian research, European and from developing countries. Cooperation shall
by more innovation opportunities, a significant increase in the intrinsic quality
publications and the results of research, and a more equitable sharing of benefits
economic potential (patents, licenses ...). A partnership of cooperation policies
development and research policy is also to strengthen to increase the transfer
knowledge and allow for cooperative policies based on the latest
scientific developments. As Flanders has for many years,
French and German-speaking communities must invest much more in materials and
scientific and technical structures of UNESCO spring.
5. Transparent publication: to increase access to scientific journals, including
acting on cost or using the potential of Internet broadcasting and facilitate
publication of interdisciplinary work.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter RESEARCH AND INNOVATION - p 3/17

Research is one of the most fragmented skills in Belgium. The Communities and Regions
but have large federal level skills also funds programs
specific and strategic research at national and international levels. Contacts
multiple, special interests, limited powers, regionalism and sub-divisions do not favor
not the emergence of a common project. It is also for Ecolo ensure consistency
projects and effective coordination between the projects of each other.
A knowledge society
Besides technological innovation, the non-technological aspects, such as design or
process, also play an important role. In Belgium, the percentage of companies that have
process for marketing innovations is lower than that recorded in neighboring countries. This has
particularly been the case in patent applications at the European Patent Office.
If Belgium wants to succeed the necessary transition to a creative economy, it must
also strengthen the effort of non-technological innovation. Creative industries, for
such as architecture, fashion, audiovisual, music and communication, can
play an important role in the matter. The challenge is therefore to move towards an economy
creative by enhancing the role of cultural and creative industries as catalysts
innovation and structural change. However, it is important that this support activities
Creative occurs naturally and not be manipulated for this sole FIN4.
Social innovation - which is not unique to the humanities - also has a role in
Most important to play in regional development. To meet the societal challenges we
we need to find new ideas that both the social needs
and create sustainable solutions, job opportunities and new markets. We
We need changes that improve the well-being of our society while enabling
meet the economic challenges and respecting the environment.
The EU has made social innovation one of the cornerstones of the new Europe 2020 Strategy,
for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.
Thus, social innovation is characterized by its innovative and unconventional and goal
General pursued is to say that to enhance the well-being of individuals and communities.
It is equally characterized by an implementation process involving cooperation
between a diversity of actors from the results, tangible or intangible. Longer
term, innovations can have a social effectiveness that goes beyond the initial project and
represent a challenge that questions the major societal equilibrium. They then become sources
social transformations and can contribute to the emergence of a new model
development.
An integrated research policy
The policy of research and innovation can not be conceived in isolation as it is closely
related to basic research and teaching: it is, in fact, produce the
basic knowledge, absorb and convert them into useful new products and processes
to society; or entrepreneurship. And this, especially when it comes to aligning
R & D expenditure with the objectives of the green transition in so far as it appears that the
Larger companies spend relatively higher amounts in R & D verte5.

The main points of the draft Ecolo
To develop a policy on research, innovation and development actually
inclusive and serving the society, Ecolo calls for the following priorities:

Provide researchers with optimal working conditions
Research as a vector of the ecological transition
Focus on science and social innovation
Research at the service of society

Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: RESEARCHERS PROVIDE OPTIMUM WORKING CONDITIONS
Proposal: To harmonize and strengthen the status of the researcher
According to their sources of funding (SNSF, funds associated FNRS such as FRIA, special funds
research, concerted research action, foundations or other), researchers have
a different status which results, inter alia, at their monetary conditions,
their tax status, their research calendar, fringe benefits they receive,
etc.
To address this situation, a source of unequal treatment and complexity, offers ECOLO
to define by decree a status of researchers from above by harmonizing and ensuring the portability
social rights between the academic world and other sectors employing researchers.

Proposal: Fund more permanent researchers
It is important to provide sustainable funding opportunities for researchers. The stable positions
(academic or permanent researchers) are rare. The succession of fixed-term contracts
unsecured financing to several years is not only difficult to live for
Researchers who find themselves in precarious status, but this discontinuity is also cons-productive
given the necessary material and human investment to form a scientific and
set up its research environment.
Ecolo will therefore aim for a significant percentage of perpetuated researchers, all disciplines
confused in basic research, including creating more jobs
permanent FNRS. These additional posts will open career opportunities
(other than purely academic) researchers, to encourage young people to embark on a
scientific career, and fight against the brain drain. Qualified researchers
unevenly distributed between academic institutions. The allocation of new mandates will
be on an objective basis considering research potential of each
university. In addition, a periodic evaluation procedure must be established to ensure
a balance between the stability of the status of trained researcher and obligations
research activities that permanent researchers must ensure throughout their
career.

Proposal: Increase the number of women who make a career in science
(including academic)
The metaphor of the "leaky pipeline" and that of the "glass ceiling" is still valid,
especially in universities. Indeed, only 10% of full professors are women
and the proportion of women and their share of FTEs decreases gradually as we climbed the
levels of academic careers. Reach professor is harder

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter RESEARCH AND INNOVATION - p 5/17

for women than for men.6. Women face multiple barriers that are
observed throughout their careers and jeopardize their chances of reaching the levels
highest in the academic hierarchy (weight of male model on the dominant design
academic career, criteria and appointment and promotion procedures, composition
appointments commission imposed international mobility, etc.).
Ecolo proposes to provide practical solutions to apprehend the tools to
reduce the distortion. This notably through the adoption of an action plan for equality
Within each university, promoting research and gender studies, creation
institutes which regroup, within universities, the teams working on gender order
encourage multidisciplinary collaboration, to provide these funds to encourage institutes
multidisciplinary research on gender.

Proposal: Reduce response time to better motivate and submitted projects
decisions
For some selection procedures (including within the FNRS), response times are
particularly long, up to 5 or 6 months between submission of the project and the announcement of
selection result. It is obvious that such delays are difficult to live and for candidate
candidates waiting for a response and possible funding for the months and years ahead.
These delays could be reduced without undermine the rigor of the evaluations. In addition, as
it is now the case in FNRS, decisions made by selection bodies deserve to be
strongly motivated and must be transmitted to researchers, especially in cases
refusal. Ecolo also proposes that each project be submitted to an evaluation sheet
transmitted to the project promoter.
The composition of the scientific committees of the SNSF must also reflect the landscape of
university education by counting professors and researchers from each university.

Proposal: To support doctoral students
In academia, many doctoral candidates are left to themselves and conditions
work are not favorable. It is important to have all the data to analyze it
phenomenon and to implement policies that medium-term objective will be to increase
the number of doctoral students who become doctors. At the same time, intends to remove the Ecolo
criterion of maximum five years after graduation to qualify for a postdoctoral fellowship
FNRS. During the 2009-2014 term, this criterion has already been deleted for
doctoral fellowships.

Proposal: Unify and expand the Walloon research administration and
harmonize procedures
Wallonia has several counters to fund research and innovation:
the administration in charge of research at the Walloon Public Service is empowered to finance
Research in all areas, but some other departments of the Walloon administration
also manage budgets "research", namely the administrations in charge of energy,
the environment, land use, agriculture and structural funds.
The procedures may differ profoundly from a window to another. The stack of devices
brings candidates to projects or research mandates to increase the duty applications in
to integrate them in procedures, canvas and various forms of a case to another.
The exploded research management in Wallonia also corollary an increased risk of

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter RESEARCH AND INNOVATION - p 6/17

double funding. For the sake of simplification and optimum use of energy, the objective
must be to achieve that projects are examined only once - with all the independence
and the required scientific rigor - and directed to the most appropriate mechanism corresponding to the
quality and nature of the project. The harmonization of procedures and improving their fluidity and
their reactivity is another objective to serve both operators and agents
administrative. In this regard, the approach which began in Brussels to set up a base
data from all regional grantees businesses so they should not
send the same documents several times and they can not benefit from two
subsidy, should be continued.
While ensuring the financing of various areas currently supported, different
Walloon types of funding for R & D & I will be grouped within the same department
burden of financing applied research in Wallonia, technological or nontechnologique, including social innovation and funded research and innovation projects
thanks to European structural funds.

Proposal: Strengthen collaborations between federal entities
Ecolo proposes to strengthen the partnership between the Federation Wallonia-Brussels, Wallonia and
Brussels-Capital Region and, to the extent possible, with the Flemish Community,
through a strengthening of joint action plans between entities responsible for research.
This would achieve critical mass in certain areas, promote
Collaboration between researchers and maximize the impact of budgets for
research and knowledge mobilization.
Furthermore, Ecolo supports the idea of ​​sharing best practices among federal entities,
each can learn from mutual experiences and practices.

PRIORITY 2: RESEARCH AS THE ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION VECTOR
Proposal: Develop incentives for companies to enter a
ecological transition process
To support companies that are committed in an ecological transition process, it
either by developed products or services or through their internal organization, projects
Research with a positive impact on sustainable development will be favored, whether
an environmental value (waste management, pollution reduction,
improved energy consumption or redirected ...), social (reduction of inequality, inclusion
social, health improvement ...) or transverse (interdisciplinary participation of the parties
actors ...). For this purpose, "positive ratchet" type mechanisms should be set up or
reinforced. It may be a priority given to sustainable development criteria in
the ex ante evaluation of projects, or even a more favorable project funding
whose added value in terms of sustainable development is important; these criteria must
be set after consultation of stakeholders. Calls for projects dedicated to
sustainable development and ecological transition will also be launched.
Furthermore, the federal tax deduction for investment in R & D are not harmful to
the environment should be reviewed as it is granted today, for example, businesses
doing research on oil and / or subcontractor companies their entire R & D
the other end of the world.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter RESEARCH AND INNOVATION - p 7/17

Proposal: To advocate for a quick procedure for obtaining patents
Societal to the EU
A relatively long period and disheartening can flow between when an inventor
introduces a patent application and its issuance by the competent authority (at EU level
eg the European Patent Office (EPO)). The EU should be guided by the temporary procedure
launched in the United States to drastically shorten the time in the field of energy
green to boost competitiveness and disseminating expertise.
Such so-called fast track procedure should be of application for patents related to
innovation and inventions to meet the "societal challenges" as définis7 in the 8th
Research Framework Programme and European innovation called Horizon 2020.
In case the EU speedily to follow this proposal, Belgium should take with tongue
partner countries at the EPO for this procedure applies to them.

Proposal: Create a "renewable energy" axis in the fund
Strategic Basic Research
Ecolo wants to find ways to be successful energy transition by financing the more
fundamental research in renewable energy. For too long, the nuclear sector
ate the largest share of subsidies allocated for basic research into energy. Creating
a new strategic axis dedicated to renewable energies within the new fund of LILE
FNRS, many research projects could be financed to meet the challenges of
resource depletion and protection of our environment.
Specifically, Ecolo proposes that:
credits for research and development of green energy production are
increased, including hydropower, tidal, wind and
geothermal, solar thermal, photovoltaics and gas from energy sources
renewable (biogas, syngas, biogas) as well as a recovery
efficient biomass;
this research not only aimed at improving the efficiency of energy
renewable but also to reduce the potential environmental impacts
(landscape integration of wind, smoke from burning biomass ...)
funds be mobilized for research and development on the storage
energy (including renewable gas) since it will be an addition
indispensable to the growing strength of the production of electricity from renewable sources.
Thanks to the platform responsible for the animation and valorisation of research in the
under the fund, the economic fabric of Wallonia and Brussels would be strengthened in this sector.
The axis dedicated to renewable energies should be adopt an annual budget of 6 million €, without
it would come at the expense of other funds FNRS since this is financings
external donor funds.

(e) the fight against climate change, resource efficiency and raw materials; and (f) companies
Inclusive, innovative and secure.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter RESEARCH AND INNOVATION - p 8/17

Proposal: Strengthening European research in energy
renewable
At European level (as at Belgian elsewhere), Ecolo regrets that, despite the progress
registered under Horizon 2020 (the EU Framework Programme for R & D), the Commission
EU to continue its strong support and priority to nuclear research or capture and
carbon storage. It is suitable for environmentalists to reverse priorities, affecting the
least 600 million € per year in renewable energies and energy savings. The
public financing of nuclear research should focus on research in
materials science, processing of radioactive waste and health.

Proposal: Abandon nuclear costly research projects
Finally, it should abandon all Belgian nuclear research project whose goal is to
develop better nuclear fuel (MOX and plutonium) and improve
reactor technology. This renunciation particularly concerns the Belgian research project
"Myrrha" nuclear. Indeed, it is in fact a new reactor plutonium capable of
produce new fuels (including MOX containing plutonium). The
Project developers also intend to support research in the so-called fourth reactor
generating and studying the extension of the lifetime of the reactors. Ecolo can subscribe to
such projects.

Proposal: Fund PAI FWB a view of interdisciplinarity, to
same height at the federal level
The Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP) is a research program
Federal funding for basic research networks. The current phase
Funding covers the period from 1st January 2012 to 30 June 2017. The state reform provides for the
Communitisation of this material. Ecolo wishes to maintain this tool at the Federation
Wallonia-Brussels with the same financial resources at the federal level. These are based on PAI
the networking of researchers from Belgium Communities in areas of excellence
where it is crucial to achieve critical mass for European and international influence
of all the Belgian scientific community in these areas where the quality of researchers
Belgium is recognized. It is not to favor certain themes, but to ask
researchers to enroll in an interdisciplinary approach.

Proposal: To integrate experts from different disciplines in the process
selection and foster interdisciplinary projects
Ecolo wants interdisciplinary projects have as much chance of being selected as
other. Indeed, interdisciplinarity is essential to meet the challenges we
face, such lengthening the life of healthy or supply
energy.
During the first Interdisciplinary Congress on Sustainable Development in 2013, participants
could appreciate the richness that resulted from the involvement of scientists in different disciplines
contributions that were discussed on this occasion. This approach can be extended beyond
Science for sustainable development, interdisciplinary in nature. Indeed, the fact of
evaluating a research project, whatever it is, by experts from different disciplines present
a great advantage:
If the project is mono-disciplinary, non-expert from the promoter of the discipline brings
different and original light on the project of the latter;

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter RESEARCH AND INNOVATION - p 9/17

If the project is interdisciplinary, the promoter may receive each own review
disciplines integrated into the project.
It will therefore be to adapt the selection procedure to give to research projects
Interdisciplinary (especially those between the humanities and the natural sciences or
between the humanities and life sciences) a chance of being funded.

Proposal: Promoting diversity of economic thought
Ecolo is in favor of a reform of doctoral education and academic science sector
economic to offer interdisciplinary training, disciplinary and fitting in
a sustainable strong growth, in order to release a pluralism of economic thought,
only able to provide appropriate responses to the current economic crisis.

Proposal: To mobilize European research on societal challenges
At European level, the new Knowledge Innovation Communities (KICs or "communities
Knowledge and innovation ") to be launched early in 2018 must take the path of the
ecological transition of the economy. The KICs are self-focused partnerships
excellence, bringing together higher education institutions, research institutes,
companies and other stakeholders in the form of viable and strategic networks
Long-term self in the field of innovation.
Ecolo also proposes to create, like the dynamic that has been engaged with
European Coal and Steel Community 60 years ago, a European community
renewable energy in the context of a reform of the Treaties to be held early in the
législature8 next. The Commission should be more ambitious in monitoring initiativesphares such as Innovation Union, Digital Europe or Resource Efficiency Platform, linked
with these areas more vigilant in monitoring the implementation in the Member States
and rigorous in identifying good practices that could be disseminated in
other countries.

PRIORITY 3: BUILDING ON SCIENCE AND SOCIAL INNOVATION
Taking the foot against a vision following which the research is too often exploited
the benefit of economic growth alone, Ecolo promotes increased support to research that
considering other paradigms, which aims to change the economic model rather than improving
our performance in the current model to better understand social phenomena, the
springs inequalities, etc.
All scientific disciplines are involved and all involved in welfare. They
in this regard are essential to solve the many challenges we
face (global warming, pollution, health for all, inequality and poverty, etc.).
Book substantial resources to the humanities part of this will.

Proposal: Fund research programs aimed at
social development of Wallonia and Brussels
For too long, at the regional level, research has only been seen as a vehicle of
economic development and was funded in this single goal. Thus, while demonstrating their
interest, it is mainly the industrial and technological research that has been supported
8

On this subject sections "Energy and Climate" and "Europe".

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter RESEARCH AND INNOVATION - p 10/17

Regional public. However, non-technological and social innovation can be equally
the levers of a strong regional development, both economically and / or socially.
It is therefore appropriate to continue the efforts made during the 2009-2014 term. It is broaden
the scope of thematic research programs that are launched at
regional, or launch calls for projects specifically dedicated to social development
(evaluation of the development of research into the economic fabric, associations and / or policy).
Including via clusters via research institutes and WAL-TECH. There
Brussels legislation should be reviewed so that the ASBL and local authorities can benefit
financing if they participate in research projects and social innovation, as
labs9 example of living.

Proposal: Develop valuation vis-à-vis research
all players

For ten years, economic and academic circles are close together, so
as universities and companies work better together on research projects,
notably through the competitiveness clusters. These activities may see economic benefits
direct for universities (revenues from patents or the creation of spin-offs) and
companies (development of high value-added activities); they contribute to
economic development of Wallonia and Brussels. But such partnerships should
also be promoted vis-à-vis other actors (citizens, public authorities, non-profit organization, society
Civil).
However, they do not necessarily have an economic impact and can not be
"Recouped" by this means; Therefore it is crucial that governments develop and
finance tools to achieve this mission. Ecolo considers that these partnerships will
a positive impact on the social development of Wallonia and Brussels.

Proposal: Decompartmentalising R & D & I in companies and involve
all workers and all workers
Following the agreement for 2007-2008, the social partners have adopted a series of
Documents to stimulate a culture of innovation.
In one of them, it was reported that, in addition to the content of jobs, the choice of
organizational structure, management system and resource management, "the
structure of the organization may also affect the degree of innovation. It is important in this context
horizontal links that are forged between various corporate entities (R & D, marketing,
production …). Innovation is however not an area reserved for managers of the various
departments; it concerns all workers. The customer service workers
have such good information useful for the realization of new
products / services. But the workers of the production section can also bring
valuable information. So is certainly so when such an adaptation of
machinery they use. Beyond the horizontal linkages within the organization, links between
the company and external stakeholders are also important. Collaboration with customers
eg to better define the innovations and reduce the risk of introduction
market new products or services. A survey of a sample of 221
Belgian companies shows that collaboration with suppliers and customers has influence

A Living Lab brings together public, private, companies, associations, individual actors, with the aim
test "scale" services, tools or new uses. They are out looking for
laboratories to move down in the life of every day, often with a strategic view of the uses
potential of these technologies. All this happens in cooperation between local authorities, businesses,
research laboratories, as well as potential users. This is to foster open innovation, sharing networks
and involve users from the beginning of the design.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter RESEARCH AND INNOVATION - p 11/17

significant percentage of the revenue generated by the improved products. Outraged
vis-à-vis external actors open, flexible structures, a flat hierarchy and
decentralization of decision-making are often conducive to innovation "(CEC report
Technical 2006)
Therefore Ecolo proposes to amend the 1973 Royal Decree defines the information
economic, financial and social issues that must be submitted to the works council in order to
ensure that subjects relating to research policy, development and innovation
companies or that may affect the latter are discussed in the works council.

Proposal: Increase the number of stock FRESH
The FRESH Fund (basic research in the humanities) is for mandates
research and collective research, including, in addition to personnel, equipment and
operation. It was created in 2012 on the initiative of ECOLO within the FNRS as a point of
start of a search for balance between the funding of different disciplines.
The first FRESH calls have met with a success that demonstrates the real need to which they
meet. In order to pursue the refinancing of humanities, Ecolo offers
align resources allocated to fund FRESH those allocated to the Fund to FRIA10
to offer each year more mandates and research projects for researchers
social science.

PRIORITY 4: RESEARCH FOR THE COMPANY
Proposal: To finance programs to support the decision, at all levels of
able
Researchers, both in Wallonia and Brussels, have skills and knowledge that
are useful to policy makers. But it is still necessary that the public authorities have
knowledge. The FNRS finance free basic research and basic research
Strategic (via LILE). The decision support falls into this second category. Like a
attention is paid to the valuation, and that all levels of government can finance the axes
Strategic created in this context, it is launching a new line dedicated to research in
Scientific support for public policies without prejudice to any other funds.

Proposal: Consult stakeholders on new projects
research programs
Ecolo wants to strengthen the link between civil society and researchers supporting, as has
started in the Brussels-Capital Region, the organization of consultations with the social partners,
ASBL and NGOs concerned about new research programs. It would allow
identify priority needs and expectations of the population.

Proposal: Awareness of Science
Research is a vehicle for progress facing new challenges that society meeting.
Understand science is to understand the world around us is give us
the opportunity to act on it in order to anticipate the major changes that we must and will

to face. To achieve this, we want to intensify advocacy for research
science, science and technical occupations by proposing the establishment of a network
bringing together all those concerned about the lack of interest and improve science
the dissemination of scientific culture: all actors and partners from science and
technical, teachers regardless of the age of their students, but also the partners
research and industry and scientists of civil society, journalists in the field, the
responsible for museums, exhibition and scientific awareness.
It should also work on different levels of education and to promote
synergies between entities (FWB, RW, RBC and Federal) rethinking teaching
sciences from primary to secondary, placing experimentation at the center of learning
science and making visible and concrete the research profession among young people, all
disciplines.

Proposal: Continue implementation of technology assessment institutes
(EIT-TA) promoting reflection and public debate on social issues and
upstream research to lead
The Technology Assessment is to assess the impact of developments in science and
technology on society to make better policy decisions and stimulate
debate and public participation on themes as varied as, for example, energy
renewable, ICT, GMOs, nanotechnology or mobility.
This public debate on scientific and technical issues, the formation of political opinion
in science, technology and innovation, their interactions with society and their
impact in decision making is a challenge to continue and requires a favorable place
the debate. The continued development of technology assessment institutes at all levels
power (the European Regional) is involved in this issue.

Proposal: To ensure free access to the results of publicly funded research
public funds
The results of basic research that benefit from public subsidies should be
published in open access (open access). It's the same for publications that are supported by
of public funds.
Moreover, the ethical principles of the Helsinki Declaration requires that the data produced
or collected (in Europe or elsewhere in the world) by research funded by the powers
public and conducted on humans, for example in clinical trials are made
public.
This proposal should be given to all relevant power levels. Ecolo ensure the implementation
implementation of the Brussels Declaration, in which the various ministers responsible for
Research in Belgium have made commitments to open access publication of
Research funded by public money.

Proposal: To apply the precautionary principle to nano-products / technologies
In the wake of several reports adopted by the European Parliament since 2004,
Environmentalists continue to advocate strongly with the Commission in favor of a
regulations on nanotechnology to ensure the security of Europeans and to avoid
risk of environmental disturbances. The lack of a unified definition of nano-products
(substances) which takes account both of their size, shape and properties
specific to the nanoscale, has the consequence that they escape to the time

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter RESEARCH AND INNOVATION - p 13/17

different regulations (health, safety of products (cosmetics, packaging,
food additives, etc.), REACH), giving rise to multiple unrated exposure situations.
Following a recent review of REACH11 (2012), the Commission itself has yet well recognized
that businesses had not taken adequate measures to ensure the safe use
nanomaterials. The required legislation by the Ecologists must aim to provide information on
uses and impacts of nanomaterials and to establish an inventory, to develop a
European authorization for the nano-product market (AMMN). In the meantime, Eco
advocates the introduction of a moratorium on the commercialization of products containing
nanoparticles. Finally - and this decision can already be taken at regional level -, half of
Research on these new financing techniques, in terms of teams and budgets,
must be dedicated to the health, environmental and social issues.

PRIORITY 5: ACCELERATING THE MARKETING OF R & D & I
Proposal: to reform and simplify innovation aid for SMEs
Belgium produces a lot of knowledge but often difficult to value them. Furthermore,
10 most active companies concentrate third of spending on R & D & I! Now our fabric
Economic is dominated by SMEs. Therefore in order to promote the resilience of our
productive ecosystem and to encourage (re) localization of research activities and
entrepreneurship development, Ecolo wants to reform the innovation aid intended for
Streamlining SMEs, boosting their effects, playing on the simplification of procedures and
shortening processing times.
Ecolo also plans to increase the technological ceiling check to correct the lack
Indexing of it since its launch in 2009. Thus, the acquisition by SMEs 40
checks amounting to € 500 would give him the right to seek an approved research center
or a High School for a value of € 25,000 (instead of € 20,000 currently). Ecolo
consider whether to expand the partners to private external providers.

Proposal: To ensure that public interest organizations support
innovation in SMEs
Ecolo calls for regional governments to ensure that, in a spirit of partnership
public-private, economic public interest organizations support the R & D & I in SMEs. The
AIXPé program developed in Île de France can serve as useful inspiration for that purpose. This
Program helps SOHO and SMEs to lend credibility to their projects with investors
demonstrating the potential return on investment. To do this, companies compare their
Project to stakeholders in the region over a period of 6-18 months period that helps move
the product to make it stick better to user needs (participative innovation). Projects
selected are destined to be implanted in the regional territory and are chosen by an institution
public business financing, how to Sowalfin. The expenses subsidized
are intangible investments, provision of services, outsourcing and
depreciation of equipment, costs of patenting / Industrial Property charges
Mission / symposium personnel costs. The projects are then monitored and a
accompaniment by a similar agency in the Agency for Enterprise and Innovation. Through a
knowledge finer the public's ability to take possession of their project, they can improve
their products and services. In this way, projects contribute to strengthening ties with the actors
local economic.

REACH refers to the 2006 European regulation to register, evaluate and authorize chemicals to
to minimize risk.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter RESEARCH AND INNOVATION - p 14/17

Proposal: Use public procurement as leverage to speed up
the R & D market
The "pre-commercial public procurements" (PCP) are a form of intended procurement
encourage R & D companies and validating the fruits of research, while improving
quality and efficiency of public services such as transport or energy. So, they of
participate in the meeting of sociétaux12 challenges.
Manifesting as an opening for innovative solutions to businesses and
researchers, governments encourage them to engage in such research projects and
develop prototypes because the key, they have the guarantee of obtaining profits and
to test their products to the authorities before deploying them on a larger scale.
For their part, governments have the opportunity to compare various alternatives before
to stop their choice.
Based on different experiences to date, Ecolo wants the Regions undertake
in this way and evaluate the possibility to reserve every year a certain percentage of
Volume of public procurement to PCP.

The financial crisis - still in progress since its outbreak in summer 2007 in the US - has
exposed to light excesses of a financial system left to itself, which will benefit
today that the "1%" the richest of the world population by the so-called
Indignados movement. In degenerating into economic and social crisis, it has also

finance, the fining of leaders and traders, or at the end of the socialization
losses, are innumerable.
However, the facts show that, so far, these repeat ads have rarely been
implemented.
Thus, as examples, an investor can always ensure, by means of derivatives,
against the risks to which it is not exposed ... what makes the realization of these risks
desirable for him; tax havens - outside and even within Europe - continue to
prosper ; systemic financial institutions at the root of the 2008 crisis have become
even more powerful today; Finally, European regulators launched in 2010 for
Banks (EBA), insurance (EIOPA) and financial markets (ESMA) have very
exceptionally binding powers.
Certainly cloudy appear in this bleak sky co-legislator on
financial regulation, the European Parliament succeeded in forcing significant progress in
this area during the 2009-2014 term. Ecolo and the European Greens are largely
contributed, being the source of legislative amendments on the capping of bonuses, the
bank transparency, imposition of additional capital for banks
systemic, or the ban on CDS (Credit Default Swaps) exposed on sovereign debt.
In Belgium, Ecolo has also been influential in financial matters, in
framework of parliamentary commissions that followed the bankruptcy of Fortis and Dexia, trying to
bring out the individual and collective responsibilities, formulating proposals
in-depth reform and tabling legislative proposals to this effect, in particular to the
separation of banking activities, allocation of savings in sustainable projects, guidance
pension funds, the taxation of stock market operations or funds requirements
clean and bank caution.

The political horizon Ecolo in economic and financial regulation
Nevertheless, the road to re-finance order is still long and strewn with remains
with pitfalls; resistance to change are important. The success of such an undertaking
depend not only an unwavering political will, but also a strong
Citizens and media pressure. The combination of these three components is essential for
counteract the incessant lobbying of the financial industry. In addition, care should be taken in this
that the proposed solutions are articulated between the European level and the national level. There
current crisis clearly shows that enhanced cooperation between Member States is
necessary. However, the importance of solutions to be implemented at European level can not
be an excuse not to take measures that may be at the national level,
begin by banks with public participation. More than ever, it is appropriate
to apply the principle of subsidiarity wisely.

The Ecolo force lines
Ecolo has a clear and precise roadmap for financial regulation. Both
Major priorities in this context are:
Reforming the banking sector
Strengthen supervision of markets in financial instruments

Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: BANKING REFORM
Proposal: Separate the banking business
For Ecolo, it is essential to implement structural reforms in the banking sector.
These must necessarily meet three objectives:
protect citizens' savings;
to finance the real economy;
ensure fair competition between systemic banks and retail banks.
The simplest and most effective way to achieve this is to introduce a separation of trades
bank. This allows, in fact, not only to isolate the essential services to the community
(credit to households and non-financial companies, the payment system, deposits
guaranteed, etc.) non-core services (speculative activities) but also to stop
the existence of financial institutions "too big to fail."
Ecolo proposes to impose a strict separation between retail banks and banks
investment. This is to reorganize the universal banks (which include all
finance compartments), forcing them to opt for the status:
or a retail banking - providing essential services for the collection of savings and
credit granting and enjoying therefore, under certain terms and conditions of
the state protection;
is an investment bank taking care of complex financial transactions
(IPOs, mergers and acquisitions, bond issues,
share subscriptions, etc.) and executing orders in markets on behalf of
clients or for own account.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter REGULATION BANKING AND FINANCE - p 2/15

In this perspective, only banks with a license "retail banking" are allowed
to collect deposits from savers and benefit from public support (guarantee on
deposits and access to the discount window of the Central Bank). In return, they must
devoted to credit and can hold securities in proportions that very
limited.
Conversely, banks opting for the license "investment bank" are allowed to
execute orders in markets on behalf of clients or for own account, but
can neither take deposits nor benefit from retail banking lines of credit, or count
on guarantees or state intervention in case of problems. This is the preferred route by Ecolo.
Some propose, instead of a strict separation, to establish a bulkhead within
universal banks. This option is to isolate - within the same banking group -
essential services of non-essential services by establishing legally separate entities.
Ecolo considers the option of strict separation more efficient, a partitioning strategy
can be effective only if solid firewall - limiting the risk of contagion
between separate entities - are in place.
More specifically, such firewall should then aim to:
restrict transfers of capital and liquidity between the entity providing services
essential and other entities of the group;
strictly limit the exposure of the entity providing essential services to banks and
unregulated entities within or outside the group, which are engaged in activities
risky market.
In addition, for Ecolo, it is essential that each legally separate entities has
own funding sources and that the rules on leverage and liquidity - adjusted
Depending on the business model - they are applied.
However, given its highly complex nature of the partitioning approach risk
to be more easily circumvented than a strict separation of banking activities. Ecolo
therefore intends to emphasize his preference for the latter option.

Proposal: Achieving banking union

The 2008 crisis revealed how many co-existing bank regulatory systems
the time within the EU were uncoordinated, each of which is based on rules
national, with national rescue measures.
This lack of coordination has states unable to respond effectively to
the collapse of the European banking sector and its spread in the market for sovereign debt.
When euro summit of 29 June 2012, the Heads of State and Government have therefore
agreed on the need to build a banking union based on three main pillars:
a guarantee system for single deposits;
a single banking supervisor;
a common system of management and bank resolution.
Establish a common European banking supervision
The establishment of an integrated European supervision of banks - first milestone of a union
bank - was the subject of an agreement between the European Parliament and the Council 19 March 2013.
For Ecolo, the choice of Member States to place the responsibility for the supervision of banks
with the European Central Bank (ECB) is certainly not the most appropriate option.
The creation of a new monitoring body via a treaty change would indeed made
the best solution.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter REGULATION BANKING AND FINANCE - p 3/15

The compromise reached in March 2013 nevertheless provides a framework of the new powers
supervision vested in the ECB, including limiting potential conflicts of interest (strict
separation between monetary policy and the ECB surveillance missions). The requirement
ECB comply with the decisions of the European Banking Authority obtained by
binding mediation is also a positive aspect of the new legislation on
banking supervision.
That said, Ecolo deplores the still too limited character of the new powers of control
European Parliament on banking supervisory activities of the ECB. Under the terms of the agreement
Interinstitutional concluded in September 2013 between the two institutions, only information
considered most important by the ECB will be transmitted to Parliament. But for Ecolo, the
Parliament should have full access to the minutes of Council meetings
monitoring of the ECB and the Governing Council on supervisory issues.
Establish an effective framework for bank resolution
For Ecolo, it is essential to establish, at European level, a sound mechanism and integrated
management of bank failures.
In Belgium, Dexia and Fortis cases have amply demonstrated that in the absence of such a system
single bank resolution process proves not only extremely chaotic, but
also very costly to the taxpayer.
Ecolo is therefore favorable to the next introduction of a single resolution mechanism (MRU)
the prospect of a banking union. This implies in particular the establishment of a
Single resolution Council - responsible for overseeing the implementation of resolution plans
banks in a crisis - and the establishment of a single bank resolution funds
supplied by contributions from the banking sector and replacing resolution funds
nationals of Member States of the euro area and the Member States participating in the banking union.
For Ecolo, the effectiveness of future MRU depend on two key factors. Firstly, it is
crucial that the Commission has the power to trigger the resolution of a bank.
Recent experience shows indeed the existence of unhealthy links between the States and
banks. Collusion between political elites and executives of the banking industry
often led governments to place the interests of banks on those of their
citizens. Second, regarding the future single bank resolution fund, it is essential
to provide voting rules guaranteeing the possibility of a real sharing of costs of
bank resolution between Member States.
Finally, note that in the future MRU banking union apply the rules under the "Directive
the recovery and resolution of banking crises, "which was the subject of the agreement
12 December 2013. The adopted text - whose main objective is to minimize
taxpayer's exposure to banking crises - provides that troubled banks should
priority be saved by their shareholders and their creditors (the "bail-in") rather
by taxpayers (the "bail-out") 1.
Ecolo regrets two major weaknesses in this new legislation. The first is that,
under pressure from the finance ministers of the EU, it will be possible for States to recapitalize their
banks in a "preventive". Ecolo and European Greens have nevertheless obtained a
priori examination of any request by the European Commission, which should give the green light.
The second weakness concerns the management of cross-border banking crises, a case that
Belgium knows only too well (Fortis, Dexia ...). Ecolo and the will of the European Greens was
in case of crisis in a transnational bank and if the authorities in charge of managing
the crisis can not agree, the European Banking Authority (EBA) to exercise a role of jugearbitre. That battle was lost before the Council: in such cases, instead of having a
1

Specifically, the text provides that in general, shareholders and creditors will have to intervene to cover any
losing up to 8% of the balance sheet is before a crisis resolution funds - powered by banks - either State may
intervene.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter REGULATION BANKING AND FINANCE - p 4/15

truly integrated resolution process, national authorities may deviate plans
burden sharing established in advance.
Establish a system to guarantee deposits only
Recent experience has revealed how national deposit guarantee schemes are not
been able - in several Member States - to maintain depositor confidence towards
their banking system.
This distrust is manifested particularly in Greece and Spain which occurred in 2012
capital flight to other countries in the euro zone, which contributed to deteriorate the situation
economic and social of the two countries.
On 18 December 2013 the European Parliament and the Council reached an agreement to strengthen
harmonization of national deposit guarantee schemes. Specifically, deposits
savings less than € 100,000 will now be secured by funds financed by the banks
(depending risk2 profile), rather than by taxpayers. These funds - established in each State
member - will reach 0.8% of covered deposits within ten years. In addition,
Depositors will be able to get their money within a period of seven working days.
While important, the conclusion of this agreement is nevertheless a step
intermediate.
In the medium term, Ecolo defends the realization of the third pillar of the banking union, namely the
creating a European deposit guarantee fund. This is the only truly effective way
to restore confidence of depositors to their banking system.
In the meantime the future establishment of such a European mechanism supports the Ecolo
refinancing by financial institutions of the Belgian deposit guarantee system. In
Specifically, it is necessary that reserves of the deposit protection funds cover at least
5% of deposits held by banks.
Finally, Ecolo considers it appropriate to consider seriously the proposal to oblige
banks active in Belgium to pledge assets of good quality and well diversified collateral
to cover their savings deposits. In case of bank bankruptcy, the state could benefit from these
guarantees, which would reduce all costs related to a possible bailout.

Proposal: Strengthen prudential rules
Increase capital requirements
Number of European banks are still largely under-capitalized. In other words,
they do not have their own funds (ie funds that they have not had to borrow)
sufficient to absorb potential losses.
The provisions in the new European banking regulations ("CRDIV") approved by the European Parliament 16 April 2013 - predict an increase in requirements
capital, these from 8 to 10.5%.
In addition, with the amendments introduced by the European Greens, equity
Additional (1% to 3.5%) are now imposed on banks called "systemic risk", that is to say that the possible bankruptcy would have serious consequences on the financial system and the economy
actual, in particular because of their size and complexity.
If these new provisions undoubtedly help to strengthen the financial soundness of
European banks, they remain nonetheless insufficient. Underlines in particular the Ecolo
need to adopt a much more differentiated approach depending on the risk profile of

2

The banks with riskier activities contribute more.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter REGULATION BANKING AND FINANCE - p 5/15

financial institutions. Capital requirements applied to systemic banks
in particular should be substantially identified (at least up to 16%).
Ending bonus
Remuneration outsized bankers and traders, and the method of calculating these generate
multiple perverse effects, such as increased wage inequality, risk taking
Excessive, short-termism or circumvention of the laws.
As part of the third revision of the European directive on capital
regulatory ("CRDIV"), capping bonuses was approved through amendments
introduced by the European Greens.
Under the new provisions, the variable remuneration of bankers and traders will no longer
exceed the total amount of their fixed salary (1-1 ratio), unless the shareholders give
explicitly agree to higher bonus, with a maximum ratio of 2-1.
While this is an important step forward, Ecolo consider it insufficient. Ultimately, it
appropriate to fix the maximum amount of bonus of the annual fixed salary to 50%. In
Furthermore, Ecolo supports limiting the income of executives, by capping
remuneration (fixed salary and bonus) higher to 10 times the average of the lowest wages in the
bank. Note that currently, it is not uncommon - in the financial sector - the most salary
high is 200 times higher than the lowest wages.
Delete the "golden parachutes"
Similarly, severance, more commonly called "golden parachutes" paid
business leaders excite deep and legitimate indignation among the population
currently undergoing the adverse consequences of mistakes made by them.
Ecolo proposes to end the practice of golden parachutes, these excessive bonuses
some executives and business leaders at the end of their contract or terms of reference and which are
sometimes real premiums mismanagement. To achieve this goal, we wish
simply ban such practices wherever possible and particularly in
public institutions or public participation. We suggest, when not possible,
to simply ban these practices, to apply a deterrent taxation on
Excessive amounts of compensation, eliminating the need for such output bonuses, eg
applying a tax rate of 75% 3 of severance payments exceeding € 250 000 or
months' pay per year of seniority in the company.
In anticipation of this legislation, it is appropriate that the Belgian State leads by example by preventing
practice of "golden parachute" at public companies of which he is a shareholder.
Limit debt of banks
Recent experience has shown that the banks - especially large ones - can
easily circumvent capital constraints (or "equity") by manipulating the level of
risk weighting of their assets. Such a maneuver allows them to reduce accordingly the
total amount of assets in the face of which they should put the capital and, therefore, the
total amount of capital they must have to comply with the constraints
regulations.
Certainly, the new banking legislation ("CRDIV") plans to submit internal models
calculating risk banks in a standard evaluation portfolio ', in order to limit the
practices to underestimate credit risk and market risk.
For Ecolo, it is necessary to go further by applying to banks a leverage ratio
restrictive. This ratio - crudest but less manipulable - simply refers funds
3

A rate of 75% being considered by the State Council as the maximum acceptable rate of taxation.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter REGULATION BANKING AND FINANCE - p 6/15

own total non-weighted assets according to risk. Fixing it at an adequate level,
limits the share of the bank's assets is financed by debt. Ecolo therefore calls
the European Commission to adopt a legislative proposal to this effect emergency and
well before the date officially fixed (ie December 2016).
Introduce liquidity rules
Too many European banks are still heavily dependent on short-term financing
obtained on the capital markets, which exposes them to risks of liquidity (inability to
generate sufficient resources to meet its payment obligations when
they become due) and refinancing (inability to raise funds on the market at a
acceptable price to refinance commitments).
To minimize this source of fragility, Ecolo supports the adoption at European level of two
key provisions of Basel III reforms, namely the short-term liquidity ratio (LCR) and
Long-term liquidity ratio (NSFR). The first is a short-term ratio which compliance demands
detention by the bank in the amount of high-quality liquid assets enabling it to
resisting for 30 days in a crisis. The second is to encourage banks to resort to sources
stable funding to finance their activities.
If the new European banking legislation ("CRDIV") provides well the gradual introduction of a
LCR from 2018, she has no plans in the medium term adoption of an NSFR.
Without an appropriate European framework for liquidity risk management is Ecolo
supports the adoption of national provisions in this field, such as taxation sources
unstable banks financing (ie repo operations, short debts
term, etc.), to encourage more stable sources of financing (equity, savings
long term, etc.).

Proposal: Regulate the "shadow banking system"
The crisis has highlighted the need to regulate the banking system called "parallel" - called
also "shadow banking system" ("shadow banking") - which means the intermediation system
and credit distribution outside the traditional banking system. Specifically, the system
covers shadow banking entities and activities such as securitization transactions
(processing of credit securities), the operations of 'repurchase' (REPO) between banks and
non-banks, money market funds, hedge funds, specialized financial corporations, etc.
The Financial Stability Board (FSB) estimated the size of the global shadow banking system
some 51,000 billion € in 2011. End of 2010, he represented Belgium near
140 billion €.
With the adoption of new prudential rules, many banks will
strongly tempted to transfer part of their activities to the shadow banking system
is little box. It is therefore urgent to adopt legal provisions to prevent
risk of accumulation in this sector.
In particular, Ecolo supports the adoption of the following measures at European level:
limiting total exposure of banks to unregulated financial entities to a threshold
equivalent to 25% of their capital;
limiting the ability to reuse the financial assets received as collateral for contracting
new borrowing on financial markets ("rehypothecation");
strictly limit the issuance of securitized products, allowing only entities
specialized (subject to specific regulatory regime) to conduct such activities
or at least limiting the securitizable share of banks' credit portfolios;

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter REGULATION BANKING AND FINANCE - p 7/15

establish a central registry to collect and monitor real-time data
on risk transfers (including transfers made through the
derivatives transactions).

Proposal: Outlawing the use of tax havens
It is unrealistic to expect the banks regulate more effectively if no provision is made in
Parallel to prevent them from installing subsidiaries in tax havens. Their presence in these
secrecy jurisdictions allows them to circumvent the legislation in order to pay less tax, or
to take risks in complete opacity.
The new European banking legislation (CRDIV) introduces a provision on history
the fight against tax havens: in 2015, banks will be required to disclose
publicly for all countries where they operate, details of their activities, particularly
profits and losses, taxes paid and subsidies received, the staff employed and the name
legal entities in which they operate. This is an important political victory
Since the requirement of a country by country Accounting is a claim that was brought
Ecolo and by the European Greens in the early negotiations on banking reform.
In the context of the Offshore Leaks, it is clear that such an obligation for banks will make
their tax planning activities increasingly untenable. A financial institution may benefit from public support or even partly or wholly owned by a
State - that performs hundreds of millions of profits in such a Caribbean island or sea
Ireland, by employing one person and paid virtually no taxes, is not
acceptable.
If these bank transparency measures are essential, they must nevertheless be accompanied
in the future to more stringent in the fight against tax havens. In
especially Ecolo supports the application of sanctions to banks involved in
offshore activities. These should include, in particular, the withdrawal of the banking license,
the prohibition to use personal savings (that is to say, take deposits), or
yet the taxation of financial flows to and from companies located in
tax heavens. Regarding the latter, a Belgian bank that would - for example - a
off-balance sheet investment vehicle in an offshore center, would be taxed in Belgium on
profits that are generated there. Taxation should be sufficiently dissuasive to discourage
completely the constitution of such offshore companies.
Ultimately, Ecolo simply wants an end to tax havens, which destabilize
the global economy at the expense of developing countries, the real economy and
Financing missions of States.

Proposal: Promoting financial relocation
Public and cooperative banks
Ecolo intends to support the development of public banks and cooperative banks
focused on the financing of the economy and individuals locally.
Furthermore, the maintenance of public control exerted on banks that received Plan
Rescue should in any case be conditional on meeting strict criteria in terms of interest
public, transparency of financial activities and internal governance.
Credit associations
Ecolo also promote the creation of "credit associations", drawing
including former "Bank counters" who cooperated until the 1990s
with CGER and Crédit Communal. Such a group would bring together local associations
individuals and local institutions collecting money to guarantee loans granted

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter REGULATION BANKING AND FINANCE - p 8/15

locally at small businesses and even individuals. The financing
these credits would be provided by banks or investment funds and mutual funds specializing in
Investment in SME loans or mortgages.
This would situate the granting of credit in local support between
Lenders and contractors, which promotes knowledge of the players and opportunities of the
region, a personalized relationship and therefore advice and guidance.
The Walloon Invests
The Invests are not isolated instances; they must be the spearhead of a policy
Regional proactive, coordinated and bold.
Ecolo proposes that:
banks are obliged to inform their customers of the existence of public tools
financing and support of creation or development of a
economic activity ;
the Invests formally commit to a common and shared strategic vision with
the Walloon Government and that they are part of the pursuit of clear and focused objectives
set by GW to accelerate the socio-economic redeployment;
the Invests equip themselves with a more flexible analysis of risks, in order to compensate, in
key sectors for regional development, the reluctance of financial institutions
this time of crisis;
Invests shall have in the more aggressive investment criteria. In addition to the criteria
severe economic and commercial existing, IOPs must be able to integrate
criteria that focus on the major assets to modernize the economy: R & D markets
new and porters, integration of social and environmental standards;
financing new Walloon Invests preferably based on drawing rights
will be granted after an ex post analysis of the conformity of the tool with politics
region and the results achieved, so that the allocations correspond to real
needs and are not hoarded to establish their independence;
availability of financial Invests be consolidated into a common pool. To
to encourage them to put cash in the service of the real economy and the transition and
to take more risks, Invests should support economic agents
so that the net cash rate as a percentage of assets
Financial does not exceed a certain threshold.
Wallonia Investment Fund
Ecolo finally proposes that the Investment Fund Wallonia (CIW) shifting its "business
model "of SME financing by pooling smaller projects and for securitizing
that institutional investors are interested in their custody. Thus, this will cause
a reduction in the cost of credit for SMEs. A term.4, Ecolo proposed the liquidation of the CIW, which
duplicates other Walloon tools. In parallel, the repatriation operations
SME financing in SOWALFIN be made.

Proposal: Orient savings towards sustainable development
Ecolo intends to orientate investments towards sustainable development by acting on two
levers.

4

This will only intervene in 2019, year of maturity of the bonds issued in 2009.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter REGULATION BANKING AND FINANCE - p 9/15

The first is a lasting orientation of the pension funds of the second and third pillar
reserves the vieillissement5 Fund. Specifically, the objective of this proposal is to
bring to a 5-year average holding period of pension fund investments in
Companies relying on the tax lever: the tax benefit would not be granted if the duration
average is not recorded. Such a provision would fight against "courttermisme 'pension funds which nourishes the casino economy, gradually focusing their
investments toward promising activities of social and environmental improvements.
The second lever is to force banks to offer a "passbook vert6" whose
calculation of interest would be simplified and whose deposits are oriented towards project financing
Endogenous high environmental and social value. The objective of such a measure - inspired
the Livret de Développement Durable (LDD) French - is to quickly inject tens of
billion € in the Belgian economy and in job creation, for example for construction
or renovation of energy-efficient housing, to finance
investment by SMEs or local authorities.

PRIORITY 2: TAKE CONTROL OF FINANCIAL MARKETS
Proposal: To strengthen the supervision of financial markets
The crisis revealed the disadvantages of the very national fragmentation of financial supervision
in Europe. Hence the establishment, in January 2011, the European Regulatory Authority
Financial Markets (ESMA), responsible for improving the harmonization of rules and practices
oversight.
For Ecolo, although the creation of ESMA is an undeniable progress, it is imperative, beyond modifying the implementing rules for the financial sector, strengthen in the future
powers conferred on him. Specifically, it should expand the number of entities
pan-European under its direct supervision, currently centered solely on
rating agencies. The clearing in particular should it trouver7. Similarly,
the powers of ESMA for binding mediation in cases of persistent differences
between national supervisors should be systematically strengthened in all
European legislation on the regulation of financial markets.
Following the financial crisis, it was decided to entrust the Belgian Banking Supervision at the Bank
National and create on the ashes of the CBFA, a body to monitor products
Financial offered for sale: the Authority for Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA). In Ecolo there
will be essential in the future to improve the functioning and independence of this new authority
by framing new rules.

Proposal: Create public and independent credit rating agencies
Rating agencies have been instrumental in the spread of the financial crisis and
Bank: giving too favorable ratings to debt issued by their customers, they have overshadowed

some of the risks to buyers of these securities.
These agencies also have considerable influence on the survival of banks and
financial, without them being subjected to checks or have against powers or not of
responsibilities. In Belgium, the sudden change in the rating of Dexia and
precipitated the fall of Holding.

Ecolo has filed a bill to that effect February 13, 2006.
Ecolo has filed a bill to that effect September 6, 2012.
That does not currently provide the European regulation governing derivatives (EMIR).

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter REGULATION BANKING AND FINANCE - p 10/15

To better supervise their activities, a European regulation was adopted in April 20098.
The new European framework consists of five major steps: the transfer of monitoring
rating agencies to the European Regulatory Authority for Financial Markets (ESMA);
the establishment of a system of rotation of analysts and persons approving the
notations9; fixing 3 fixed dates per year for the issue of rating sovereign debt,
to prevent them from being issued unexpectedly; deleting references to 2020
"External ratings" in European law, to reduce the dependence of
ratings; the introduction of limits on holdings croisées10 to ensure that
conflicts of interest do not affect the quality of ratings.
Although these legal provisions are an obvious progress, they are still too
insufficient. Credit rating agencies still paid by presqu'intégralement
companies whose financial products they note. In other words, it is the student who pays
Professor who evaluates. Difficult to find a more obvious conflict of interest!
For Ecolo, the most credible alternative therefore remains the establishment of credit rating agencies
public and independent of which would be funded by the financial sector itself, via
automatic small contribution proportional to the value of securities issued.

Proposal: Submit financial products to authorization
of marketing
The exponential growth of financial products from the "financial innovation" that
characterized the past twenty years has contributed to the outbreak of the financial crisis, to
through the distribution of derivatives and asset-backed securities. For example, Fortis
Bank held in late June 2008 (three months before his rescue by governments
Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourg) nearly 42 billion € of complex structured products.
For Ecolo, given the negative economic impact of financial innovations, they must
be subject to security screening prior to their marketing. Especially since, in
other areas (consumer goods, industrial equipment, or drugs)
products must meet strict criteria and pass tests to access markets.
While the grant to the European Regulatory Authority Financial Markets (ESMA) power
temporarily prohibit or restrict financial activities that pose a risk to
financial stability is a positive step. However, this power can only be exercised
it is clearly defined in the sectoral legislation.
Ecolo is in favor of extending the powers of ESMA to make it to term
genuine European agency of financial products. This should in particular have the
able to appraise new financial products before marketing. Permission
marketing would be granted if the product tested has a real social utility. TO
any time - and indefinitely - ESMA should also have the right to withdraw
a product market systemic risk, speculative excesses or abuses
fraudulent.
In Belgium, Ecolo wants the powers of the FSMA products control requirements
Financial offered for sale are strengthened.
It is particularly urgent to reduce the ability of municipalities to use unconstrained
structured credits that allow them neither more nor less than to speculate on changes in interest rates
interest.

He is then subject to a first review in May 2011 and a second in January 2013.
In particular, the lead analysts may not be associated with the same rated entity for more than 4 years while
for rating analysts and persons approving the notes, these cycles are 5 and 7 years respectively.
10
When an investor holds shares simultaneously in at least two credit rating agencies, these actions
may not exceed 5% and shall be communicated to the public. In addition, the maximum contribution that an agency
may hold in another entity that mark is 10%.

Proposal: To regulate derivatives markets for
prevent or slow speculation
Insofar derivatives are increasingly used for purely
speculative, it is essential to strictly regulate the markets on which they are traded.
The adoption February 9, 2012 the European regulation governing financial derivatives
(EMIR) pursues this objective. This provides for the obligation for derivatives contracts
standardized mutual accord, to be offset by clearinghouses, whose role is
to continuously ensure the solvency of participants (by imposing an obligation of
Advance funds - called "security deposit" - as well as margin calls).
Although they allow for out of the shadows a whole section of the financial system,
provisions in EMIR are insufficient or even counterproductive. In
focusing risks - previously scattered opaquely - in rooms
compensation, the new European rules transform them into entities "too big

to fail ".
Faced with such systemic risks, Ecolo considers it necessary to place monitoring
clearing houses directly under the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).
In addition, it is essential to raise the bar for security deposits collected by rooms
compensation to their participants, insofar existing deposits are too little
high relative to the positions taken.
Nevertheless, for Ecolo, more efficient alternative to the clearing house mechanism
would be to introduce a tax on derivative liabilities résiduels11 entered in bank balance sheets.
The objective is to encourage banks to require or systematically provide financial securities
guarantee ("collateral") for their contracts OTC derivative agreement.

Proposal: Ending trading practices "high frequency"
The high frequency and algorithmic trading - market technique based on machines
able to execute orders at full speed (on the order of millionths of a second) - represents
Today 40% of equity trading in Europe. On Euronext Brussels, this practice is
the original third of the daily volume. These transactions have no economic justification
valid. They may, on the contrary, accentuate the difficulties and market imbalances and
to harm the corporate finance capacity.
For Ecolo, it is necessary to put an end to high-frequency trading practices
the following two reasons: firstly, this practice causes degradation of the quality of
markets (increase in total transaction costs, market manipulation, the problem of inequity,
etc.) and, on the other hand, it has no social or economic utility. Where is the interest
the real economy to speculate on the price action in five milliseconds?
As part of the revision of the European directive on markets in financial instruments
("MIF II"), the European Parliament and the Council agreed January 14, 2014 to limit the
high frequency trading by imposing a minimum time of attendance for every order
buying and selling on the market (500 milliseconds). Again, if this is in
common sense, Ecolo considers insufficient.
Ultimately, it is indeed to impose a tax on the amount of each modified or canceled order.
This would break the business model of high-frequency trading, without penalizing
long-term investors. Such a tax would be likely to end these practices
dangerous and destructive.

11

By "residual" we mean: after application of the compensation ("netting" in English) in the contract portfolio
OTC derivatives and net of collateral ("Collateral" in English) filed for these contracts.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter REGULATION BANKING AND FINANCE - p 12/15

Proposal: Introduce calming financial markets
Ecolo deems appropriate to introduce a maximum limit of 5 to 10% with fluctuations beyond
which the price of the security concerned would be suspended until the following day or even for a period
longer. Furthermore, abnormal transactions (very significant for sale or purchase orders issued
by a very small number of operators) should also lead to a suspension of
Trading overnight (or here also for a longer period), as these transactions are
often a sign of asymmetric information (insider trading) and distort the rules of the game.

Proposal: Regulating futures markets of raw materials
Currently, the markets for commodity derivatives, 69% of trade is linked to
speculative operations. These are involved in the increased volatility and
upward trend in prices of the underlying physical commodities (such as wheat,
corn, soybean, oil, copper, etc.), with particularly tragic consequences on the
Southern populations ability to nourrir12.
Note that banks active on the Belgian market are involved in activities covered
the realm of speculation on agricultural commodities. The total volume of products
Investment currently offered to individuals and related to derivatives of Contents
agricultural raw would be $ 3.725 billion to € 13. This quantitative estimate is probably
well short of reality, insofar as it does not take into account the investment fund
own and on behalf of third parties made by banks active in Belgium or transactions
carried out outside regulated markets. The lack of information disclosed by banks
in this area is particularly regrettable.
For Ecolo, it is crucial to adopt the European and Belgian levels of provisions to
strictly regulate the markets of commodities derivatives, so that they
return to their original function, namely to enable producers to sell their
goods with consumers and help producers and processors and
consumers or transformers (for example, agribusiness) to hedge against volatility
prices of raw materials.
As part of the revision of the Agreement of 14 January 2014 amending the Directive
the European Markets in Financial Instruments ("MiFID II"), Ecolo and European Greens
managed to include provisions to limit speculation in commodities. In
particular, the competent authorities will now have the power to limit the size of the position
net that can hold a single operator performing transactions on derivatives
raw materials (on organized markets or over the counter). In Belgium, considers Ecolo
at a minimum banks operating in the territory should be obliged to publish, in their
Annual report detailed data on all derivative materials
First they hold or where they promote the exchange.
Such transparency requirement would allow the Belgian supervisor more easily detect
speculative practices on raw materials and to take the necessary measures to be
end.

Proposal: Taxing financial transactions
It is widely recognized today that the introduction of a tax on financial transactions
(FTT) at the EU level would offer two advantages, namely:
additional income which according to the parameters adopted, would amount between 50 and
190 billion to €;
12
13

As has highlighted the UN Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Olivier De Schutter.
According to estimates from a study commissioned by the Alternative Financing Network (RFA) and dated March 2013.

Ecolo program 2014 - Social Justice Book - Chapter REGULATION BANKING AND FINANCE - p 13/15

financial regulation, to the extent that an FTT would help discourage speculative allersretours, without discouraging the long detention of securities, the
management of financial assets in "good father" or investment in the economy
"Real".
In the absence of a pan-European support for a tax on financial transactions (FTT)
a group of eleven EU Member States (including Belgium) decided to go ahead by
enhanced cooperation procedure, based on a draft Commission directive
European. This provides for an 0.1% tax on stock exchange transactions and
bonds and 0.01% for transactions on derivatives.
Launched in February 2013, negotiations between the eleven participating Member States have set
light the will of some to weaken the original proposal from the Commission,
requiring backstage exceptions which, taken together, are transforming into an instrument TTF
no regulatory effect and generating extremely low income. This attitude is quite
unacceptable.
For Ecolo, an ambitious and effective FTT must necessarily be based on the following principles:
the principle of issue, which requires financial institutions located outside the EU
pay a tax if the securities are issued within the EU or in countries involved in the
enhanced cooperation;
the residence principle, according to which all financial transactions in the EU or in
States involved in enhanced cooperation are taxed;
taxation of each transaction (including canceled orders), so as to limit the
high frequency trading;
taxation of sellers and buyers;
the taxation of derivatives by the nominal value covered by the product and not
depending on the price of the product itself;
the application of a higher rate for risky transactions "over the counter" (less
controlled and transparent than stock market instruments);
the obligation to condition the legality of the transfer of ownership of a security in satisfaction
prior to the tax;
Finally, the establishment of a broad scope of the FTT, including not only
stocks, bonds, derivatives, but also transactions on
currencies.

Economic redeployment
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND
COMMUNICATION
Deploy a society of creation,
cooperation and social participation
Status and political horizon
State of play
The "information society" is materialized daily via computers, tablets, televisions,
radios, via electronic media, social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram ...), GSM and
other websites. Behind the use of these technological instruments poses a series of
questions and issues related to their use and their impact on our daily lives.
ICT enormous potential to tag
It is clear that information and communications technology (ICT) is bearing
an infinite creative and participatory potential: creating content, interactivity, global trade
access to information and cultural content are fabulous emancipation levers
Social and freedom of expression. However, they are also carriers of inequality and dangers
require democratic regulation.
Indeed, on the one hand, such fundamental principles as the right to privacy, freedom
of expression, the right to learn and access to knowledge, the right to assemble or
yet the right of consumers are involved in the virtual world. On the other hand, the
daily, whether at school, in our dealings with the administration or with
banking institutions, ICT show deep inequalities: inequalities
access, inequalities in the risk assessment power they generate or
socio-economic inequalities.
Digital divide and literacy
The barometer ICT 2013 Walloon Telecommunications Agency (AWT) 1 reveals that 78%
Walloon households own a computer and 77% of them are connected to the Internet.
Regarding the Brussels-Capital Region, the numbers are almost similar with 21% of
homes still do not have a computer and a quarter of Brussels does not have a
Internet2 connection.
Beyond the problem of the digital divide and "excluded ICT" also arises
the issue of digital literacy, since 82% of respondents believe that ICT must
be mastered in elementary or high school and 95% of the Walloons are in favor
Children's information by the school about the dangers of the web and the protection of their data
personal. Such "expertise" is all the more important in view of the exhibition

growing our privacy on social networks. The Scherms case, Austrian student
requesting to know all the data stored about him, is only a
illustration: following his request, he received more than 1200 pages of data. This reflects the fact that
some companies retain all the data entered or generated by a user,
even those that the user has "erased".
Private life
Besides issues related to social networks, the notion of privacy has two other
set cause3. On one hand, it faces a further reduction of its scope under the influence
of security requirements, which requires finding a balance between the concepts of lost
security and freedom. One of the most emblematic examples is certainly the case
Snowden4. On the other hand, the share given to new technologies in everyday life can
to privacy with evil ICT can thus be intrusive, or by geolocation
the use of biometrics for example.

The political horizon of Ecolo for information technology and
communication
Given these facts, Ecolo intends to ensure the conditions of a successful information society
Democratic ensuring access and participation of everyone, especially via
digital public spaces, as well as accompanying development of a legislative framework
adapted to ensure the protection of fundamental rights.
ICT must be carriers of a progressive and fair model of technological development.
To this end, it is essential that:
All and all enjoy equal access to new technologies as
materially and in their use;
Each user and track user guarantee the protection of his privacy and that he
is not subject to increased surveillance when he surfs the Internet or communicate by
electronically;
Every citizen and Information Research citizen can have access to a free stock
and plural information, without the information source is unique nor padlocked by
some private firms;
Each user and user of ICT is protected and free in its choice of media
hardware and software.
In this context, Ecolo defends free software, because the stakes very far beyond that of
equipping computers: defending free software implies defending a project
company that echoes the social and environmental changes have always worn by
environmentalists. Indeed, the "free movement" is intended to fight against the appropriation of
information, knowledge and technological developments by preventing some
facto equal and equitable access to information and technology innovations, yet access
the digital economy engine. Free software is also carriers of social values
fundamental as they promote both empowerment, creation and collaboration to face
competitive and closed model of proprietary software. The possibility offered to everyone
using, mastering and re-appropriate technologies used almost daily
matches Ecolo emancipatory project for the promotion of individual freedoms.

The Ecolo force lines to implement its project on technologies
information and communication are the following:

Adopt a universal declaration of the rights of Internet users
Put ICT at the service of citizens and a project ever more democratic society
and more transparent
Develop another approach details: the global license
Ensuring sustainable technological development

Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: ENSURING potection UNIVERSAL HUMAN RIGHTS INTERNET
Belgium and the European Union must guarantee the rights of citizens in both the
real life as in the 'virtual' life through a Charter or Declaration. Respond to changes
technological, and it should reaffirm the fundamental rights as guaranteed a
universal access to ICTs, the right to privacy, the provision of free information and
plural and the right to security on the canvas.

Proposal: To ensure equality with new technologies
The questions brought by ICT to traditional conceptions of democracy are the
strengthen and not weaken it. This is particularly important for e-democracy should be
inclusive, which means to abolish the digital divide. It is therefore necessary to overcome the disparities
in access to ICTs.
In 2009, one in four young was still not connecté5 which is not without consequences
schooling and future socio-economic inequalities (access to search engines,
job search, ability to use word processing programs, etc.). The notion of
digital divide should not be conceived in terms of access to computers
(computer, Internet, mobile telephony ...), it's also in terms of use need
consider it. It should fight against digital illiteracy, starting with the youngest
generations.
Indeed, the young public is increasingly sought primarily by social networks,
revealing a number of personal data on the web. However, the data thus made
available on the Internet do not disappear. There are a number of criteria
Privacy and uses of Internet functions to be taught, for example in
Digital Public Spaces (EPN) and as part of the school curriculum.
To this end, Ecolo offers:
Ensuring fast internet and mobile telephony for all by including it in the service
universal European (as well as the postal service or access to electricity) and support
further access to materials and reduced-price connection because their costs
remain much higher in Belgium than in the rest of the European Union;
Building a true European telecoms market by eliminating eventual costs
associated with "roaming";
Politically and financially strengthen the role of Digital Public Spaces (EPN)

supporting innovative policies of the EPN and strengthen their staff in their role

framing. Within them permanent ICT training should be delivered to
destination economically fragile people, youth and seniors;
Integrating media literacy and critical sources of information in curricula
School including through partnerships with Public Spaces numériques6;
Significantly improve the hardware maintenance in these
institutions and ensure transition to free software media software
increase durability and reduce the cost for facilities. Pooling
resources between schools of the same basin should be considered so that they have
technical staff whose job would be to maintain the software and hardware support
IT, develop multimedia spaces ...;
Develop training for young people and teachers to the wise use of
new technological tools in order that ICTs bring real added value
educational;
Support the spread of free software in order to break the divide between software
Owners and free software. It is not normal at present a person
using free software can have equal access to information encoded in a
proprietary software;
Guarantee persons with disabilities equal access to the virtual world
Currently, a label is in place, Easysurfer for sites accessible to
persons with disabilities, and following the recommendations of the World Wide
Web Consortium (W3C). But this is not enough. The accessibility of the sites should be
gradually generalized, starting with public sites (administrations, etc.) 7.

Proposal: Protecting the digital identity and ensure the right to privacy
New technologies are installed in many areas of daily life:
finding information, banking, online shopping, booking of all types,
exchanges between friends (emails, social networks ...) or the government (taxes, VAT ...).
In this context, personal information is becoming more easily disseminated and
accessible to others. While the use of these devices is spreading rapidly, questions
Ethical raised by these devices have to date, in our country, been no real
social debate. It is urgent to fill this gap so that democratic society
information does not turn into restriction privacy tool. Ecolo wants to wear a wide
debate in the Federal Parliament, with the actors of civil society, on the use of
personal data by ICT.
To ensure the primacy of individual and collective freedoms in the context of the new
information and communications technology (ICT), Ecolo also proposes to:
Guarantee everyone the right to protect digital identity and that through a series of
measures:

6
7
8

-

Adopt a legal framework to punish identity theft on the Internet,
If use of the name, including that of associations, institutions or
organizations, or other identifiers such as nickname, pseudonym, address
electronics, IP address, in order to cause harm to the individual for whom
the usurper pretends. Particular attention should be paid to the fact that
this provision does not penalize pastiche and / or parodie8;

-

For the sake of consistency, the fact to collect identification elements
illegitimately must be incriminated;

See Chapter "Disability".
For more on this, see Chapter "Culture and Media".

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter Information Technologies and Communication - p 4/12

-

The creation of a "right to digital oblivion" to help citizens
better manage the risks associated with the protection of data online. Every person
has indeed the right to modify or delete data concerning
especially when:
these data are incomplete or irrelevant given the goal of
treatment ;
these data are no longer needed for the purpose of the contract
authorizing the processing of data;
these data are not essential to the pursuit of service for which
they were stored;
the person breaks the contract which permits the treatment of
data ;
the retention period authorized or approved by mutual consent
expired ;
treatment is no longer lawful.
Furthermore, by court order, search engines should be able to
Staff censor content if it violates one way or
another to the person concerned.

-

Or require the person responsible for data processing to communicate
original data source. This information is necessary for
allow the person who wants to change or delete data on the
go back to the holder of the original file and avoid dilution
responsibilities between the different processing managers.

Ensure a high level of protection of personal data:
-

Attending, at European level, proactive development of a framework
Legal which is in view to the preservation of the right to privacy and
not in a logic of free movement of personal data
as is currently the case;

-

Limit and control the use of such data by private firms as well as by
authorities ;

-

Fighting agreements between private companies that cross the data
personal at their disposal to do marketing profiling;

-

Submit any draft legislation likely to touch on this aspect, to notice
binding of the Commission on Privacy;

-

Grant the Commission a right of privacy control and sanction firms
private and government which violate fundamental principles inherent to life
private or not taking sufficient measures to ensure a high level
protection of personal data they process;

-

Ensure that the Commission on Privacy benefits of human,
technological and financial resources to carry out the tasks it
entrusted;

-

Taking into account the respect for privacy from the design of programs
IT (Privacy by Design9) and generalizing assessments relating to
privacy (Privacy Impact Assessments10);

9
Privacy By Design (taking into account the respect for privacy from the design) is an approach developed by the
Commissioner for the Protection of Privacy in Ontario, which encourages the production and operation of systems
minimize the collection, storage, processing and storage of personal data. It uses

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter Information Technologies and Communication - p 5/12

-

Disseminate and make them readable user agreements, the possibilities of control and
parameters to best manage the confidentiality of data
personal. Indeed, Internet browsers such as social networking
offer features for managing information exchanged on sites
Internet (as blocking cookies) or detailed options for managing the
better dissemination of data of its Internet profile. In an empowerment concern
user and because these parameters are rarely changed, it should be
making these tools accessible to non-technical users to optimize their
use. In this perspective, it would impose a legal standard for
terms of use and privacy settings for networks
Social at European level;

-

Create a European label to protect privacy. This would impose
public authorities to promote their computer exchanges
(supply data, computer systems ...) with firms
labeled.

Proposal: Ensure the right to a free and pluralist information openness and
net neutrality
The opening of the network is a societal choice, as an open network is a network where the
Internet users have a wide freedom to use, modify and disseminate information. Conversely, a
closed network that allows users to perform actions permitted by officials
("Gatekeepers") who have control over the information.
Net neutrality is defined as the principle that all information is
conveyed without discrimination on networks. This principle must prevent an operator locks,
slowing or interfering with the exchange of information on the network or, conversely, in prioritizes
others, such as through the delivery of some content partners. But since
few years, this principle has been questioned, particularly under the influence of the increasing
traffic and development purposes - legal and illegal - that have led some operators
but also some copyright owners to defend practices that go against
the neutrality.
It is therefore necessary for Ecolo, support:
The establishment of a European and Belgian legislation guaranteeing net neutrality
while respecting certain balances such as the preservation of fundamental freedoms
(including singles), maintaining public order or national security, and
obligations which the authorities may impose on operators as such (blocking, filtering,
etc.). Exceptions are permitted but the exclusive initiative of the government and
must meet certain requirements: relevance, effectiveness, proportionality
transparency, non-discrimination actors;
The ban on deep packet inspection (analysis of the content of a network packet) 11, except
under exceptions provided by law, to avoid Internet censorship by
example ;
The creation of a European public search engine algorithm which would be the most
open and transparent as possible;

Assessments of privacy throughout the life cycle of a system, from initial design, when
upgrades, and until his retirement. To be effective, this method must have the support frames
leaders.
10
The Impact Assessments to privacy (Privacy Impact Assessments - PIA) are now mandatory on
Many jurisdictions, including the United States, and require government agencies to draw up an assessment
Risk of new privacy policies before systems are put into service.
11
DPI is content analysis of network packet to derive statistics, filter or identify intrusions,
spam or other defined content. It can therefore serve as Internet censorship.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter Information Technologies and Communication - p 6/12

A policy of investment in research and development at European level to
increase capacity of bandwidth but more generally to cope with the
structural weakness of the European Union in terms of IT production (both
software and material);
A Servers creation program Racine (primary domain name servers
System, DNS) European. Indeed, for the moment, there are only 13 primary servers with
10 are located in the US, 2 in Europe and 1 in Japan. This represents a US monopoly
threat to the neutrality of the European Web.

Proposal: To ensure the right to Internet security: fight against
Cybercrime
The development of the digital space is certainly the most important revolution of these
last fifty years. But this development was accompanied by dangers that no one can
ignore: the false computer, Internet fraud, manipulation of data,
"Hackings" the distribution of violent content, racist, sexist or child pornography ... The
intangible nature of the network makes these offenses very visible when they have real consequences
and instantaneous.
Faced with this reality, Ecolo wants to strengthen the human, financial and technological capacity to
effective fight against cybercrime in all its aspects and at all levels: Centre
for Belgian Cybercrime, European Centre for the fight against cybercrime (EC3) and
international. The fight against cybercrime must be done in a Belgian and European context
respect for fundamental freedoms. As such, Ecolo defends a control program which takes
the following characteristics:
the systematic use of free software in order to free themselves from the grip of Companies
IT;
the use of hardwares and softwares which place neither Belgium nor the Union
European in a relationship of dependency vis-à-vis computer companies
American or Asian;
the refusal of a logic of "Big data" which aims to collect mass data
then establish profiles either safe or commercial.
Ecolo wants to defend a targeted and proportionate approach in the fight against
Cybercrime in order to find the right balance between "security" paradigm and "respect for
fundamental rights ".

PRIORITY 2: TO ICT FOR CITIZENS AND PROJECT
COMPANY EVER MORE DEMOCRATIC AND MORE TRANSPARENT

Proposal: Develop cyberdemocracy
E-democracy is a concept based on using ICT to improve the process
democratic. ICT should allow citizens with a voice to debate
and follow the action from their elected representatives. Cyberdemocracy must also be an opportunity to ensure
transparency of political activity.
Ecolo offers include:
To ensure good availability of all political data, including
budget, in open formats and thus develop a real democracy

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter Information Technologies and Communication - p 7/12

monitoring as this is already happening on sites like www.droitderegard.be,
www.votewatch.eu or www.alter-eu.org;
To ensure the retransmission of elected assemblies to improve access to debates
policies and better identify each of positions;
To set up sites to gather citizens' initiatives at different levels
to be able to ;
Establish Internet platforms for dialogue between citizens and
authorities ;
To make possible the use of new information technologies and
Communication in implementing the right of petition;
To open sections in the websites of political groups in different
meetings to promote a bottom-up democracy and to encourage participation
citizen.
The OpenData
Regarding OpenData, any public entity collects, generates and stores data
Electronic (databases, maps, electronic records, etc.). They
also an intangible heritage which, subject to conditions, can be made
community service while respecting privacy:
citizens and journalists can find there the raw information;
researchers can find there information to underpin their work and
research ;
Developers and IT professionals can find it for raw materials
innovative services;
companies can provide these data add value, and thus participate in the
revitalization of the territory in which they are established.
To this end, and taking all precautions regarding personal data protection
or the best interests of society, Ecolo offers:
promote measures to free and available in open formats, electronic data
produced by public authorities, provided that this does not affect door
the general interest or to the performance of public12 service missions;
encourage, moreover, the public authorities to make available data
the most readable way possible in order to facilitate both the understanding that
treatment with citizens of such data;
to reflect on the possibility of making pay the reuse of certain
data for commercial purposes;
create, ultimately, a free européen13 information system to interconnect the various
national information systems which are based on the collection, treatment and
dissemination. This information system would allow a real pooling
information resources and would give rise to substantial economies of scale. he
participate, more broadly, to the creation of a stronger digital Europe, more
open and efficient.

12
Public documents of all levels of government (municipal Councils at Federal), legal texts, some
executive decisions, some studies for governments, some data on services
public citizens.
13
An information system (IS) is a set of resources that allows the collection, processing and dissemination of
data in a specific context.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter Information Technologies and Communication - p 8/12

Proposal: Promote the use of free software
Ecolo intends to support open source software face the powerful private firms developing
proprietary software and padlocking drives and citizens.
Specifically, Ecolo offers:
Systematize the use of free software in the public field (public authorities,
administrations, schools ...) and the use of open file formats to ensure the
better interoperability in information transfers;
Encourage free software, technical language and a traffic open data:
anyone should be able to participate in building an information society without
having to pay royalties or reinvent a language to communicate with others
information system ;
Allow each and everyone to choose or develop its own software tools;
Ecolo wants to strengthen the fight at European level against the automatic presence
software and operating systems imposed by hardware manufacturers
and ensure interoperability of software in the operating systems
applying stricter provisions to fight against practices
unfair trade. This last mission will be entrusted to the European Committee
standards which serve as a liaison to businesses and companies working in the
ICT;
Encourage the use of computer software using open standards, in
order to ensure the interoperability of systems, secure digital archiving and
secure electronic access over the long term digital contents even if the software
that generated them is no longer available. Furthermore, the use of open standards
can not impose the choice of a particular software.

PRIORITY 3: DEVELOPING A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO DOWNLOAD: LA
GLOBAL LICENSE
Internet has become a gigantic "multimedia library". With the generalization of
Internet broadband connections, the download of cultural goods protected by the rights
author has completely commonplace, especially among the young. We assist by
Besides a new revolution with the galloping digitization of books.
Artists, authors, producers, publishers, performers and companies that manage their rights see
radically transform their business. The physical cultural media (CDs, LPs, DVDs, etc.)
disappears but not the digital economy has made the Internet the major vector distribution
cultural property.
In countries such as France and Sweden, it was decided to introduce a control technique
Internet traffic in order to punish illegal downloading told (HADOPI). It turns out that its implementation
technical and policy work is cons-productive. Indeed, the cost of control of Internet
made necessary by law is problematic beyond the issues raised by damage
privacy of citizens. Moreover, HADOPI is unlikely to allow a transfer of
download patterns to said platforms legal download, and so the payout
owner of copyright.
To address these issues, Ecolo does not support this repressive logic and
ineffective and proposes to introduce a "global license". This is a small contribution and
progressive Internet service providers, accompanied by a price freeze,
automatically included in each monthly subscription to the Internet on the model of the
contribution paid by cable companies. The amount of global licenses would be determined

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter Information Technologies and Communication - p 9/12

annually by the government, after negotiations between the rights management companies
copyright and Internet providers. This license aims both to be recorded that the canvas
has become a major distributor of cultural products and services, while reaffirming the right
for cultural actors to maintain control of the works they create.

PRIORITY 4: ENSURE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT TECHNOLOGY
Proposal: Ending planned obsolescence as software that
Hardware
It is essential to promote the quality and sustainability as software that hardware, so
simplify the consumer's life and reduce the ecological footprint of ICTs. Indeed,
Currently, a smartphone is obsoleted after - maximum - three years while, too
Often the hardware update is only used to force the consumer to buy a new
product without necessarily behave in real innovation.
It is the same in the world of software. In fact, updates of increasingly regular
software will soon become a nightmare for users. Sometimes the consumer
receives a partial software donning Computer problems, which improves as and when
Update. Ecolo believes that consumers must receive a finished product, unless it has
downloaded a product labeled clearly as "beta." 14
For a list of goods that pose the most problems (hardware, televisions, etc.),
producing companies should be encouraged to agree on a collective agreement of the consumer
pledging to publish information on how to repair or recycle products in an
reasonable time. Thus, manufacturers and sellers must:
view lifetime or use of the products, and the possible presence of
blockers meters;
a general obligation to ensure both hardware and software reliability;
provide free consumers the means to circumvent such a bridle
product by providing an explanatory proceedings or by ensuring that none of
access to components is blocked, for example;
availability of spare parts and file maintenance manuals and repair in
a database within a maximum period of two years after the placing on the market.
Manufacturers are responsible for the distribution of these manuals.
Without satisfactory agreement, Ecolo proposed that the government take action through legislation. The
producers could be made responsible for the waste processing downstream of the
consumption, to encourage them to promote the sustainability of their products, eco-design and
repair.

Proposal: Ensure technological development friendly
the environment
ICT has long been presented as an important source of energy savings since
saves from 1 to 4 times their own emissions of greenhouse gases. Indeed,
"Smart 2020" which is the main global study establishes a potential savings of 7800
million tons of CO² through ICT by 2020.

14

This is a second period of life of a computer product before its finalization and trade development. During
this period, users are "beta testers".

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter Information Technologies and Communication - p 10/12

Nevertheless, their environmental impact has recently become a préoccupation15. Indeed, the
increasing share of ICT-related power consumption in households, difficulties
and increasing the costs associated with the power supply of data centers increasingly
energy consuming, producing toxic waste volumes, the massive use of rare earths
in electronic components, made emerge a major environmental issue.
The need for global thinking in terms of environmental impacts now appears more
obvious. That is why environmentalists argue for:
Strengthening the share of ICT in European reflections related Package
"Energy-Climate", because these are currently very few considered,
with the exception of a few particulars relating to standby equipment;
Implementation of design and production process to achieve
energy savings, a high level of energy efficiency and reduced gas
greenhouse effect. It is indeed necessary that the R & D16 in connection with the ICT sector
focuses on recyclable technologies, cleaner and therefore more economical in
terms of resources;
That special attention be paid to the sustainability of farms server with
the advent of "cloud17" become ubiquitous and energy intensive
so as to feed to cool the system.

TOURISM
Sustainable tourism for the benefit of everyone
Status and political horizon
State of play
Tourism are tourist trips down the world1 or a few kilometers from home
itself, recreation, relaxation or business trips. This is an area which remains even
in a context of economic crisis, expanding globally. Note though:
starting rate on holiday in some European countries has stagnated or even regressed so sometimes
important.
Globally, it represents the first post of international trade, employment twelve
globally, one tenth of gross world product, a third of service exports
(45% for developing countries). Over the last six decades, its growth rate
annual average exceeds 5% 2.
Tourism affects also a set of policies and fields, its links with
cultural, social and environmental issues are important. The central role of the
tourism to growth and employment has many implications for other areas
of public policy: social policy, inclusion ('tourism for all'), diversification
of rural economies, maritime policy, mobility, sustainability and competitiveness.
On the scale of Europe, tourism is dominated by the Mediterranean Area, which brings together alone
nearly 40% of European tourism. On the rest of the country, the nights are so arranged
more or less homogeneous. Germany, France and the UK, which are the three major
source markets (state residents who go abroad) are responsible for over 40%
overnight stays.
On the scale of Belgium, our regions have many strengths in tourism. The
network of "bullet train" sets Belgium centrally in Europe and allows
fast and reliable connections to London, Paris, Amsterdam and Germany. The wealth
and historical heritage of our regions (folklore, UNESCO sights, castles, museums, gardens,
parks ...) also places them among the best.
In Wallonia, more than half of overnight stays are of Belgian origin. Then come
Dutch totaling 23% of overnight stays. Tourism Wallonia is primarily a tourist
domestic (state residents who travel in their country) or from neighboring regions. In
terms of employment, the tourism sector in Wallonia accounts for 5% of GDP and 60,000 jobs
direct and indirects3.
In the Brussels region, 80% of booked nights are of foreign origin. The top ranking
visitors held by France (13%), followed by Great Britain (8.1%), Spain
(7.6%), Germany (7%) and US (5.9%). Stays share to almost share

field between leisure tourism (46.9%) and business tourism (53.1%) 4. Finally, the sector
Brussels tourism represents about 15% of GDP and more than 35 000 direct jobs.
Faced with the growth of tourist exchanges, other figures worth pointing: only
3-5% of the world population can travel beyond the borders of his country. In Europe,
behavior of the inhabitants have evolved in the starting material in a crisis context
holiday, only a small majority of Europeans (around 55%) will be able to go on holiday
in 20135.

Sustainable and accessible tourism as a political horizon
For Ecolo, the leisure and business tourism offer, in varying degrees, many
opportunities for economic development and sustainable tourism in our regions. Furthermore,
the tourist offer of the Walloon and Brussels Regions can not develop long-term if the
people of our regions are involved and can benefit from its development.
Accessible Tourism
Tourism is inclusion and relaxation factor. For Ecolo, everyone must therefore be
enjoy relaxation and vacation stays. Regardless of age, income, difficulties in
move ... service quality and accessibility of places and tourist stays (at night
in an accommodation, booking a ticket) must be guaranteed.
Sustainable tourism
The tourist development for the benefit of local economic activity, employment,
environmental and cultural enrichment of people and involves visitors to minimize
negative impacts on the territory. Indeed, in the South, for example, a tourist uses
an average of 7 to 10 times more water than local people. For 2020, the World Organization of
Tourism (UNWTO) expects 1.5 billion tourists in the world, against 800 million in 2005.
cities should be the main beneficiaries of this development. These incremental changes do
are obviously not without impacts on greenhouse gas emissions linked to other
travel, or the depletion of resources and the natural heritage, notably due to
little responsible tourism.
Moreover, access to attractions and sights as well as energy efficiency and
Environmental host buildings, modes of travel and accommodation
should be reflected, in order to limit the impact of holidays and tourism activities. This requires
a regional policy coordination and participation of all stakeholders
concerned, both in the production of goods as tourist services themselves.
A redeployment of tourism as vector
Finally, tourism is also an important non-relocatable jobs in tank
host functions, organization, guidance, transportation, new technologies,
marketing, the use of languages, training, construction and renovation,
Horeca, etc. In addition to direct employment, many people derive income benefit
Additional related to rental houses, to guide visitors to the Horeca. For Ecolo, it is
essential to support this growing economic sector.

The falls are severe in Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal and also very real in Great Britain,
France, and the starting rate in many countries of Eastern Europe is still low, although it has not had an equal stall

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter TOURISM - p 2/11

Ecolo force lines in sustainable tourism
To develop a tourism that respects the environment and people, people
and local workers, Ecolo door the following priorities:
Promote sustainable tourism
Ensure accessibility of everyone to places and tourist stays
Valuing regions as tourist attractions quality
Continue the professionalization of the sector by giving it greater consistency

PRIORITY 1: PROMOTING TOURISM SUSTAINABLE
The role of tourism in the economy is often perceived as limited to one sector of cafes,
hotels and restaurants as well as travel agencies and airlines, which are in
many countries the first service sector. However, the economic impact of the sector
tourism is much more important, to the extent that the production of tourism services
leisure and requires many "inputs" that concern the entire production of both
agriculture and industry (including the production of capital goods), the building sector,
telecommunications and public works.
Faced with globalization, Ecolo promotes local economic development. Create a web
near economic, sustainable and not be relocated that meets the needs of
citizens, to limit the social and environmental costs and create quality jobs. The
sustainable tourism is an economic redeployment lever and attractiveness of our regions.
Sustainable tourism is part of a dynamic that articulates the modes of travel,
production and consumption, while closely associating the development project
tourism and socio-economic benefits the people living, working or staying
in the area concerned. This development requires a planning and integrated management of
resources, mastery of flows (energy, goods and people). This also implies the
close involvement of local actors and responsibility of the tourists to reconcile the setting
implement tourism with the needs and reception capacities of the territory.
In addition, tourism is an opportunity for meetings, openness to others, Discovery
what makes the heart of our culture, our land and our identities. Tourism is the most
great "Keeping Peace Industry" (peace industry) in the world. Furthermore, having the leisure to
move within the European territory also contributes to developing European citizenship,
by the discovery of other cultures of Europe and the meeting with its inhabitants. In this regard, the
tourism can help to forge the European identity and be a vector of peace.

Proposal: To promote local tourism and proximity
Often the inhabitants of a region or city spend only a short time to
discover the riches that surround them. So if you know the name or the main view
tourist attractions, we do not always take the trouble to visit them. And beyond
"Unavoidable", all activities outside the beaten tourist track are often
unknown, or our regions are rich in Nearby tours that benefit from being (re) known.
Ecolo therefore proposes to focus on local tourist attractions and activities
regional and promote them among the citizens, through the discovery tools
tangible and intangible heritage, culture of our towns and villages, their artists,
local products to revitalize local tourism.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter TOURISM - p 3/11

Ecolo also wants to support alternative tourism initiatives that offer a look
different on a city, a neighborhood, a village. More and more organizations propose to discover
history and the industrial, economic, social, city or a neighborhood. These approaches
include the ability to promote places forgotten or distant tourist spots.

Proposal: To develop a participatory tourism
The participatory tourism involves the host population to tourism activities that are
proposed within its territory. It is a way to reinvent hospitality.
To this end, Ecolo offers:
Developing networks of greeters6: people passionate about their neighborhood, their village,
their town or region who share their knowledge over time of a visit;
Pursue and encourage the development of the homestay while
ensuring that this does not come at the expense of accommodation: guest rooms,
Camping homestay, promotion of alternative accommodation (couchsurfing7 ...);
Support structures that develop plans and tours in collaboration with
residents, such as USE-IT8.

Proposal: Promote slow tourism
This is a new travel concept inspired by the slow food movement encouraging
people to rediscover the pleasures of the table, against the tide of junk food and fast food. There
slow tourism philosophy is to take the time to discover a destination and people
living there to enjoy the scenery, to give time, focusing particularly
close destinations and means of cleaner transport. This type of tourism allows
live closer to the local people and learn about it. The slow tourism
develops in parallel mass tourism. The goal is to absorb as much as possible of the place
that we visit, avoiding walkabouts, and choosing less borrowed circuits. In
Accordingly, Ecolo offers:
Developing the rail as the backbone of international sustainable mobility offer,
national, regional and métropolitaine9;
Focus on river tourism through promotion currently entrusted to the Directorate
Promotion of Waterways and Intermodal within the SPW;
Develop shared bicycle networks in all major cities and Walloon
continue improving and enhancing the supply and quality of service in Region
Brussels (improved performance bicycles, electric bicycle passage ...) 10;
Encourage and promote the attractions and activities "slow11" via
publication of books and the creation of a label containing the locations of establishments,
activities, accommodation, catering, etc. ;
Developing host mobility packages "all in one" promotes soft mobility and
public transport (including trains map free-tram-bus-bicycle for
24h ...);

Accentuate the development of a cycling network (Ravel and green way linking)
connected to that of the neighboring regions and the Euro-Bike system, based on
existing hosting infrastructure or raise and a transport network
welcoming common bicycles. This project will help guide this type of tourism
emerging towards our regions.
Wallonia:
Finalize the layout diagram of reception areas for Motor Homes to promote
quality hospitality.

Proposal: To encourage environmentally friendly actions
Ecolo offers:
Encourage and generalize the environmental labeling programs in the
accommodation sector, convention halls and tourist attractions, including
campsites and places of welcome for motorhome ... (verte12 Key, Emas13 ...) that provide
preserving the environment and encourage environmentally friendly practices in the sector
tourism. Eco-labels are one of the benchmarks to measure
the concrete commitment of tourist actors a destination for
sustainability ;
Initiate collective approaches integrating advocacy,
support (technical, financial) or even promotion for wear and
develop the registration process of a region and / or city in tourism
sustainable. As illustrated européenne14 a comparison, the most advanced destinations
in this respect are those who initiated such proceedings;
Include in the search criteria offered by information and power plants
Booking the principles of sustainable development;
Strengthen the business segment of sustainable tourism. If this aspect does not prevail in the
choice of location, the clientele is increasingly integrating a plaintiff benefits
sustainable development approach. The great receptive facilities therefore have an interest in
rely on eco-certified providers / ecolabelled (technical service providers,
transport, accommodation ...) 15;
Providing regional administrations in charge of tourism a real cell
"Sustainable tourism" at Tourism Flanders image;
Systematize the presence of social and environmental clauses in the terms of
control costs of infrastructure financed by public tools;
Ensure secure decent status to industry workers, including
Seasonal and volunteers;
Promote short circuits, local products, local and Food
durable in Horeca16;
Implement incentives for energy efficiency in the accommodation sector,

Valuing pilot projects including the creation of "Awards" of sustainable tourism.
Specifically Wallonia:
Reorient site development "the Lakes of Eau d'Heure" to copy Site

Evaluate and possibly redefine tourist areas by enabling
better distribution of tourist flows on regional territories. Initially a
Inventory recreation areas available and / or provide and analysis of flows,
to suggest the development of new or old resort areas (new

PRIORITY 2: GUARANTEE FOR ALL AND ALL THE ACCESSIBILITY OF STAYS
TOURIST
Stakeholder in the social and solidarity economy, tourism allows social17 job creation
permanent. It contributes to local and economic development of regions, including
generating flow of people and investment.
Travel, travel for pleasure a place other than where they usually live, must be a
activity accessible to all. The access to holidays has an impact on the recognized quality of life
and well being. Trips contribute to the openness to other cultures, to discoveries,
leisure ... But between the "right" to holidays and the legal existence of annual leave on one hand, and
ability to actually go on vacation the other hand, there is too often a ditch
fill in most of the country ... In fact, the holiday topped expenses
deleted by those in précaire18 situation. Furthermore, social tourism suffers
Currently a picture associated with a popular tourism first perceived as an activity to
discount for the "people", while by his ambition to democratization of tourism,
social tourism contributes to the fight against inequality and against exclusion and promotes cohesion
social.
Specifically, Ecolo offers:
To establish a pass "leisure" drawing on good foreign practices (programs

accessibility to holidays and tourist attractions for people
disadvantaged;
Reposition social tourism as a tourism open to all, allowing
especially the most disadvantaged people to access the right to holidays (youth,
families, the disabled, single parents, unemployed, seniors with low pensions ...).
To strengthen the image and the promotion of social tourism:

PRIORITY 3: ENHANCING THE REGIONS AS POLES OF TOURISM
QUALITY

Proposal: Promoting regional identity, internationally recognized
Our Regions reflect a cultural, artistic, gastronomic should be strong
value. To name a few examples: the surrealism of Delvaux and Magritte; the
Queen Elisabeth Competition, or the many electronic music festivals; comics
with Hergé, Franquin, Peyo, etc. ; gastronomy and Belgian beers; folklore, and ducasses
carnivals.
For Ecolo, we must unite the tourist offers around strong and complementary identities of our
Regions.
Wallonia:
Enhance the green image and rural tourism in Wallonia: activities "nature" products
land, and intangible cultural heritage, tourism ... in the forest;
Develop a clear and targeted offers short stays tourism in cities
Walloon: art cities and industrial history including (Tournai, Enghien, Mons,
Charleroi, La Louvière, Waterloo, Dinant, Namur, Arlon, Marche, Huy, Liège ...).
In the Brussels Region:
Mark the image of the Brussels Region as a region of history and art, culture,
events and festivals: comics, art nouveau, beer, European capital,
gastronomy … ;
Valuing durable27 city image;
Promoting the image of Brussels as the capital of Europe, international city, seat
many institutions.

Proposal: To promote our towns and villages local to international
It is essential to work together various public tools responsible for the representation
Foreign Belgian regional destinations. Cooperation agreements are needed to
give the greatest possible consistency in our representation in foreign markets.
Wallonia:
Develop a "tourist image" of Wallonia suitable for positioning on sites,
in private tourist guides and to include it in the circuits of tour operators. This
passes through:

27

-

the creation of a package "discovery of Walloon cities";

-

the development of flagship products: natural parks, hiking, attractions
"Nature" target "10 essential nature";

-

promoting sustainable image through products labeled "Green Key";

-

a policy of promotional paper and virtual editions. For more than 5
years, Wallonia is privately promotional guides and disadvantaging
lowest tourist operators (small hotels, lodges and elderly homeowners
of guesthouses, small campsites ...);

Brussels was one of four finalists for the European Award "Green Capital" in 2015 but was not selected.

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter TOURISM - p 8/11

-

quality translations in several languages ​​made the guides;

-

annual events like "tourist Awards' theme;

-

enhancement of tourist attractions in the parks, on the part of the model
General developed for forests, which encourages a new offer
based wealth of biodiversity;

-

finalize and ensure the updating of the portal "Tourism Wallonia" referencing all
authorized operators (tourist attractions, hosting, circuit
hiking, official tourist organizations, travel agencies that sell
Wallonia, restaurants, parks ...);

-

support the continuation of an events policy through assistance
special promotion, the creation of a representative body and a
Annual valuation (assessment, symposium, awards, targeted analysis ...).

However, the promotion of Wallonia can not always be done independently. She must
able to rely on the radiation of the Brussels Region (reputation and image that
reinforcing) or on the reputation and identity of Belgium (including the most countries
away).
In the Brussels Region:
Continue the work done through the production of major international concern events
and to encourage better cooperation among all industry players gathered in
of VisitBrussels;
Developing cards (type Pass) combining transport and tourism activities aimed
offering sustainable development (housing, shops ...).
Finally, the pass offers Ecolo "leisure" can be used for development and promotion of
Products and Belgian sites.

PRIORITY 4: CONTINUING PROFESSIONALIZATION SECTOR IN HIM
GIVING MORE CONSISTENCY
The tourism sector has great potential for expansion in Belgium and has
many dynamic players. Still it is necessary that their actions are coordinated.
Like what the Brussels-Capital Region has been creating Visitbrussels it is necessary
that the Walloon Region makes a rationalization and consolidation of public and
private effort to concentrate.
Thus, the General Commission for Tourism (CGT), Wallonie-Bruxelles Tourisme (WBT), offices
Belgian Tourism Wallonia and Brussels abroad, tourism federations
provincial, the tourist offices, tourist offices and tourist offices
gain to consult and coordinate their actions to provide Wallonia a strong image
and to enable an effective and sustainable structuring of tourism products.
In addition, training, awareness and capacity of the sector skills including
sustainable development and tourism accessible to all, is a necessity.

Proposal: Continue the professionalization of the sector
In view of increased professionalization of the sector, offers Ecolo:
Enhance and strengthen the link with training courses tourism, Catering,
events and culture. The duration of courses, educational attainment, employment

Ecolo Programme 2014 - Economic Redeployment Book - Chapter TOURISM - p 9/11

languages, including continuing education must be strengthened. In addition, the
Sustainable development must be integrated into the curriculum of training;
Train and educate industry professionals to labeling schemes
Green Key environmental kind, Emas, etc., through training programs,
conferences, magazines and conferences.

Proposal: To contribute to greater coherence and simplification
For Eco should be:
Linking tourism policy with other regional and federal policies
such as those related to transport, foreign affairs (visa policy), the
Taxation and Economy (VAT), education and training and to encourage the
interdepartmental coordination (tourism, economy, spatial planning by
example) to ensure efficiency;
Within the framework of regionalization, tourism policy should be linked to the
various regional representations abroad (foreign trade, WBI, Relex image
Brussels and Wallonia ...).
At the European level :
Initiate and promote stronger cooperation between European Member States,
including developing a European domestic tourism for all;
Better identify the features and European funding that can support this
cooperation.
In the Brussels Region:
Go ahead with the issue of mutual recognition of tourist guides. Indeed, given
the exclusive competence of the Regions, a licensed guide in Flanders can only guide in
Wallonia or abroad, without an agreement ensuring reciprocity;
Within the framework of regionalization, give the region a regional administration
Tourism able to regulate the sector and to support its development;
Entrusting the competence of a single regional tourism minister, allowing the Region
to take his place in the regional concert in tourism and exercising
full jurisdiction in European policies.
Wallonia:
Create a new public entity in charge of structuring the tourism offering
taking inspiration from the Wallonia Visitbrussels model;
Streamline and optimize the official tourism institutions (by Tourist Houses
example).

ENERGY AND CLIMATE
The energy transition:
less, better and differently
Status and political horizon
State of play
Access to energy is the economic issue, social and environmental of this century.
Indeed, our society faces a challenge in energy five times: the fight against
Global warming caused by human activity, allowing everyone access
reasonable energy and reduce energy costs, control costs for
economic activities, avoid the dangers of nuclear power and prepare for the decrease
availability of conventional oil and gas.
To ensure peace, social equity, improving living conditions, health and
Environmental everyone, it is essential to simultaneously address these challenges, which are
intrinsically linked and require common solutions.
Numerous scenarios indicate possible paths to address these challenges1. All pass
by anticipatory strategies and the implementation of a broad range of measures
contact information, to support massive and profitable investments in efficiency
energy, renewable energy and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This
which also constitutes an opportunity for sustainable economic development.
These measures should help citizens to hold their energy2 bills
taking into account the available resources of each. They must also make choices
ecological cheaper. Economic actors should be supported in their efforts to
cost control and development of sectors with the energy transition. This vision
integrated economic, environmental and social issues of energy policy and
fight against climate change differs fundamentally ecologists
traditional approaches.
Finally, it is to avoid embarking on the race to find new sources of energy
would not be sustainable and that the operation would present major risks for
Environment and Health (deep subsea field operation in Arctic Region
oil sands, shale oil and gas).

Today it is estimated that just over 5% of Belgian citizens are in fuel poverty. Otherwise,
according to CREG end of 2012, the final electricity price to consumers rose by 30.49% compared to January 2007.
Also according to the CREG, the price of natural gas increased on average by 36% between 2007 and 2013. Regardless, the
Furnace oil prices more than doubled in 10 years. For a family that consumes 2000 liters per year, the price of
Oil rose from € 733 / year in 2003 to € 1,700 / year in 2013. The prices of traditional fossil fuels are not
ambiguity on the rise.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENERGY AND CLIMATE - p 1/27

Energy policy is a key priority of Ecolo, already materialized in significant achievements
in these areas through its governmental and local interests.
The climate emergency: a social, economic and environmental challenge
The components of the fifth report of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change) are published in 2013 and 20143. It indicates that it will reduce emissions of
Greenhouse gas emissions from industrialized countries of at least 25-40% by 2020 and reduce by at least
50% of global emissions by 2050 (which actually means 90% for countries
industrial), to achieve limiting global warming to a maximum 2 degrees. Beyond
this increase of 2 degrees, the IPCC predicts serious consequences for the entire
planet, with the appearance of irreversible phenomena. It is in this decade (during
the next term) than large international measures must have been taken for us
put on this track and avoid inevitable deterioration.
Any inaction to curb global warming would result in "of deregulation

the economic and social activity (...) of a similar magnitude to those that followed the biggest
wars and the great depression of the first half of the twentieth century, "warned Nicholas Stern,
former chief economist of the World Bank, on the occasion of the publication, in October 2006,
the report that bears his name. According to these estimates, countries should devote 1% of GDP
World per year in the fight against the spiral of rising temperatures, while all passivity
would result ultimately in an annual burden of 5% of global GDP. According to
Stern4 most recent estimates, in the worst scenario, the cost of inaction would be "a
thirds or more "of global GDP. According to OECD estimates, the annual cost of damage
caused by inaction would be at 5.5% of world GDP in 2050. The OECD also believes that
delaying the start of the 2020 investment would increase the cost of damage in 2050 50% 5.
It is clear today that the choice can not be inaction or adjournment and that the
Global warming is both an economic and social environmental problem.
Continue the energy change
Dramatic increases and changes in the price of oil and gas products clearly show
Tensions increasingly large between supply and demand for energy. These tensions will
increase gradually as the exhaustion of reserves that first will touch the oil, then the
gas, uranium before the end of the twenty and later coal. In addition, shale gas and
Other unconventional sources do not provide acceptable solutions for communities
since their exploitation is not done at the cost of environmental damage very
including significant climate, where it creates significant health risks, and offers
a thin face within the foreseeable depletion of hydrocarbons.
The social consequences of these tensions are already high: the proportion of revenues
devoted to energy is becoming higher for low incomes, who know in
Consequently living conditions increasingly precarious. Access to energy has become THE
social issue of the XXI century: citizens may be faced with having to choose
between food, heat or move.
Moreover, the Fukushima disaster reminded us that nuclear, zero risk
does not exist. It remains essential to close as soon as possible nuclear reactors still in
activity and to ensure the full financing of dismantling and management
waste by producers.
For these reasons, Belgium, as Europe must substantially increase its
energy independence (Belgium imported 94% of final energy in 2012) compared to

fossil and fissile fuels, starting with better energy efficiency for the benefit of
all categories of the population. The potential for cost-effective energy efficiency is indeed
huge in our country6. It should also develop renewable energies,
notably to contribute to the country's energy independence. The federation of producers
renewable energy, Edora, said the Belgian potential for 2020 may cover between
16 and 18% of the belge7 energy consumption. The ICEDD, VITO and Bureau estimate
as for them it is possible to produce 100% of Belgian energy needs from
renewable sources by 20508. Finally, as an example, in 2012, the Belgian energy imports
fossil and fissile cost more than € 18 billion, or nearly 5% of our GDP.
The energy, an important source of jobs
The sectors of energy savings, energy efficiency and renewable energy
constitute considerable employment potential. It is necessary to develop policies
economic and scientific that aim to establish in Belgium a maximum of these jobs
sectors. In 2011, the market for renewable energy in all sectors, employed 16,650
people in Belgium, of which 9400 in Wallonia. According to Cap Gemini and AGORIA, it is estimated that
Wallonia has a potential to create 15,000 additional jobs by 2020 in the sector
the renouvelable9 energy. The Federal Planning Bureau estimates that the transition to a system
100% renewable energy by 2030 in Belgium can generate up to 60,000 jobs
supplémentaires10. In the energy saving sector, the potential is also important.
Thus, for example, the Confederation of Construction estimates that the greening
the economy alone is expected to create 13 500 jobs in Belgium in 10 years11. A
accelerating the pace of energy retrofits could double that figure.

The political horizon of Ecolo for energy: use less, do better
and produce differently
Control consumption using energy rationally
Improving the overall energy efficiency is the priority that should guide any policy
energy. Making production and consumption more efficient energy, you spend less and
improves the quality of life. In addition, energy efficiency techniques are very often
fastest, most cost effective and least costly to reduce CO2 emissions.
Beyond reducing consumption through energy efficiency, it should also
develop some energy sobriety, that is to say to adapt our lifestyle to
new energy controlling our movements or making possible the mobilities
mild (walking, cycling or public transport), in good conditions of access and
security, or by avoiding the use of energy efficient electrical appliances, for example.
Choose the most appropriate energy sources needs
Should be limited to the most effective applications of thermal uses électricité12,
to prohibit the direct electric heating in new buildings, except for the pumps

heat, and gradually replace the existing buildings, to favor
Fuels and emit less greenhouse gas for vehicles,
promote the use of solar energy to heat water ... On the other hand, it should be the least
be dependent on a single energy source, among others for his personal residence.
Ensure accessibility of all to sustainable energy and energy saving
The evolution of energy prices and the economic crisis putting more and more households
financial difficulty, depriving them of the means to confront the profound changes
energy sector. The right to have a minimum amount of cheap energy must
be reinforced by social measures coordinated. Similarly, each household, each person
must have access to energy efficiency measures, production and use of energy
renewable. Rethink its energy consumption is not easy and
also requires means, including making the necessary investments that
will lower the energy bill. It is therefore essential that governments
put everything in place so that this approach is possible for each and everyone.

In this regard, Ecolo made several proposals on two key levers:
Acting on the quality of housing by improving their insulation;
Protect the weakest of fluctuations in energy prices.
These proposals are further developed in the "fight against precariousness" of
this program.
Allowing citizens to be involved in energy production
Except in the field of renewable energy, power generation is concentrated in
large oligopolies that control much of the market. To involve citizens and
regain a share of economic and energy independence, it is desirable to develop
mechanisms that allow new economic players such as local authorities
or cooperatives, to emerge in the renewable energy sector and thus make a
place on the electricity market. It should also support renewable autoproducers.
The profits from the energy sector, driven by the community and return directly
the community. It is also as a sustainable and economic activity can not be relocated.
Guarantee the sovereignty and energy independence
The energy dependence of Europe and outside of Belgium vis-à-vis is a
political and economic handicap increasingly large. We must develop a policy
European and international security and guaranteeing the overall stability of supply
energy, within the framework of sustainable development and a pacifist policy. That implies
amplify the production of renewable energy on the EU territory and its periphery,
enhance energy efficiency, to be supplemented by active demand management and
energy supply (consumption control and intelligent network management), improving
energy transportation, diversifying supply sources and regions, and to
Place a European policy for energy storage leading to the development of
new capabilities for all.
Limiting the environmental risks of energy production
For Ecolo, it is essential to limit the environmental risks of production chains
energy. Electricity production by fission nucléaire13 involves risks that make
unacceptable pursuit and, a fortiori, its enlargement. The alleged fourth reactors
Generation currently exist only on paper and in the best case, they will

Nuclear fission is to separate a heavy atomic nucleus into several lighter nuclides. The reaction of
separation exothermed, then converted into electricity. But the reaction also releases of radioactivity and
hazardous compounds.

marketed as from 2050. None of the currently proposed projects would not
solve the three main problems of nuclear power, namely security, proliferation and
waste. And the merger will not play a role at best before the second half of the century, which
In any event too late in relation to the climate emergency and offers no way out of the
current energy issues.
Finally, exploitation of natural resources can not lead to a deterioration
the environment or the diversion of food production. Establishing criteria
durability for all energy sources is essential, as well as control
of the energy production of the biomass.

Ecolo force lines on energy
For Ecolo should be rational use of energy and to move towards an energy system
100% renewable by 2050 to avoid the addition of the negative effects of upheavals
climate and nuclear, and prepare for the era of the post-oil. To do this, priorities
Ecolo are the following:
Enhance the potential for energy efficiency and energy saving in order to
reduce energy bills;
Operate a real energy transition;
During the transition period, limiting environmental and health risks of
energy production ;
Reply with ambition and belief to the climate challenge at the regional, Belgian,
European and global.

Priorities and proposals on energy Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: ENHANCE THE POTENTIAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY
ENERGY SAVING AND REDUCE ENERGY BILL
Proposal: Continue to invest heavily in housing insulation and
efficient heating systems through the EEA
Thanks to environmentalists, the first Employment-Environment Alliance (EEA) have been launched
Brussels and Wallonia. Governments and their partners - business federations
construction, public interest organizations and public services, trade unions,
training operators as well as groups and active groups in the field of
Construction and Sustainable Development - are mobilizing around a common goal: to make
improving the environment through energy efficiency of housing, a source
economic opportunities and job creation, knowing that also result in
improved household budgets.
Specifically, the Regions and their partners agree on three fronts:
stimulate demand for renovation and sustainable construction of private buildings
public;
strengthen the supply and construction sector capacity;
develop skills through a comprehensive program of training green.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENERGY AND CLIMATE - p 5/27

Ecolo intends to consolidate and strengthen job-environnement14 current alliances and develop
news.

Proposal: Ensure access of all to energy efficiency
To reduce the energy consumption of landlords and tenants and enable them to
finance the necessary works, Ecolo proposes to continue and strengthen the implementation of
financial incentives such as energy premiums, the Ecopack (Wallonia) and the Green Ready (Brussels) to
that those who do not have their own funds can make the necessary investments
in their housing.
The funding mechanism makes investment in energy savings and
renewable energy "painless": the household is not to advance equity and
repaid monthly payment remains less than or equal to the energy savings from the
decrease in énergie15 bills. In addition, for households below an income level
to define, the company helps to remove any interest in order to achieve a rate loan
zero.
Ecolo proposes the creation of a vert16 booklet. The money saved would aim to support
activities reaching a balance between economic development and respect for workers, the
workers and the environment. Could thus be financed, SMEs, individuals
or companies active in green technologies or perform work related to the reduction
energy consumption.
Persons for whom an abnormally high power consumption is detected during
audit or on the basis of invoices, also benefit from support type guidance
energy.
Moreover, especially for tenants and older people, proposes that the Ecolo
Energy Saver loan is not linked to individuals but to the building. Specifically, as
these people occupy the building, they repay the loan in proportion to the energy savings,
minus a sum to reward approach. The next occupant housing
pursue reimbursement under the same conditions. Moreover, to avoid soaring prices
rents, work to improve the energy quality of the rented accommodation should not
lead to higher rents than the economy thanks to the work carried out during
the duration of the repayment period, net of public aid received by the
owner.

Proposal: Establish ambitious energy standards for
the buildings
To make the housing stock and much more efficient offices, it is necessary to
strengthen requirements for energy performance of buildings and extend its
scope for any major renovation of a dwelling and any provision of
housing. This will support today in the renovation and low energy house
construction of very low energy or passive houses. In compliance with European standards,
From 2015, new constructions should be passive or provide standard
equivalent overall performance (1.5 liters of fuel oil or 15 kWh / m² / year) and major renovations
should lead to "low energy" buildings (3 liters of fuel oil or 30 kWh / m² / year)
the objective being to achieve the positive energy house (that is to say whose production exceeds the
energy consumption) for 2020.

14

The employment-environment alliances now come in different sectoral axes in addition to construction
durable: the axis "resources and waste" axis "sustainable food" and "water" axis.
15
See on this subject our proposals Chapter "Housing".
16
See Chapter "Independents and SMEs".

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENERGY AND CLIMATE - p 6/27

The adoption of energy standards for rental accommodation in parallel with control
rents, is also required to obtain a real decrease in the price (rent + charges
energy) housing.
The current incentive systems for the construction and renovation beyond the standards
energy performance of buildings will be strengthened, such as initiatives
on best buildings.

Proposal: Establish ambitious energy standards for
energy-intensive equipment
Ecolo proposes to set ambitious energy standards for all equipment
energy consumers and especially for electrical units,
both in active mode than in standby mode. Like what has been done for energy-saving bulbs,
Ecolo proposes to ban the sale unnecessarily drain devices where alternatives
that make the same service available on the market. If the European level appears most effective,
initiatives may nevertheless be carried out in Belgium.

Proposal: Reduce VAT on investments
energy savings
To promote energy savings, Ecolo proposes to reduce VAT rates of 21-6%
in particular for the construction of passive houses or reaching a performance standard
Overall equivalent low energy renovation, after the sale of heat heating networks,
the power generation equipment, equipment and systems for savings
energy and ecological materials. This measure should be extended at European level in
a second time.

Proposal: Reduce emissions of greenhouse gas in
transports17 the sector
It is essential to act on emissions rising in the transport sector, responsible alone
22.5% of the total emissions of Belgium. To do this, it is necessary to reduce
travel needs, including better structuring of the territory, to contain
Total distances traveled by vehicles, reduce emissions and each véhicule18
to arrange transport to modes consume less energy and movement
CO2 transmitters, while taking account of other pollutants. These same rules must be
applied to company cars.
In this context, the priority is to strengthen emissions standards and energy efficiency
Car manufacturers. To accelerate this process, Ecolo proposes that the European Union
adopt a binding target of 80gCO2 / km and a Ecoscore 100 cars put on
the market by 202019. This target would aim as the average values ​​that maximum values
do not cross.
Ecolo considers it appropriate to favor, for large tonnages, the vehicles using gas
Compressed natural, whose environmental performance is better and it is possible
feeding with locally produced biogas. Rail and waterway must also be
favored.

Vehicles of performance measures should be based on actual reproducible trips daily.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENERGY AND CLIMATE - p 7/27

Finally, Ecolo intends greening véhicules20 captive fleets.

Proposal: To support citizens in their efforts to reduce the
energy consumption
For Ecolo, governments must also act proactively to advise
households in a relief approach their energy bills and head towards the
renewable energy consumption. The energy guidance, whether collective,
individual or social, should be driven to enable every household to acquire
new consumption habits less energy and therefore less costly. Ecolo estimates
several operators (beside Ecopasseurs, CPAS, energy tutors, home
Energy counters in Brussels and in Wallonia energy) must be able to take the initiative
these guidances (as examples, communal services, energy suppliers under
public service obligations, unions or associations ...), especially when
abnormally high energy consumption are recognized by suppliers or
Network Manager.
Ecolo proposes that the authorities are more attentive to the implementation of the publicity surrounding
energy performance certificates and that it evolves in the medium term so that it can
inquire correctly - as required by the latest European Directive - the
Technical recommendations for improving energy efficiency of the building.
The energy audit should also be further encouraged. It will tell the
landlords and tenants work to be done in their homes, establishing an order of
priority investments according to their cost-effectiveness, their impact on the
energy consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases. The audit is also an opportunity
awareness of the impact of behaviors and possible developments. All households
difficulty paying their energy bills, households and low-income households
consumption is abnormally high should be offered an energy audit. This
audit will be supported by the government for low income households.

Proposal: Supporting economic actors in their efforts to
reducing energy consumption
For Ecolo, beyond the instruments provided in branche21 agreements, governments
must also be proactive in advising SMEs and independent in
Relief approach their energy bills and head of energy consumption
renewable. The energy guidance must be driven to enable all actors
economic gain new consumer habits less energy and therefore less
expensive.
The energy audit should also be further encouraged. It will indicate to players
economic investments to be made in their activities, by establishing an order of priorities
investments according to their cost-effectiveness, their impact on consumption
energy and emissions of greenhouse gases. The audit is also an opportunity to raise awareness
the impact of behaviors and possible developments.

20

Captive fleets are the fleet administrations and companies (eg Post), which are
attached to a daily basis.
21
A sectoral agreement is a voluntary agreement between the Walloon Region and professional federation to reduce
CO2 emissions (index IGES) and energy efficiency (IEE index) companies that are part of
the agreement. In late 2011, 16 federations grouping 177 companies for 219 operations sites (Agoria, Fedustria, Essenscia,
Fevia, Cobelpa, GSV, Fetra-Febelgra, IVF, FBB-Fedicer, Febelcem, Fediex, Carmeuse, Lhoist and UWE) are involved in
branch agreements. The first generation of sectoral agreements in Wallonia allowed between 2000 and 2012
energy consumption savings of over 15%.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENERGY AND CLIMATE - p 8/27

The carbon balance, in addition to the energy audit should enable businesses and
farmers to move towards sustainable economic development.
Encourage electro-intensive companies to improve their energy performance
The electro-intensive industrial companies (metals, cement, chemistry ...) have an important role to
play in the integration of renewable energies in the Belgian electricity park. As large
consumers, they have an interesting potential flexibility to manage the adequacy of
production to consumption (and vice versa). This must be valued through a
framework that promotes its mobilization, including through preferential tariffs on transportation and
distribution or through flexible wage contracts with network operators.
Companies must be encouraged to invest in the best technologies available for
remain competitive on the international market.
It should also ensure that these businesses are relocating to countries where constraints
Environmental and they are smaller and move their emissions of greenhouse gases
Greenhouse, whose effects are global, but also the jobs and economic activity as are
linked.
Support for investment shall be done through investment incentives and mechanisms
exemption from surcharges on energy for incompressible part of consumption
industrial processes. In the industrial sector, energy intensity and emission criteria
specific (energy consumed and CO2 emissions per unit of product) must take precedence over the
consumption and total emissions. In the same way as the mechanism
European CO2 quota allocation for non-protected sectors, benchmarks will
established to define the energy intensity criteria for the best technologies
available. Each company will be encouraged to close the gap with "best of class"
thanks to the partial exemption system overload on energy and marginal pricing
incentive.

Proposal: Establish third-investor "energy efficiency"
for institutions, corporations and
the non-profit sector
Ecolo intends to support, through the mechanism of the third investor, business investment,
institutions and non-profit sector to improve energy efficiency and
develop renewable energy. Under this formula, the third investor funds and executes
work to achieve energy savings; he repays by savings
Financial realized from lower energy bills generated by this work.
Ecolo offers:
To support these investments in companies, tripling the percentage of
increased deduction for investment, with the 13.5 to 40.5% 22;
Clarify the rules on public procurement to reflect this type of
market with intervention of third-investor. This clarification is needed to
determine the method of awarding the contract but also to determine on what basis
tenders should be compared;
Reinforce the action of the federal Third investor - Fedesco - and to develop tools
Similar in Regions;
That formulas third-investors become eligible in the same way as other
all aid work in the voluntary sector and non-profit. In parallel,

22

Ecolo has filed a motion for a resolution detailing these proposals in November 2004 in the Federal Parliament.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENERGY AND CLIMATE - p 9/27

good governance rules for third party investors will be implemented to prevent
fraudulent activity in the sector.

Proposal: Mobilizing local authorities
The government has an exemplary role to play vis-à-vis the population and businesses
to drive the changes imposed to climate protection. They must as well take
Further measures than those imposed under the current regulations, both at
their buildings, as mobility and energy supplies, for example.
Specifically, Ecolo intends to invite local authorities to:
strengthen their exemplary role and take account of their territory, all the
emissions of greenhouse gases in all sectors of activity and consumption
energy of their services, buildings, vehicles ... Local authorities must also
take into account in their policies all GHG emissions in all
industries and energy consumption in their territory;
pursue and strengthen their outreach initiatives and information to the population
for energy savings (advisory, etc.);
develop a common plan for climate and energy management with a program of actions
contact by implementing gas reduction efforts of greenhouse gases to
reducing energy consumption and developing renewable energy
or integrate energy and climate aspects in their existing plans (Agenda 21,
PST23 or PCDR24 ...);
participate in initiatives such as the League of renewable energy,
Covenant of Mayors, etc. ;
act in the renewable energy sector, both in production and in
marketing, as proposed by the Union of Cities and Municipalities and Boards
autonomous communal;
mediate between the companies third-investors and housing companies
social, so as to accelerate building insulation and improving their
energy performance and, consequently, increase the welfare of the inhabitants.

PRIORITY 2: OPERATE A REAL ENERGY TRANSITION
Belgium needs to catch up compared to the European average to reach
the most advanced countries in terms of energy production from renewable sources, both
enhance its potential with the greatest possible efficiency to master these new
technologies, create many jobs and thus be an engine in this new development
industrial.
In 2012, the country imported nearly 94% of the energy it consumes (in the form of products
oil, coal, natural gas, uranium ...). Thanks to the action of environmentalists, the
development of renewable energy has allowed and will also reduce dependence
Belgique25 of energy.
Today, European energy infrastructure, including the Belgian, are aging and
must be renewed. This means that significant investment will be that as
or be made, regardless of the chosen energy source. These investments will be

In 2000, Belgium imported 99% of its energy.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENERGY AND CLIMATE - p 10/27

structuring for decades to come. That is why it is important to ask the choices today
more sustainable, more justifiable both environmentally and economically. And on the subject,
no energy source has so many benefits that renewable energy sources.
This is why the European authorities have set a target of 13% renewable energy
in final energy consumption by 2020, in Belgium, under the "package
3x20 ". The action of environmentalists helped increase this target to 20% by 2020 in Wallonia, including
8000 GWh of renewable electricity.
For Ecolo, this target should be increased to 35% at the Belgian level in 2030 increased
research and development credits, for coordinated support to the sector,
by setting sectoral targets (electricity and heat, housing, businesses, agriculture)
ambitious and the active participation of Belgium in major international projects.
To achieve this, Ecolo makes a series of proposals.

Proposal: Create a "renewable energy" axis in the fund
Strategic Basic Research
Ecolo wants to find ways to be successful energy transition by funding research
fundamental in renewable energy. For too long, the nuclear sector has eaten
largest share of subsidies allocated for basic research into energy. By creating a new
strategic axis dedicated to renewable energies in the new Research Fund
Fundamental Strategic (LILE) FNRS, many research projects could be
funded to meet the challenges of resource depletion and protecting our
environment.
Specifically, Ecolo proposes that:
credits for research and development of green energy production are
increased, including hydropower, tidal, wind and
geothermal, solar thermal, photovoltaics and gas and renewable
a more efficient use of biomass;
this research not only aimed at improving the efficiency of energy
renewable but also to reduce the potential environmental impacts
(landscape integration of wind turbines, emissions due to the combustion of biomass ...)
funds be mobilized for research and development on the storage
energy (including renewable gas) since it will be an addition
indispensable to the growing strength of the production of electricity from renewable sources.
Thanks to the platform responsible for the animation and valorisation of research in the
under the fund, the economic fabric of Wallonia and Brussels would be strengthened in this sector.
The axis dedicated to renewable energies should be adopt an annual budget of 6 million euros,
without it would come at the expense of other funds of the FNRS, since this is financing
by external donors.

Proposal: Strengthening European research
renewable energies
At European level, Ecolo regrets that, despite the progress made in the context of Horizon
2020 (the EU Framework Programme for R & D), the European Commission continues its support
Solid and priority to nuclear research or carbon capture and storage. It should

for environmentalists to reverse priorities, affecting at least 600 million euros per year
renewable energy and energy savings. Public funding of research
Nuclear must concentrate on research into safety and health.

Proposal: Abandon nuclear costly research projects
Finally, it should abandon the Belgian nuclear research project "Myrrha". Indeed, it is
actually a new reactor plutonium capable of producing new fuels
(notably MOX containing plutonium). The project designers also plan
supporting research in so-called 4th generation reactors and to study the extension of the
lifetime of the reactors. Ecolo can not subscribe to such projets26.

Proposal: Continuing vocational training programs
The rapid evolution of energy issues is an opportunity but also a challenge
for companies and independents. Therefore it is appropriate to continue programs
vocational training for energy efficiency, energy savings and energy
renewable.
It is therefore essential:
To continue to train building professionals (general contractors, architects,
energy auditors, heating engineers, plumbers, electricians ...);
Increase and evenly distribute the places for training and support training
permanent workers, workers and entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs
energy sector;
To ensure that vocational training and continuing training incorporate
more knowledge about energy efficiency and energy savings
(eco-driving, choice and knowledge of the most efficient equipment ...) and use
Optimal renewable energies in other sectors (transport, IT,
industry, services ...).
To do this, Ecolo intends to continue and amplify the employment-environment alliances to
its initiative in the Walloon and bruxelloise27 Regions.

Proposal: Further development of green electricity
The goal should be to move towards the provision at the Belgian level of over 50% electricity
renewable for 2030. The interest is threefold: to produce green and effective (best
yields) and to produce closer to consumption areas, ensuring an activity
local economic and fewer losses due to transport.
It is important that the support given to producers incentive to maximize the reduction
of greenhouse gas emissions generated by their facilities and match the
development of the most interesting and the most promising techniques. The objective is to
control the impact of support mechanisms for production technologies of green electricity on
the prices paid by households and businesses through a system of monitoring and reorientation more
effective for avoiding the excesses experienced with the unexpected success of residential photovoltaic.
More specifically, in terms of onshore wind, Ecolo supports the implementation of the Decree wind
organizing tenders per lot, to streamline the urbanistic plans
environmental implementation of future wind turbines, and to integrate new type of criteria
socio-economic and participatory.

Ecolo also believes that the European research project ITER fusion should not be considered
priority

Furthermore, Ecolo supports projects of renewable energy production facility in the Sea
North and aims to achieve a minimum capacity of 3800 MW in 2030 (against 2200 MW provided for
the current time).
Ecolo also proposes to support decentralized production of green electricity and support
local cooperatives of renewable energy by reducing VAT on
renewable energy equipment (cfr. supra). The aim is to enhance
production and local energy supply. Ecolo offers the same extent for condominiums,
particularly for photovoltaic panels and micro CHP. In this context,
Regulators must ensure that the competition rules and independent producers
vis-à-vis the distributors allow the emergence of these local and cooperative operators.
Regarding cooperative wind, Ecolo proposes to establish a facilitator - like the
other sectors - and support cooperative producers over distributors. Ecolo
also supports creation of an Energy Fund Citizen initiatives intended to enable
Access to wind property to the greatest number.

Proposal: To support the combined electricity and heat

support the establishment of networks powered by renewable energy and allow
public funding, as was done for gas and electricity.
Large heat network projects currently underway or in progress, could
federate for support through EU funds.

Proposal: To support the production of high-performance green heating
Ecolo offers better support the production of green heat:
Strengthening aid program for solar thermal water heaters and pumps
heat high coefficient of performance;
Extending the aid to agricultural and industrial solar heating;
Continue and strengthen support to improve the performance of heaters using the
biomass;
In the continuity of the energy in action in Wallonia, support development

Proposal: To develop energy management in everyday life
Ecolo proposes to set up tools for an active demand management
Energy:

Proposal: Allow each and every measure

Currently, only a portion of the electrical appliances, cars, buildings and some
few products have a label on their energy consumption.
Ecolo offers:
gradually extend this labeling to all goods and services32;
systematically mention the energy consumption and greenhouse gas

services purchased over a year and would be satisfied with every purchase (a full tank of gas, a flight in
aircraft, car ...). The purpose of this card is consumer awareness to content
CO2 of their purchases in order to be able to give personal reduction targets.

PRIORITY 3: DURING THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD REDUCE THE RISK
ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH OF POWER GENERATION
The emission of greenhouse gases is not the only consequence generated by the dies
energy. Increasing energy efficiency and shifting towards sustainability helps
greatly limit the environmental and health impacts in general.
Additional measures to reduce CO2 emissions are needed, especially
regarding the nuclear sector for which the Fukushima disaster reminds us that
zero risk does not exist, far from it.
At another level, it is also necessary to establish sustainability criteria for
renewable energy and set strict rules when CO2 storage.

Proposal: gradually Sortir du nucléaire
In Belgium, electricity accounts for just over 20% of final energy consumption, which
half, 10% is nuclear. However, this sector presents major risks.
Ecolo is proud to be the origin of the output nucléaire34 law passed in the legislature rainbow enciel (2003). Accordingly, environmentalists oppose the recent decision of the Federal Government
Refer decade closing Tihange 1.
The environmental and geopolitical risks and the costs and actual emissions from this
industry are indeed much too important to be a sustainable alternative to other
energy sources, even those that are emitting greenhouse gases.
There are indeed currently no acceptable and financeable solution for managing
nuclear waste, the danger will persist for tens of thousands of years after
storage. Moreover, the availability of natural uranium is limited and its extraction is
seriously exposing many workers. If nuclear power plants are less
emitting CO2 than gas-fired or coal, nuclear energy still emits
significant amounts of CO235.
Nuclear fission is therefore far from being the solution to the climate challenge. This is
Also extremely expensive if one applies the cost-truth. Nuclear energy has indeed been able to
develop in recent decades that publics36 enjoying huge subsidies,
particularly in research. In addition, consumers and businesses inject
every year hundreds of millions of euros in the nuclear via levies on the price
electricity (for the remediation of nuclear liabilities and the constitution of provisions for the
decommissioning of nuclear plants and the management of spent fuel). If incorporated in
fair value cost of decommissioning, waste management, different measures
external security and coverage of potential risks, nuclear power would be anything but
competitive. Not all parameters and all these costs are taken into account by
Nuclear advocates.
As for the merger, which no one is currently able to predict the impacts
Environmental his hypothetical large-scale exploitation, it will anyway
not prepared industrially by 2050 at best, which is too late in relation to the urgency of
climate challenge. Furthermore, its implementation would mobilize enormous resources in research and

For Belgium, we can evaluate the subsidies received for research to € 2.15 billion since 1974 while the
renewable energy and energy efficiency were receiving € 380 million. Nuclear pension may be valued at 12
€ billion since 1974.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENERGY AND CLIMATE - p 15/27

development, which would experience much more useful assignment, innovative and sustainable in
renewable energy and energy efficiency.
For Ecolo, besides the construction of production units (cogeneration, offshore wind, TGV ...)
already authorized, energy efficiency measures and demand management, and the
strengthening import capabilities allow calmly consider the rapid closure
the two oldest nuclear plants. The real challenge is now to develop a
ambitious energy policy for stopping the other five reactors by 2025.
Governments can therefore catch up, as governments have already made
Wallonia and Brussels, to best prepare for the closure of four reactors. The decree and
Energy and Climate Plan Walloon and Brussels, adopted on the initiative of Ecolo ministers and planning
a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases by 30% compared to 1990 emissions,
while closing nuclear power plants by 2025, proving that the decrease in gas emissions
Greenhouse is quite compatible with the output of nuclear power, as the law
2003 prévoit37.
Moreover, the liberalization of the electricity market and the aging reactors make a
effective and democratic nuclear control more essential than ever. The use of subcontracting and temporary agency workers should be discouraged in favor of a contract staff
benefiting from the most advanced training. In addition, staff must be guaranteed
the lack of sanctions when reports of security problems.

Proposal: Improve the functioning and independence of the Agency
Federal Nuclear Control
Spurred Ecolo, malfunctions of the Federal Agency for Nuclear Control (FANC)
were highlighted. It should not wait to improve the functioning of the FANC and
to make it a powerful and transparent38 regulator. To do this, the independence of the FANC must
be ensured, especially financially. Each operator active in the nuclear sector should
ensure its fair share of funding of the Agency, including material producers
Nuclear no longer directly manage their waste, the latter being managed by
the Ondraf39.
Ecolo also requests that the rules of incompatibility are set to ensure
de facto independence from the direction of the Agency vis-à-vis the economic players in the sector
nuclear.

Proposal: To review without delay the emergency plans
nuclear accidents
Belgium has 21 nuclear reactors on its territory and near its borders: 4
Doel, 3 in Tihange, 1 mol, 1 to Borssele (NL), 6 Gravelines (F), 2 to Chooz (F) and 4 Cattenom (F)
but also the IRE (National Institute of radionuclides) in Fleurus and CEN (Study Centre
Nuclear Energy) in Mol. No other country has nuclear plants located too
near major urban centers. Within a radius of 30 km around Doel and Tihange
live respectively 1.5 million and 840 thousand citizens. The federal government, charged with
international conventions and national legislation to protect the population, almost seriously
his duty.

37

Belgium has reduced its emissions of greenhouse gas by 17.5% compared to 1990.
Ecolo has formulated a set of recommendations to that effect in a resolution tabled in Parliament
Federal in 2007.
39
Agency for Radioactive Waste and Enriched Fissile Materials.
38

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENERGY AND CLIMATE - p 16/27

The nuclear emergency plans are hopelessly outdated and offer no solution
satisfactory regarding the evacuation to home and required relocation of these families in case
a nuclear accident.
The emergency procedures in case of accident must be improved: the ability of local actors
(police, fire departments, mayors, schools ...) must be strengthened, realistic exercises
must be made and the public should be better involved.
The discharge area and distribution of iodine pellets set at 20 km today must be
expanded to 30 km around Doel, Tihange, Chooz, Mol-Dessel and Borssele.
Ecolo also calls for the implementation of the Chernobyl Commission recommendations
Senate dating ... of 199140, which already made a series of recommendations never implemented
implemented.
Finally, Ecolo calls for the requirement of a cross-border collaboration in the field, risks
do not stop at country borders.

Proposal: To ensure the financing by producers of dismantling
nuclear facilities and waste management
It is important that the management of radioactive waste from the nuclear power industry is the point of
financial view, totally dependent on their producers and that these constitute provisions
sound and adequate to finance, sometimes for long periods, the cost of
decommissioning and waste management. Today, waste producers other than
plant operators are under no obligation in terms of constitution
provisions. As for the provisions made by operators of nuclear power plants, their
amounts and availability are doubtful.
Ecolo hear that steps are taken to:
minimize the amount of radioactive waste products (eg no
reprocessing of spent fuel, decommissioning limited ...);
provide temporary and reversible storage of waste in order to better control if
problem (as is already the case with Belgoprocess, in Dessel) and the power
out if a technical solution treatment or disposal were to be
discovery ;
favor a waste storage area, preferably on the same sites places
disused production (plants ...) in order to ensure optimum monitoring;
ensure that prices paid by producers for ONDRAF for the removal of their
waste includes a component "setting deposit" adequate, allow to face
all future costs of waste storage matters, regardless of the option
withholding storage;
guaranteeing the actual availability of funds for decommissioning nuclear power plants and
radioactifs41 waste management.

Proposal: To introduce unlimited liability of the nuclear sector,
Like all energy producers
The Fukushima disaster has reopened the debate on insurance "risk" dependent operators

If a nuclear accident occurred in our latitudes, it is likely that causes damage

also extremely expensive (in France, a serious nuclear accident could cost up
430 billion euros, the equivalent of the GDP of Belgium!). However, in case of exceeding the
Ceiling coverage imposed on operators which is currently 1.2 billion euros
site, it would essentially the government to assume the financial impact of the accident.
Today the profits of the nuclear sector are largely privatized, while costs in case
a nuclear accident would weigh heavily on the community.
The logic must be inversée42. For Ecolo, the nuclear industry should be subject to
unlimited liability, as is the case with other energy producers, they
use gas or wind, and as is the case for the nuclear power producers
Germany.

Proposal: Adopt social tags, environment and energy
the development of biofuels
The need to spend some oil gave the illusion that agrofuels could
easily meet the energy needs inconsiderate world today. Environmentalists and
NGOs have nevertheless always pointed the limits of these new channels.
The lack of appropriate environmental tag has negative impacts on intensifying
crops, the destruction of forests, wetlands and natural habitats and populations
who live and whose food security is threatened. In addition, replacement of
food crops with energy crops contributes in part to the rise in food prices
food.
These negative effects are all the more important that we continue to consume resources
same pace as before, leading to an impasse.
For biofuels, Ecolo offers:
to adopt sustainability criteria for each fuel type and fuel,
taking into account the impact of indirect change of land use (eg exodus
rural) ;
to waive the mandatory target set by the European Commission 6%
fuels from renewable sources to be achieved by 2020, as long as the evidence is not
provided they are produced truly sustainable in ecological and
social ;
to prohibit subsidies and other preferential schemes that favor the production
of biofuels at the expense of food crops;
to support more strongly the production of renewable fuels from
waste (eg bus biogas from organic waste), and to strengthen
research for agro-fuels produced from agricultural by-products and
waste as well as from non-competing or complementary plants to
food production that have a high efficiency and benefits
recognized environmental (eg algae).

Proposal: Oversee the development of the use of biomass for
energy purposes
Biomass is a very valuable resource. It should be used primarily in its
food applications and materials (timber, construction, bio-based chemicals, paper ...).

42

http://www.lachambre.be/FLWB/PDF/53/1941/53K1941001.pdf

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENERGY AND CLIMATE - p 18/27

Before developing biomass-energy sectors, it is necessary to verify its interaction with
other sectors using this resource.
In terms of production of electricity and heat, biomass has great potential,
condition for the effective use of (primarily in cogeneration units). The fact of
able to mobilize when needed makes it particularly interesting complement
renewable energy sources variables (wind, solar).
For biomass for energy purposes, Ecolo offers:
develop a sustainability standard and to require the immediate implementation and
complete, both at the production level as the import of biomass (the
evaluation and control mechanisms must be put in place);
to estimate the potential of the logging and wood waste (including forestry)
avoiding the depletion of forest ecosystems;
to strive for environmental excellence in the field of combustion technology and type
fuels to prevent local air pollution;
in these conditions, to promote the sector as a priority of biométhanisation43.
Furthermore, Ecolo proposes to define, adopt and implement a comprehensive strategy for
biomass reconciling all uses of biomass and ensuring a coherent,
sustainable and efficient both Belgian and European level.

Proposal: Establish sustainability criteria on sectors
economy and energy production
It is important to anticipate the negative effects of all energy sectors: exploitation
oil and gas fields, production of fuel from coal, hydrogen technology,
Use the oil sands, shale gas extraction, land grabbing for
agrofuel crops, working conditions. This is also true for the energy sector
renewable and insulation sector. The life cycle analysis should be performed prior to
implement sustainability criteria and to minimize the environmental impact and
Social dies and, if necessary, to prohibit certain practices.
In any case, in view of their environmental impact (air pollution, groundwater
and waterways, soil and subsoil) and the quality of life of residents, Ecolo offers
prohibit the use of extra heavy oil, shale gas oil sands and their derivatives,
and limit the sulfur content of fuel 50 ppm.
Only the recovery of gas from the natural degradation of coal seams exploited
previously in Belgium may be authorized in cases where the chemical fracturing is not
necessary.

Proposal: Establish strict rules regarding capture and
CO2 storage
The capture and storage of CO2 from major emitting facilities are a solution which
feasibility, sustainability and profitability are still far from being demonstrated.
Ecolo believes in any case necessary to set strict rules before implementing
this technology and therefore proposes:

43

Biomethanation recycles organic waste (among other agricultural), is based on local roots and produces
supplements fertilizers for agriculture.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENERGY AND CLIMATE - p 19/27

to ensure that new large CO2 installations can be émissions44
necessarily supplemented capture and storage systems;
in the transition period lead us to an energy system 100%
renewable, to limit the level of CO2 emissions from new power plants
350gCO2 / kWh;
to establish rules ensuring freedom from leaking CO2 tanks and make
responsible long-term corporate issuers of reservoir management and
leakage of CO2;
to prohibit any volatile storage (deep ocean trenches ...).

PRIORITY 4: MEET WITH AMBITION AND BELIEF IN THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE
LOCAL, REGIONAL, BELGIUM, EUROPEAN AND WORLD
It was during this decade that the large international measures must be taken to limit
Warming of the climate to maximum 2 degrees on average goal also adopted by the Union
European. To reach it, the IPCC recommends reductions of 25-40% of emissions
Greenhouse gas emissions in industrialized countries by 2020. This is a minimum target, because since the
publication of this report, new studies have shown that emissions continue to grow
faster than expected.
In the longer term, it will converge emission levels of around 2 tons of gas
greenhouse gases (equivalent CO2) per year per person ... against 14 tonnes aujourd'hui45.
The climate challenge will be met with emerging countries whose development risk
generate significant emissions increases, even if it is the developed countries that are
historical responsibility for climate problem and need, immediately, accomplish more
Much of the effort. For environmentalists, the aim should be equal sharing of resources
long-term globally. In this context, it is essential that all countries
industrialized and emerging stand together and get involved in an international negotiation
lead to a real reduction in global emissions of greenhouse gases.
It is also all the actors and sectors that need to be mobilized for the transition
Energy: economic sectors but also those of transport, housing and the tertiary
responsible of the largest increases, should significantly decrease their
energy consumption and operate primarily the enormous potential of energy efficiency.
In order to significantly reduce our dependence on fossil and fissile fuels, and to prepare the
Belgium Peak Oil, Ecolo plans to diversify our supply sources by increasing the
share of renewable energy in final energy consumption (electricity, heat and
transport) at least 20% in 2020 (target already adopted by the Walloon Government, on the initiative
environmentalists), 35% in 2030 and to move towards 100% by 2050.

Proposal: Adopt a cooperation agreement on climate change and the transition
energy for 2020 and beyond
Our country suffers from the lack of a real national authority of management and coordination
on climate, which would be responsible for setting binding sectoral targets and monitoring and,
if appropriate, sanctions for non-compliance. This lack of coordination weakens the

In Belgium, each inhabitant emits, all activities included, 14 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year. The target of 2 tonnes
for example corresponds to the emissions of a passenger on a flight from Brussels to New York, or emissions of heating a
Brussels in one year.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENERGY AND CLIMATE - p 20/27

actions at regional and local levels (renewable energy policy,
saving energy, climate policy).
The coordination of climate policy must remain under federal jurisdiction, the regions retaining
therefore skills in areas under their purview, and to define
execute such a policy. The federal level should also be empowered to formulate objectives
binding emissions after a consultation with the Regions, based on a mechanism
similar to that of carbon budgets adopted in the Walloon decree climate in connection with the
Climate accountability mechanism in place for the building sector emissions.
The medium and long term goals and the means to achieve them by 2020 and beyond, should be set by an authority independent of the energy transition and adopted
within a cooperation agreement on climate and energy transition between the state and federal
federated entities

Proposal: Strengthen the leading role of Europe in energy and
fight against climate changes
Ecolo calls for Belgium and the European Union continue to play a leading role (pack
climate and energy, unique voice via the special commissioner) in international negotiations
the climate.
In this context, the objective
60% in 2030 and 90%
provides for a reduction
energy independence

Europe must reduce its emissions of greenhouse gas from
2050. Currently, the packet "energy climate" European
20% of emissions in 2020, which is insufficient to ensure
Europe and meet the climate challenge.

The European Commission, the Heads of State and Government, however, plan to wear
this reduction to 30% if an international agreement imposing equivalent measures. A
40% target is attainable, at least for three quarters by measures taken within
EU borders. The remaining quarter will be complemented by measures to reduce verified
and additional gas emissions greenhouse outside its territory.
Binding targets and trajectories for 2030 should be set for the three pillars
that are :
reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 60% compared to 1990;
increasing energy efficiency by 45% from 200546;
the development of renewable energies to increase the share of consumption
final energy from renewable to 45%.
Kyoto measures should be maintained or amplified on the basis of the assessment of their
efficiency, until the entry into force of the new agreements. To achieve while preserving
the European economy, especially Ecolo considers necessary to establish tariffs
social and environmental level européen47.
Finally, Ecolo considers it necessary to strengthen the skills of European Commissioner
climate.

46

At European level, both dates refer to the objectives: 1990 and 2005. 1990 is the reference date
for the Kyoto Protocol and the emissions of greenhouse gases for the EU. 2005 is the record date
for measures in the energy / climate package (renewable energy, energy efficiency and gas emission effect
greenhouse). The 2005 date was chosen instead of 1990 because it allows the use of harmonized statistics at
European and in terms of greenhouse gases, which therefore not based on emissions from the communist period
East European countries.
47
For more information on the proposed Ecolo on this, see Chapter "ecological transition".

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENERGY AND CLIMATE - p 21/27

Proposal: Create a European Community for Renewable Energy
(ERENE)
Common action in the field of renewable energies could lead to results
unrealizable only by the individual actions of Member States. The coordination is still needed
for planning and complementarity of renewable sources of electricity for the
design of trans-European transport network for the delivery of energy to the
consumers and the implementation and optimal energy storage facilities use.
With all European green parties, Ecolo proposes the creation of a Community
European Renewable Energy (European Community for Renewable Energy - ERENE), which
Euratom48 replace.
The aim of ERENE would be to overcome Europe's dependence on fossil fuels and
uranium, and to ensure the transition of the European energy sector to energy
renewable, taking advantage of Europe's diversity to climate levels, geographical and
Hydrological. This Community is the European equivalent of IRENA (International Renewable
Energy Agency).
This institution also would aim to work towards pooling mechanisms
support renewable generation, so as to avoid distortions of competition in the
cost of electricity in the EU countries.

Proposal: To enhance the security of supply of Europe
Electricity production from renewable sources must continue to grow at a pace
supported. It is therefore necessary to implement a renewable electricity system planning
and ensure coordination at European level.
For countries bordering the North Sea, offshore wind is needed in a sustainable energy mix:


Belgium must use this great potential for its own energy needs but also for
become a hub of renewable electricity. Besides Belgium, other
electrical super-grid projects are on track, which should be coordinated quickly to
to allow the large-scale integration of renewable electricity and running ability
storage hydropower, including (for example in a multitude of microsites
decentralized along valleys) to compensate for the variability of wind power.
This network should provide forward the connection to solar thermal power plants in the basin
and Mediterranean countries with significant potential storage hydropower
(eg. Norway). Priority access to the network must be guaranteed renewable and
offshore wind in particular.
Furthermore, both during the transition period towards a model of energy production 100%
that renewable thereafter, the European regional level is best suited to ensure the
security of supply. The pooling of reserve units, the development of
interconnections and funding of these services that benefit all Europeans, should be
supported equally. Ecolo therefore proposes that the European Union receives
Supply security skills.

Proposal: Develop a global climate governance
Today, countries that have a numerical target under the Kyoto Protocol produce less
50% of greenhouse gas emissions. It is therefore essential that all countries
industrialized (starting with the United States) and countries with an emerging economy

48

European Community Atomic Energy.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENERGY AND CLIMATE - p 22/27

are involved in future international climate agreements, while taking account of
differentiated the capacities of different regions of the world.
In this context, Ecolo proposed as basic international negotiations:
eventually converging to levels of emissions per person consistent with the limit
Maximum concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is 350 ppm CO2e;
setting goals for emissions but differentiated binding greenhouse gas.
These would function past responsibilities, current levels of emissions,
the growth in emissions in the current period and the projected ability to reduce or
to limit growth, this in the convergence objective in the long term emissions
greenhouse gas per individual to a level that limits global warming to
maximum 2 degrees on average compared to the preindustrial era. For the old country
industrialization (USA, Europe, Russia ...), this implies reduction targets
very ambitious in the short to medium and long term. Industrializing countries more
recent (China, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, for example), with emissions
significant and growing, must also have emission caps
binding but allowing them a legitimate development;
to determine, in the short term for emerging reduction targets
"Relative" (eg in terms of energy efficiency by sector or per unit of GDP)
or stabilization of absolute emissions. For the poorest countries whose level
CO2 emissions would be below a level to be determined, Ecolo proposes to determine
objectives in terms of actions to limit CO2 emissions from certain activities or
some sectors, for example in terms of déforestation49;
to develop international solidarity mechanisms in the interests of fairness and under
penalty of up strong pressure from the victims of these countries
upheaval;
develop parallel strategies for adaptation to climate changes in
current and expected;
to transfer without waiting to emerging countries and especially the poorest countries,
the knowledge and the most advanced technologies in production
energy, energy efficiency, rational use of energy and adaptation
global warming ;
to negotiate a partnership between the European Union, China and India, and even Brazil
(technological partnership, exchange of emission rights, for example), which should
help facilitate a multilateral international agreement;
to reform completely the "mechanism propre50 development" to obtain
a real reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, to limit the support to
renewable energy and more efficient use of them and to allow its
Use at European level, only to spend 30 to 40% reduction in
emissions by 2020. In addition, the budget for these mechanisms can not be

Proposal: To regulate internationally the energy sector and
Greenhouse gas emissions
Establish a World Environment Organisation (WEO)
Ecolo proposes the creation of a World Environment Organization, whose mission would be
assist countries and companies in their transition to a post-fossil energy era and uranium and
in their mastery of greenhouse gas emissions.
This agency:
encourage the development and diffusion of renewable energy (resuming
skills IRENA), energy efficiency technologies and technologies
to reduce emissions of greenhouse gas in all member countries;
would be responsible for maintaining biodiversity and improving the state of the environment (quality
air, water, soil) to improve the health of all citizens of our
planet, starting with access to safe water;
would be responsible for monitoring the international energy markets to avoid any form
speculation, cartels and others who improperly weigh the costs (stock exchange
Energy, oil market, electricity, biomass, gas, coal ...);
would be entrusted with the control of greenhouse gas (national allocation plans,
Trading, Clean Development Mechanism ...) to adequately assess reality
the reduction of emissions. The agency will be equipped with binding powers and
sanctions capacity on the same model as the World Trade Organization;
take over the UN prerogatives Program for Environment (UNEP)
and the Global Environment and become a bridge institution of
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC English)
and the Convention on Biological Diversity,
coordinate the actions of various national agencies where they exist and
stimulate the creation of such agencies where they do not exist.
Extend the emissions trading system
Furthermore, under the aegis of the Agency, the sector CO2 emission quotas system should be
extended to all countries and expanded into new industrial sectors, certain activities of small
and medium enterprises and military activities so that the constraints are
equitably distributed climate policy. Maritime transport should be subject to a system
regulatory and receive Decreasing emissions allowances each year. This can
apply quickly within the European Union, and could then be extended to
international level in the context of negotiations on the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol in
providing for the auctioning of allowances allocated. Proceeds from this auction
must be allocated in priority to the fight against climate change and adaptation
warming. The use propre52 development mechanisms would be strictly limited
in the context of European objectives.
Regulating CO2 quota markets
To make CO2 quota markets effective tools, Ecolo believes it must
strengthen regulation. Such capacity requires more harmonization and centralization
outbreaks of classical monitoring of market functions (infrastructure security,
transparency of information, tracking of dominant positions ...), difficult to implement
52

The international tools in the fight against climate changes are the mechanisms
own development. They target the financing by countries with a numerical target for emissions reduction

under the Kyoto Protocol projects to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in countries without
targets.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENERGY AND CLIMATE - p 24/27

in the European institutional context. But to send a signal to guide
the economy on the target of a reduction by five (or more) of the European emissions
2050, should go further. Ecolo therefore proposes to entrust the Agency with a capacity
intervention and sufficient credibility to change the industrial expectations so they
now realize the investments needed to put the European economy back on track
100% renewable.
Making the energy transition standard
Ecolo also proposes to integrate the energy transition goals and respect for
climate objectives in the selection criteria of the World Bank, the IMF and the Ducroire53,
in favor of renewable energy and energy efficiency and to remove their support
fossil fuels and uranium.
Ecolo finally proposes the deletion of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), too
focused on promoting the use of nuclear energy, and the transfer of skills
nuclear security and non-proliferation to the new UN agency.

Proposal: Frame offsetting emissions
Ecolo proposes to introduce better supervision of clearing agencies
emissions, to verify the reality of compensation and ensure that this tool is used
as a last resort, after the applicant compensation (an individual or a
company) has used all internal solutions to reduce its emissions.
Three major principles should guide the framing:
the harmonization of definitions and messages on voluntary compensation;
rigor and balance, the proposed programs to demonstrate that reductions
emissions they generate are "real, verifiable, additional and guaranteed" and that
their creation, recording and traceability are clearly guaranteed;
the transparency of information on programs through the provision on
a site dedicated portal for this information in a standardized format for the
comparison between operators and their projets54.

53
The National Delcredere Office (www.ondd.be) provides political and commercial risks of Belgian companies in the
mainly non-OECD countries. It sets the intervention ceilings and offers different types of policy to the needs of
the exporter.
54
Ecolo has filed a motion for a resolution to this effect in 2009 (52K2270001) IEW and set up a Charter for
better supervision: http://www.iewonline.be/spip.php?article3317

Environmental Justice
ENVIRONMENT
A safeguarded environment,
wide biodiversity and unspoilt Health
Status and political horizon
State of play
Environmental policy has a special place in the political project of Ecolo. Ecolo has
conducted its first battles in the area of ​​the environment as this issue also plays a
important place in the life of each and every one: the water we consume,
the natural environment in which we live, the air we breathe, the noise around us,
waste management ... we produce our daily rhythm.
The policies in recent years have enabled substantial improvements by
eg on volumes of water purified, on reducing household waste and increasing
selective sorting.
Nevertheless, important challenges remain: biodiversity is continuing its degradation (31% of species
animals and plants are endangered, and 9% have already disappeared), the particles rate
fines in the air remains too high in some places in Wallonia and Brussels, the masses
water are not in good condition and overall ecological footprint remains about 4 times
higher than is sustainable on a global scale. The puncture that is currently operating,
in the mineral and biological resources endangers the common heritage.

The political horizon of Ecolo for the environment
Every day, the citizens, local communities, businesses, actors
civil society make the step towards a mode of consumption or production based more on
respect for the resources we consume. They commit to the ecological efficiency,
lifestyle where quality over quantity, where the richness of nature is respected: as
approaches that contribute to the ecological transition of society. The evolution is on;
Ecolo intends to support all those who contribute to lighten the ecological footprint
our country, to protect health and maintain the biological richness of our planet, with
social concern of access of everyone to the environmental riches.
The need to balance the puncture made by man in nature with the ability of
ecosystems to regenerate: to use an economic metaphor, the human has to live with
interests and not puncture the capital - or, better, heritage - natural. In addition, any
drain on natural heritage turns into rejection that must not be harmful to
ecosystem functioning. Moreover, it is necessary to evolve into an organization where the waste
one is the raw material of the other. In economics, this approach falls within the economy
circular, natural resources operate in a closed circuit.
Environmental justice means that every human being has access to resources
ecosystems and their distribution is fair.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - p 1/32

These principles are available including the following priorities, including proposals
Matches are developed in the "ecological transition of the economy":
organize an economy of functionality, which encourages citizens to use a service
rather than buy an item;
organize a circular economy, which removes waste and makes each own material
to be used by companies or by natural cycles;
expand the supply of green products, by normative, fiscal measures or
awareness;
encourage demand for environmentally friendly products, making them attractive and cheaper.

The Ecolo force lines
To reduce the environmental footprint, each environmental sector must be apprehended with
policy to preserve first, then manage, and repair at last. To an environment
healthy, should be:
Otherwise manage our relationship with nature and resources
-

Making biodiversity a real issue at the international level

-

Preserve and restore biodiversity in Belgium

-

Improve air quality

-

Manage water sustainably

-

Protect and remediate soils

-

Effectively managing waste and resources

Ensuring a consistent policy with respect to various sources of pollution
-

Having an environment free from excessive noise

-

Strictly limit the electromagnetic risk

Reduce the spread of synthetic chemicals
-

Reduce the spread of synthetic chemicals

Improve processes

-

Professionalise environmental management, increase membership and
participation

Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
1. Manage otherwise our relationship to nature and resources

PRIORITY 1: PRESERVING BIODIVERSITY AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL
The decline of biological resources and their intensive exploitation constitute, with
climate change, one of the most serious current threats to humanity1. Both

The World Conservation Union (IUCN) has also recalled in the introduction of the work of its last annual congress in
the fall of 2008 that the "most serious crisis of species extinction since the disappearance of dinosaurs is running" and
In its conclusions, the Millennium Ecosystems Assessment, conducted in 2005 on behalf of the United Nations, stressed
the importance of biodiversity services for the survival of humanity.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - p 2/32

phenomena are also related, climate change is generating major disruptions
Biodiversity (regression of species, natural habitats and changing practices
exploitation, development tropical diseases, emergence of new pests
cultures in more northern areas ...). The decrease in the number of birds and butterflies
in our gardens and bees in apiaries are concrete illustrations.
Ecolo wants Belgium is involved in the dynamics of intergovernmental platform
"IPBES2" which brings together scientific knowledge on biodiversity and translates to
of political action.

Proposal: Refusing the privatization of life and supervise trade
wildlife
Ensuring biodiversity and seeds
Genetic resources belong to the common heritage of humanity. If their access and
sharing must be regulated through the agreements of the Convention on Biological Diversity,
this regulation can lead to their privatization, which reduces the use of the resource
all.
Belgian and European level, the use of farmer seed exchange and seed varieties
must be preserved: promotion of free trade exchanges, registration systems
specific for young and old seed varieties, seed banks creation
Public ...
Ecolo also proposes the recognition of organizations that store and distribute
seeds in the objective of promoting biodiversity and the recognition of the universal right to
reproduce his seed.
Protect wildlife
The Belgian action in the context of CITES3 convention that regulates international trade in
wild species should also be strengthened. The seal hunt should be permitted only
when there is excess (validated by scientific authorities) and in any other circumstances
prohibited. The whaling should be permanently prohibited. The list of species allowed to
marketing in our country must also be updated and reviewed regularly to
avoid introducing invasive alien species.

Proposal: Integrating biodiversity in development assistance programs
The major global reservoirs of biodiversity are found in developing countries,
whose populations are the first victims of the disappearance of the ecosystems
diversified. The objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity should be integrated into
aid policies Belgian and European development, with priority attention to
forest and wetland ecosystems. The resources mobilized for biodiversity protection
must be additional to the budget for development cooperation.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - p 3/32

Proposal: Protecting the world's forests
Worldwide, 80% of the forests that originally existed today disparu4. Their
reduces biodiversity loss and accelerates climate change. Ensure the protection of
So forests is a priority for Ecolo.
In the framework of international climate negotiations, a mechanism to encourage and
"Reward" deforestation reduction actions in tropical countries
development must be put in place. To do this, REDD + should be supported.
In Belgium, the import of illegal timber should be better monitored and prevented; Similarly, all
Governments should only use certified wood.

Proposal: Protecting the oceans, wildlife and marine life
Responsible Fisheries
Fish and aquatic species are now part of the natural resources
threatened. Some scientists predict the total disappearance of wild fish on the horizon
2050. In addition, billions of uneaten fish or other animals (dolphins, turtles,
sharks, birds ...) die needlessly due to the indiscriminate and illegal fishing practices.
In Europe, many wild fish stocks (cod, hake, anchovies ...) are close
of collapse. The reasons for this are diverse, the most important being the undisputed
overfishing.
European fisheries policy has recently strengthened legislation to limit catches,
However this is not enough. By 2015, the EU must put an end to overfishing, to enable
the renewal of stocks by 2020 and maintaining them above levels capable
to achieve maximum sustainable yield (MSY).
Ecolo proposes to support the conversion of fleets to base fishing authorizations
on environmental and social criteria (respect for the marine environment and
workers), to strengthen responsible fisheries, strengthen and harmonize fisheries rules
European and international waters. In this context, the labeling of fisheries products
should reflect compliance with these standards and the origin of the product.
Protect the oceans
The world's oceans, the use and operation are not regulated internationally,
must be the subject of an international treaty. A network of marine reserves should be created on a
area covering at least 40% of the oceans.
Some seabed is rich in minerals. Some are planning to exploit without knowing
the status of biodiversity and ecosystem services they render. It is imperative that before any
mining project, a biodiversity assessment is performed and depending on the result,
the operating license is issued or not.
Finally, the Arctic is highly coveted. Now it is part of fragile ecosystems and delivers
of essential ecosystem services. Belgium should push Europe to achieve status
enhanced protection of this space.

According to FAO, each year, deforestation causes loss of about 13 million hectares of forest, about
25 hectares per minute.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - p 4/32

Proposal: Implement international commitments
biodiversity
The Convention on Biodiversity held in Nagoya in 2010 allowed to adopt a protocol
sharing of genetic resources and a strategic plan for biodiversity called
"Aichi Targets". These are designed to save biodiversity by 2020. The signatory countries
also pledged to protect at least 17% of terrestrial and marine areas 10%
Coastal and 2020, creating networks of protected areas. The progress has been slow.
Belgium has still not ratified the Nagoya Protocol. Ecolo therefore calls without ratification
period and the rapid implementation of commitments.

PRIORITY 2: INCREASE BIODIVERSITY IN BELGIUM
National and regional, biodiversity regression causes are still not
curbed: lack of transversal policies, intensive agriculture, pollutant dispersion,
decline of habitats due to urbanization and erosion ... sols5. In addition, although still
indispensable and too timid, the only political-called "provisional" (creation
protected areas) have now shown their limits. The future must be built in a vision
more dynamic, creative and multifunctional natural areas and their use,
giving increased importance to stakeholders in their management.

Proposal: Develop a coherent and functional ecological network
In the city and in rural areas, it is necessary to boost the development of an ecological network (mesh
green and blue network) including adequate protected sites as well as one-off items (ponds,
natural gardens, green roofs ...) or linear (railway embankments, hedges ...) landscape.
The implementation of the Natura 2000 network has experienced administrative difficulties in Brussels and
Wallonia. It is now time to give a final status and accelerate the adoption of measures
realistic, concerted management and strong enough to restore the state of conservation
habitats and species and ensure the maintenance of the biological quality of each site. For
all protected sites, land tools, such enlargement of legal mechanisms
emption to the benefit of public authorities, should be considered and funding
particular common with a high density of biological landmarks must be
organized.
It should also enhance the Natura 2000 network including educational level,
tourism and increase participation through conservation commissions boost.
Finally, Ecolo wants to develop strategic thinking on public conservation tools. In
Wallonia in particular, a review of existing tools (PCDN, PCDR River Contracts ...) from
in the direction of rationalization and better coordination is especially necessary for
improve efficiency and ease of use. In highly urbanized environments, you must
ensure adequate and equitable supply of natural areas and green spaces, because they
contribute significantly to the quality of life of citizens.
The plan 'nature' of Wallonia must be updated, while in Brussels, "nature plan"
leading in the matter, must be put in execution. It is essential to ensure a place
the protection of nature and biodiversity through all of the Region's policies,
and in a context of demographic pressure.

For the only Wallonia, more than 32% of common bird populations are declining. Report on the state of
Environment Wallon, 2013.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - p 5/32

Finally, it is to involve nature conservation associations in setting
policies and resources in this field and to recognize them as partners in
implementing policies.

Proposal: Extend the base of funding for biodiversity policy
Ecolo will work to develop alternative sources of funding for the benefit of
biodiversity conservation. Walloon Nature Fund to be created for this purpose. In this framework,
be preferred financing environmental services provided by farmers and
forest.

Proposal: Promote local species and valuing nature proximity
Governments must lead an active policy promotion, use and protection
wild native plants on their fields. This policy should primarily
target the areas managed by the SNCB, the regional or municipal public domain, military camps
but also areas of economic activity. Individuals could also make gardens
the subject of more attention, through the promotion of wildlife gardens and natural gardens.
In particular city, awareness of the nature of proximity is a priority for Ecolo, in
including extensive greening of the frame (facades and green roofs with species
native).
Traditional varieties of fruits and vegetables or regional breeds of domestic animals
must be uprated through awareness campaigns, creation of banks
seeds or living conservatories, specialist nurseries ... We must support their registration
European and Belgian catalogs.

Proposal: Fight against invasive species
Globalization, increased trade and climate change lead to
significant increase in the number of invasive alien species in our country. Some
these species prove harmful and can lead to economic losses and problems
public health or undermine the balance of nature. Measures to eradicate
or to slow their expansion must be taken. This happens particularly through action plans
regional and a revision of the Royal Decree on trade in species of fauna and flora
wild to include the most problematic species. Finally, it should involve
owners to contribute to the eradication of these plants.

Proposal: Better supervise the different uses of biodiversity
On hunting
For Ecolo, the practice of hunting is a legitimate activity, since it is practiced in the
concern to ensure game-forest balance and with a desire for restoration and habitat management
(both plain that forest) in favor of biodiversity.
Feeding practices were limited: they should be permanently discontinued
benefit of the quality of the natural environment where the game will find its food. For some
species of small game, the feeding can still be tolerated but should be soon now
limited in time and space on the basis of criteria of wildlife management goals, including
management plans on the basis that ensure quality natural environments will be recreated
to allow the maintenance of a sustainable wild population.
Finally, Ecolo supports the ban of game releases and the definitive abolition of
lead in hunting ammunition and, for all game and in all environments.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - p 6/32

In silviculture
Ecolo intends to continue and strengthen sustainable and multifunctional management policies
forest. In this sense, wants to generalize the Ecolo forestry practices based on the nature and
better integrate the principles of this practice to forest certification schemes (PEFC and FSC).
This silvicultural method should also be subject to increased promotion to
industry professionals. Ecolo supports increased diversification of species,
notably to meet the uncertainties of climate change. Furthermore, Eco
opposes the release into the environment changed silvicultural species genetically.
In terms of agriculture6
With half of the total area of ​​the country that is cultivated, a territorial approach
Agriculture is essential to manage the environmental impacts of this essential activity.
When it is not the fact of organic farmers or farmers working their farm so
extensive, Belgian agriculture - and Walloon - is a more intensive and specialized in Europe:
it is fundamental to reduce the environmental pressures it exerts (water, soil,
biodiversity) but also to significantly improve its positive impact (landscapes, resources
Natural, biodiversity ...).
It is important, in consultation with farmers, some agricultural areas are defined
as "permanent grassland forced", including land erosion risk very high,
floodplains and parcels major issue in terms of biodiversity.
In fisheries
Ecolo intends to support a more ecological management of fish resources. Furthermore proposals
developed earlier in the European framework, Ecolo Belgium intends to act, particularly by
creating zones "sanctuaries" of fishing.
Furthermore, Ecolo wants the fish Fund (financed by the amount of fishing licenses) and
fishing federations support the restoration of spawning areas and the renaturation
rivers, rather than restocking operations.
Ecolo also like to accelerate the pace of implementation of measures to ensure the
free movement of migratory fish in our waters (fish ladders, elimination
some barriers ...) and intends that rempoissonnements are limited to native species.
In beekeeping
The withering away of phenomena of apiaries and bee disappearance are among the
the more diffuse threats and at the same time the most disturbing facing our
environment. Belgium must take urgent preventive measures should also be worn
much greater attention in the future, the pesticide risk assessment for
bees in the authorizations but also invest in more research
about environmental problems facing pollinators. TO
To this end, Belgium should, in particular, integrate into international networks. The beekeeping sector
must be listened to, empowered and recognized field experience. The principles of fight
integrated (drastically reducing the use of pesticides) should apply, particularly on
dependent crops of insect pollination. The Mayan plan must be continued and
strengthened.
About North Sea management
Ecolo is attached to the federal nature of the North Sea. All the inhabitants of our country
have a joint responsibility on the marine environment in which they can "enjoy" and a responsibility
real on environmental impacts which it is exposed due to ongoing releases
water, soil and the atmosphere in Brussels and Wallonia as in Flanders.

See on this subject our proposals in Chapter "Food and Agriculture".

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - p 7/32

For Ecolo, the management of our maritime sector should make it possible to live together, so
sustainable, numerous activities present in this marine area (fishing, mining
mineral resources, tourism, exploitation of renewable energy potential ...) but also
are specific to maintain the natural heritage. A structural diagram was adopted: it must
now form the basis for the management of the North Sea.
About citizens
Finally, it should be continued awareness initiatives conducted in biodiversity
recent years, both in Wallonia and Brussels, and recovery initiatives and achievements
(BiodiBap 'Map Maya, Biodiversity Day ...).

PRIORITY 3: IMPROVE AIR QUALITY
The air is our living environment, it brings oxygen, protects us from the sun's UV rays ...
We must keep it clean and healthy. Yet the air is as natural container residues
of our activities: respiration, but also burning, drying ... The natural cycle manages the flow to
maintain required quality. Human beings have significantly altered the flow setting
because the air quality, and therefore, our health.
In the Brussels region, the air quality has improved in recent years, notably through the
COBRACE7. However, the situation remains unsatisfactory and compliance with certain standards
Europe is still a problem. If there is a series of levers to improve the overall quality
air of the capital, the main node to which the Region is facing to act effectively on
the air quality is that of mobility. Help reduce traffic pressure
automatically improve the quality of air.8
In Wallonia, the 2011 Particle plan was implemented, including through strengthening
the Walloon Agency for Air and Climate (AWAC), and the air quality has significantly
improved. The air-climate action plan should also be continued.

Proposal: Reduce air pollution
In Belgium every year 10,000 people die prematurely because of pollution
air. While some pollutants such as acidifying substances - especially sulfur - are
decrease, background pollution by fine particles and ozone remain a problem.
To improve the situation, Ecolo propose9:
acting locally to bring the concentration of fine particles overruns
below the European level;
to revise downwards, at European level, alert thresholds for certain pollutants such as
and add the fine soot particles are;
to inform the population live on the air quality via pollumètres placed at
strategic locations;
to improve the environmental performance of engines for mobile machinery, machines and
boats currently in circulation and strengthen quality standards for
fuels and fuels;
develop the concept of low émissions10 area. For example, it will be
promote within these areas of type actions Rational Use of Energy,

Much work has been done via the Brussels Code of air, the climate and energy control (COBRACE).

local heat networks, increased pedestrian areas or to encourage
replacement priorities in those areas of captive fleets by weakly vehicles
issuers (see proposal quiet area in the center "noise");
creating a regulatory framework for the olfactory pollution and to be particularly attentive to manage
specific activities that are responsables11.

Proposal: Reduce indoor pollution
To enjoy a quality atmosphere inside buildings, Ecolo offers:
to continue existing measures of preferential financing of environmentally friendly materials
Insulating and implement further concrete measures to reduce
pollution of living spaces, giving priority to schools, kindergartens,
housing and workplaces;
to legislate to set limit values ​​for the main indoor air pollutants
in public and private places;
strengthen diagnosis and remediation of indoor pollution and
to offer all citizens the opportunity to benefit from the intervention of a specialized service
in the detection and response to indoor pollution: the vertes12 ambulances;
increased awareness of how the risk of radon13 and impose measures
adequate to protect themselves in new construction. In particular, it is
implement radon action plan approved by the Walloon Government for the
2013-2016.

Proposal: To eradicate definitively asbestos and compensate victims
Ecolo has mobilized for several years with the victims of asbestos for the creation of a
funds to fully cover medical expenses and compensation for victims
asbestosis. Ecolo ensure the supply of this fund. Ecolo requires allow patients
Lung cancer caused by asbestos to have access, including accepting that
sick people can émarger the fund by expanding the period between
exposure to asbestos and the onset of the disease and finally to enable people
poisoned by asbestos to sue even if they are compensated by the Asbestos Fund.
Ecolo advocates that construction workers are better trained and protected when
perform work in buildings may contain asbestos; and that
Owners are assisted in the removal of asbestos from their homes.
Ecolo finally wants the entry of chrysotile (94% of world asbestos market) in the list
hazardous substances in the Rotterdam Convention, while paving the way for a
global asbestos ban.

10

A low emission zone is a geographically defined area, located in a city, in which among other
a selective admission policy of certain vehicles is applied. The European Commission is currently working on
this, Ecolo wants to expand the current scope of the debate.

PRIORITY 4: SUSTAINABLE WATER MANAGEMENT
The preservation and parsimonious and equitable water management are imperative in politics
Environmental Ecolo. The responsibility of government is even greater than our
regions receive abundant water resources, but they are also thoroughly
used.
Although Belgium has strongly accelerated its compliance within the framework of obligations and
objectives set by the Union européenne14, the effective implementation of district management plans
Hydrographic, which allow to restore good ecological and chemical status for water bodies
(lakes, rivers, ponds ...), are the major issues of the forthcoming years. The impact on health
Public distribution of good quality water is clear.
In this context, coordination within the water sector needs to better optimize skills and
efficiency ; investment in inter-regional and European cooperation must be strengthened,
to carry out the transnational agreements and implement the European commitments
coordinated manner. The transparency of financial flows must be guaranteed. Equal access to water and
a fair price for water must be guaranteed.
Finally, in general, Ecolo proposes the continuation and strengthening of the Alliance jobs -
Environment - "" Water "in the Brussels Region, to stimulate employment and economic activity
in this sector, and its implementation in Wallonia where the potential is important.

Proposal: Guarantee access to water as a fundamental right
Water is a natural resource essential to human beings. This implies that access to water
quality and sufficient quantity should be recognized as a fundamental human right. Management
Water shall keep a public nature, with proper control of democratic power and
citizens.
Ecolo proposes:
generalize the provision of drinking fountains in public spaces;
educate establishments (cafes, restaurants, canteens ...) for the provision

Free tap water for their customers.
At the global level, access to drinking water is far from guaranteed. 2.4 billion people in
are private according to the UN and progress is slow in the countryside, while the water that is drunk
is often dangerous. In a context of increased floods and droughts should be
continue and strengthen projects to hygiene, sanitation and access to clean water
as a fundamental right.

Proposal: To consider water as a vital resource whose purity must
be preserved
Too often, water is regarded as a diluent and fluid waste carrier fluid
then he should be clean, what succeeds very imperfectly to do or great expense. TO
For example, the concentration of drug residues in the Meuse caused a number
overruns of nearly 10% of the target value by substances (potentially) risk
for the production of drinking water, leading to 3000 hours of pumping interruption for
producing water potable15.
For Ecolo requires:

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - 10/32 p

encourage pilot projects to ensure that water and other materials loaded
residues, including drug, are collected separately;
goodbye, at European level, product standards to prohibit the presence of
phosphate in detergents;
support and recognize the many citizens who adopt, voluntarily, of
behaviors and devices to reduce their consumption and limit pollution
Resource: Innovative individual cleansing, dry toilets, adequate valuation
of rain water ...

Proposal: Organize a qualitative and quantitative water management at a cost
fair and solidarity
For Ecolo, pricing of water, if it must comply with the polluter pays principle must
also be based on a principle of solidarity and progressive pricing. The price of water should
cover the services provided to ensure the protection, purification, distribution as well
the collection and treatment of urban waste water. The price per m³ should be following progressive
the amount consumed and integrate the household situation.
It is necessary to control the price of water in its components' production-distribution "and
"Sanitation", taking account of tariff structures which can be different between
Brussels and Walloon regions. The provision of quality water but not necessarily
drinking for some sectors is a necessity.
In the short term, see Ecolo intends to apply the decree on the financing of water policy
Wallonia, which provides a more fair burden sharing between the three main
users: households, industries and farmers. The water funding model to date based
on volumes consumed, must be rethought in order to ensure both the public service and
ensuring affordable load distribution of community infrastructure.
Finally, the cost-truth, based on the polluter pays principle, must answer to
many issues of sanitation-production and distribution cycle.
In terms of production and distribution, intends Ecolo as to avoid any exploitation
abuse of ressource16 including in industries. The regional plan
exploitation of resources, action plan to ensure access to water quality
harmonized manner throughout the territory should be implemented. It is through
this diagram that the concentration of financial resources, further connecting networks,
must lead to improve yields.
It is also necessary to ensure effective protection of catchments by giving priority
More than curative to preventive methods. The measures for nitrates should
also be enhanced through the implementation of the third management program
sustainable nitrogen in agriculture and renforcés17 controls.
For sanitation: the management of domestic and urban waste waters is a
fundamental part of the policy of preservation and improvement of water quality
Surface, groundwater and coastal waters. In Wallonia, Ecologist considers necessary
implement an accelerated manner water purification for
towns with less than 2000 inhabitants. The establishment of sewage channels
efficient for smaller entities should be promoted, taking care to protect
adequately Natura 2000 areas, catchment areas and bathing areas. There
optimal management of storm overflows and the establishment of a register of water discharges
industrial waste are two other essential axes. In the Brussels Region, the

See on this subject our proposals Chapter "Food and Agriculture".

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - 11/32 p

efforts should focus on the renovation of sewer systems and upgrading of
Brussels South station and on flood management.
In Wallonia, for the dispersed and areas where habitat is an autonomous sanitation
Actually, it is necessary to operationalize public services on-site sanitation
Basic efficient and manageable sanitation sectors. The missions
advice, support, control, systems operation and co-financing are
covered by this public service.

Proposal: To ensure the ecological functions of water
To ensure the ecological functions of water, Ecolo means:
further concerted and transversal actions for collective sanitation and
autonomous, stormwater management, soil erosion and livestock access
upstream zones baignade18;
generalize maintenance measures and shoreline restoration using methods
ecological and preventive;
amplify measures to prevent river access to livestock (fences, pumps
nosed for livestock ...) and bank protection by grass strips.
Farmers must be supported in this task;
subordinate border traffic and waterways to protection requirements,
especially in étiage19 period;
develop hydroelectric power (and sometimes geothermal) in good
harmony with other environmental requirements (biodiversity, preservation of
minimum flow, fish ladders, groundwater protection ...). In particular,
develop innovation in the sector, including by recovering energy water
urban waste through heat exchangers to sewer systems;
achieve the designation of new bathing areas in the resulting management plans
the implementation of the Water Framework Directive, the final objective being to be able to swim in
all surface water;
restore urban networks of surface water by ensuring the ecological quality of courses
water and ponds.

Proposal: Preventing and managing floods
For Ecolo, we must implement ambitiously, expeditiously and in consultation between the
different Regions, the European Directive on the assessment and risk management
flood, with particular attention to:
erect, for any soil sealing by urbanization project, systems
Ecological retaining water (storm basin verdurisé, temporary immersion zones
valued at biodiversity level), infiltration on site and if necessary leakage rate
slow, preservation of floodplains to the pool edge in overflow;
establish, in conjunction with card floodplains, measures that must be implemented
work, especially in terms of spatial planning;
propose, in consultation with the insurance companies, a bonus plan that
provides additional guarantees in terms of risk pooling;

Wallonia currently has 37 bathing areas, compliance is not yet fully acquired:
Pollution from livestock, sewage discharges directly into the river, some agricultural practices ...
19
Period where there is little water.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - 12/32 p

implement management plans focused primarily on prevention by
natural methods (fight against soil erosion, equipment that can slow
the flow of rainwater ...), but without forgetting the protection of people,
property and the environment and repair after a flood;
ensure optimal maintenance of streams and infrastructure based on the gradation
local issues, while taking care to limit harm to the ecological quality of courses
water and their surroundings.

PRIORITY 5: PROTECT AND SOIL decontaminate
Soil protection is essential to face various threats to them: erosion,
decrease in organic matter content, sealing, compaction, decreased
biological richness, chemical contamination through industrial and atmospheric pollution.
As long as Wallonia Brussels Region come with legislation
soil decontamination.

Proposal: Establish a strategy to protect and
soil restoration
To maintain a good quality of soil or restore the most degraded soils, it is
essential to know their current status and trends, and the causes of threats
against them. For Ecolo, the strategy should reflect the ambition to maintain soil quality
wherever it is good and improve it in areas where it is weak. She must
allow to develop indicators to assess the current quality of soils and their evolution following
the various measures that have been taken: network and surveillance measures, bank
centralized all analyzes data, digital soil map ... intends Ecolo
to conduct a census of zones free of soil disturbance (old growth), the
risk areas (erosion, reduction in organic carbon content ...) and set goals
fight against these risks.
In Brussels, the inventory of the soil condition has become a reality. The following lists all
land polluted or potentially polluted. Access to information contained in it is open to
all. Continuous updating of this inventory is needed to ensure quality and
update these data. It is also necessary to have them published.
For 2014-2019, it is important to define a strategy to support so
coordinated large-scale pollution.

Proposal: To integrate soil protection into other policies
Preserving soil quality includes agricultural issues such as fertility and erosion
but also health issues of local residents as well as more global environmental issues,
such as climatiques20 changes.
Moreover, erosion and landslides have important consequences when high
rain on downstream areas. Finally, the fight against soil contamination depends on the content of
environmental permits and air quality policies.

20
The loss of soil organic matter (up 40%) causes a clearance C02. The carbon storage
soils therefore solves two issues: to improve the soil structure and the reduction of CO2 in
the atmosphere.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - 13/32 p

In a mutual interest, it is necessary to promote, through legislative measures and
Incentives cross, sustainable land management by farmers, foresters, the
developers and reduce activities at risk of soil pollution. In addition, Wallonia is
littered with old mines, some galleries are crumbling, causing meltdowns
localized courses. They are the owners of the land affected by it. Under
Risk collapse of the basement, it is appropriate to provide a framework to ensure
each security (eg identification of relevant galleries) and provide for the establishment of a
Diet insurance liability.

Proposal: Preserving the natural heritage
Human activities urbanized surfaces prevent water from entering the soil and
nature take its place. The negative effects are a higher water stress with a
greater frequency of flooding, loss of biodiversity, increased heat in the city, a subjective well-being lower than it feels when surrounded by nature.
Water and soil permeability
Any intervention on the scale of the plot which significantly reduces soil permeability and
increases evacuation speed must be the least extent possible and should be accompanied by
measures permeabilization and temporisation21.
Natural heritage
Any intervention that reduces the natural heritage by waterproofing (road, parking, course
building ...), must be offset by measures that restore it or strengthen a
distance close to the area of ​​intervention.
If human intervention waterproofs a protected site or protect, the intervention must be
allowed if any alternative is impossible, the destruction is as low as possible and if the
habitat is destroyed completely replaced.
If the intervention waterproofs banal biotope (unprotected), destruction must nevertheless be
the lowest possible.
The compensation to the intervention is to increase the "rich" other fairly banal or habitats
to reintroduce nature in places which she was excluded. Compensation must
mainly be through investments in nature. If compensation requires
continuous actions to maintain over time, a charitable foundation funded by
developers should be responsible for compliance.
The legislative proposals will have to meet the requirements of administrative simplicity, and they
will achieve easily in a diversified manner and taking into account the ecological network,
permeabilizing the objectives of soil and timing of water flows on the one hand, and
reintroduction of the nature of the other part.

Proposal: To implement the new legislation
Soil Remediation
Ecolo ensure an effective and ambitious application of the Walloon legislation. This is based on
objectives and sanitation procedures that take into account the following principles:
strictly implement the polluter pays principle by requiring the authors of
pollution of the ground support of the removal thereof;

21

A delay measurement is an arrangement that stores rainwater on the parcel, mainly large
rain, and low-flow discharges.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - 14/32 p

apply the principle of using the best available technologies while ensuring
eliminating health risks and environmental present and future;
provide that, for large projects, the completion of a report on the state of the ground when
notarial transaction and ensure, by defining the obligations of the parties, security
Legal in real estate transactions;
comprehensively rehabilitate old or end-of life through taking into landfills
account long-term risks that these sites can generate. The work can not
limited to a simple "encapsulation" or "capping" as practiced in most
of cases;
support the development of contaminated soil processing of new techniques,
including through on-site treatment and bioremediation;
prevent visual pollution sites without simultaneous identification and treatment of
soil pollution.
In Brussels, the order of 5 March 2009 and its implementing decrees bearing fruit in terms
identification of contaminated soil and treatment. However, it appears that these texts should
be adapted in order to reduce the administrative and financial burdens for individuals and
businesses, while maintaining environmental objectives and information.

Proposal: Diagnose contaminated soil and ensure information
of the public
In Wallonia, a comprehensive register of polluted and potentially polluted soil is a priority. he
must be accessible to the public and based on the following methodology:
a leveraging of the principle of proximity and collective memory (eg the
workers) for the location of former and current polluting activities;
cross-checking the information from various authorities (land registry, permits granted ...);
active information of the parties involved prior to any planning, any
project on a fugitive on the ground cadastre about the state of pollution and
traitement22 obligations.
It is also essential to create a right for residents of a polluted site to obtain the realization of
soil testing campaigns on their land, even an analysis of their health. In some
areas, a long-term monitoring is required.

PRIORITY 6: EFFECTIVELY MANAGE RESOURCES AND WASTE
With the development of reuse and recycling, waste management is a
opportunity to develop the economy, create jobs and protect
the environment. The waste policy must imperatively respect a hierarchy
mobilization of different treatment methods: prevention, which involves the
modifying our patterns of production and consumption; preparing for re-use;
the recycling ; other valuations, including energy; the friendly disposal
the environment. This policy must gradually move towards a resource policy.

22

This applies particularly in Wallonia where SPAQUE mainly communicates in crisis and difficulty
transmit the results of the studies it performs.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - 15/32 p

Proposal: To give priority to prevention
It is necessary to reduce both the quantities - only for food packaging, more than two
thirds are for single use - that the hazardous waste. To do this, Ecolo offers:
to conduct an assessment of the effectiveness of prevention policies;
strengthen awareness campaigns to eco-consumption and against waste,
including information on waste in each container yard;
to promote composting at home and the neighborhood level;
to limit the distribution of advertising-to-door and prohibit postal packages
Non-recyclable;
submit generating companies to packaging reduction targets;
to act against all sales practices that encourage wasteful consumption.

Proposal: End the programmée23 obsolescence and facilitate
the recycling
The vast majority of human achievement have a lifetime or limited use, we do
not manufacture for eternity. This is what observation was born the concept of "cradle to cradle" or
"Cradle to cradle": since there is a purpose of use, especially designed for their goods
each constituent materials can be completely reused in the technological cycle or
into the organic cycle. Given that the focus is on upstream work with industry, the
best waste is that which is not produced, Ecolo intends to promote this approach.
That said, accept that our achievements are of limited duration does not mean that this
can be programmed obsolescence. The planned obsolescence corresponds to an end use
thought by the manufacturer in the interests of increasing consumption.
To eliminate planned obsolescence, Ecolo proposes a set of mesures24:
extend the warranty period without requiring the consumer to pay a contribution
extra for this service;
create a possibility for every consumer to report cases of obsolescence
programmed products;
require manufacturers and / or vendors to display shelf life or use of the products,
availability of spare parts over the lifetime announced to file manual
maintenance and repair in a database to prevent the placing on the
market non removable devices, to display at the point of sale the number of camera
and the service life of wearing parts and their prices.

Proposal: Valuing local employment fields in the repair,
rental and réemploi25
Public authorities should support the emergence of new local services
allow to repair, reuse, adapt objects to technological developments, rent or
share instead of buying them.
Ecolo will promote the development of ressourceries to recycling centers and
reuse stores, and supporting players active social economy in this sector because

they also contribute to the training, re-employment and integration of some workers
qualified or in trouble. Flea markets and initiatives such as the "fairs expertise"
should also be encouraged.

Proposal: Reduce the production of household waste
By various methods, the Walloons have reduced production of raw household waste
350 kg / capita / year to about 170 kg / capita / an26. The objective is to gradually achieve a goal
average of 100 kg / capita / year in 2018.
The largest share of these gross household refuse (OMB) is represented by waste
fermentescibles27 (over 40%), followed by several recyclable waste and waste kg
preventable. The Brussels meanwhile produce more than 300 kg per capita per year. Since
few years, some municipalities have achieved average yields of 90 kg / capita / year
raw garbage, and in particular by the introduction of a fee proportional to the weight and
establishment of separate collection of organic waste that captures an average production
40 kg / capita / year, recoverable biomethanation.
In Brussels, Ecolo wants to pursue the establishment and effective functioning of the contribution
on the quantities of household and similar waste, collected in the territory by the Region
Agency Brussels-Cleanliness and municipalities to encourage Cleanliness Brussels, the
municipalities and the Region to develop the means necessary for achieving the objectives
European collection and recycling. A solidarity pricing, which integrates including
household size, must be provided.

Proposal: Increase the recycling of certain critical materials
Our company is facing depletion of certain materials, especially certain lands
rare (rare metals group) which are essential in the manufacture of technological devices.
Ecolo proposes that by 2018, at least 80% of the most critical materials come from
recycling (urban mining). Ecolo offers better support SMEs entrusted with that task,
by providing an operational handbook of best practices for major
types of waste, strengthening the role of itinerant prevention advisors, and grant
aid for research for the optimization of raw material flows.

Proposal: Achieving optimum selective collection of waste
To optimize the sorting scheme, Ecolo offers:
supporting selective collection of kitchen waste and garden or composting
home, in order not to have organic raw garbage in the garbage cans. Of
collection devices, specific to very dense residential areas and communities,
must be implemented;
to extend the selective collection of paper and cardboard PMC door to door to all
packaging waste, and, for businesses that put the packages on the
market (see below: better manage the back obligations);
improve coverage of the territory by landfills and container parks,
especially in the Brussels Region;
facilitate access to deposit recovery firms to economy enterprises
active in social reuse or ressourceries (demolition sites, parks
containers ...) with specific attention to the demolition materials;

Wastes consisting solely of biodegradable organic matter.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - 17/32 p

better monitoring of waste management in the sectors that generate the most.

Proposal: Expand and better manage back obligations
The take-back obligation incumbent on producers of certain products. It is to recover
goods (packaging, tires, batteries, electrical and electronic equipment, oil ...) they put in

sale, when they reach the end of life and to ensure their recycling or disposal. This
device however poses revenue control problems and costs as well as
Verification of the final destination of waste. It also has recovery rates
sometimes too low. Ecolo wants to change the system of obligations for:
extend the recovery obligation to other end of life assets;
ensure effective control by the regions, with a Master on revenue
Important generated by these systems and the expenses arising therefrom;
increase the number of collection and recycling rates charged to certain waste,
especially plastics, and in specific sectors such as Horeca. This
particularly concerns Fost +;
provide or develop the component "prevention" of environmental conventions or plan
Individual companies relating to take-back obligations;
undergo back obligation dangerous products; financed by bonds
recovery selective collection, including the garbage selective collection in places
public.

Proposal: Increase the share of returnable packaging, including cans
beverages
Cans and other beverage containers pose a significant public cleanliness issues
and the collection system is inadequate to respond. Their removal is very expensive for
municipalities. To remedy this, Ecolo proposes to introduce a deposit on drink cans and
to gradually expand to other packaging. A study in this direction showed that
to be justified and effective, the system had to be conducted in the three Regions or
better at European level.

Proposal: Reduce the environmental impact of processing and
waste disposal
Landfilling and incineration pollute and are losing valuable materials. In Ecolo there
must end the dumping of organic materials of all recoverable waste
and all industrial waste (non-hazardous). It should also end
incineration of organic materials of all recyclable waste, and all waste
industrial (OIW) in bulk.
Ecolo proposes to generalize biomethanation and composting of organic waste
(green waste and kitchen waste) to ensure the closure of the cycle of organic matter and
naturally limit emissions of greenhouse gases. To do this, the collection is
essential. It is also important to have well distributed on the biométhaniseurs
territory.
Given the incineration overcapacity in Wallonia, Ecologist proposes to delete the subsidization of
incineration and to subsidize 45% of the biogas plants to a
Regional quota set by the Region in terms of optimal geographical distribution.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - 18/32 p

Like Wallonia, we must consider funding the production of gas from the
biogas in the Brussels Region.
For wastes that still must be incinerated, increase yields
energy recovery and study the potential development of a heat network
proximity. It should also promote the development of DIB recovery sectors,
also create jobs.
Ecolo also proposes that the ban incineration of household waste at home or
better communicated to citizens and be the subject of reinforced controls.
In Brussels, an effective policy of waste reduction would reduce the number of
necessary furnaces. Incinerator capacity must be progressively reduced and
remuneration of the operator to be reviewed depending on the amount of waste incinerated. It should
also consider a direct operational use of infrastructure by the Region.

Proposal: Improve the governance of waste management
Wallonia:
The presence of numerous management operators generate competition between them, each
operator seeking above all to better use its own facilities. This has
financial consequences for both common and for the citizen. It is therefore appropriate to
primarily develop cooperation between operators and apply a pricing
unique regional. To do this, regional supervisory mechanisms must be strengthened and
the regional authority must intervene to regulate inter-operators.
In this context, Ecolo proposes to create a stronger regional authority may take the
as a waste management public body. This body would have imperative force
define the type of waste treatment facility in accordance with the Walloon Waste Plan and
strict hierarchy of treatment. Effective and collaborative partnerships with operators
private should be developed and the scope of public action / Private better defined and delimited.
The current system to encourage work and investment in the joint
intercommunal (decompartmentalisation system) leads to a double subsidization (each
intercommunal receives 5% of subsidies and more as it enters the system). Ecolo offers
to change this system by removing the double subsidization so that each investment made
Public subsidization enjoy additional 5% (rather than each
intercommunal).
Ecolo finally proposes to implement an Employment Alliance - Environment - "and Resources
waste ", like the Brussels Region.
In Brussels :
Ecolo proposes to develop a cost-Truth waste system, distinguishing the craft of
cleanliness of, the collection and treatment of waste. This system should lead to a
cost transparency.
It should also strengthen the partnership with the actors re-use, notably via
Employment Alliance - Environment - "Waste".

Proposal: Adopt a public cleanliness strategy
Safety in public space is a source of tension, insecurity and discomfort for
many citizens. For this reason, improving public cleanliness must be a priority.
The policies in this area should be coherent and be based on equity shares and
reflection on the notion of "public cleanliness", with neighborhood associations.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - 19/32 p

Ecolo proposes to develop clean public policy and for this conduct:
primary prevention (which prevents the gesture of throwing), by discouraging packaging
Disposable (set) and by mapping blackheads to manage
secondary prevention and where to strengthen efforts;
secondary prevention, promoting citizen adoption of socially places
empty and transforming them into places of conviviality or closing, reducing
bins of holes for the drop-off or removing those that can not
not be subject to social control, with means for monitoring and sanction
(administrative fines ...) and in the extent possible by replacing the fine by
community work cleaning interest (awareness), educating according to
effective approaches (see the theories of commitment and of reasoned action);
effective remediation by a cleanup strategy by giving a status less
precarious and visibility to clean agents, by removing waste or via tags
of those responsible for community service, organizing operations
clean with residents (roadside) and creating collaborations with
population to clean their neighborhood.

2. Ensuring a coherent policy in relation to various sources of pollution

PRIORITY 7: HAVE A QUIET
Prevention is the best course of action to reduce the most gênantes28 noise.
Referring to the WHO recommendations, the objective is to reduce Ecolo from the
population exposed to noise levels above 55 dB (A) while ensuring the greatest
number a maximum background noise by 35 dB (A) and levels not exceeding 45 dB (A) at night in
the rooms. If the Brussels Region already has modernized legislation, it is appropriate
to adopt a more restrictive legislation Wallonie29.

Proposal: To adopt a stricter European framework for the fight against
the noise
The actuelle30 European legislation includes general objectives, as set
currently, are difficult to evaluate. Indeed, the legislation does not provide limits
noise in decibels that would constitute yet measurable and specific goals. Ecolo
proposes that such values ​​are defined, in the form of target values ​​and limit values
in front :
be based on the latest WHO recommendations;
take into account the specificities of vulnerable and sensitive areas
(such as schools, residential areas, etc.);
be developed so as to limit the noise of specific sources (noise
road, air and rail in particular);
take into account the frequency and intensity of the peaks or unique sound events
which can be particularly problematic.

28

In the Netherlands for example, through prevention policies, the share of the population exposed to noise levels
annoying (above 55 dB) is much lower than in Belgium (43% against 70%).
29
Ecolo has filed a proposed decree on the fight against noise pollution.
30
END directive 2002/49 / EC.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - 20/32 p

Ecolo therefore requested to incorporate the legislation clear, measurable and binding, which
apply throughout the European territory, giving all citizens the same level of
protection.

Proposal: Limit the noise at source
Car traffic is the main source of noise. The decrease in traffic, the reduction of
speed roads and amenities strongly reduce. Ecolo offers
also reduce the levels of noise emissions of equipment (engines and vehicles,
rolling stock of public transport but also mowers, MP3 players, air conditioners,
quads ...) reinforced by standards of products. In February 2013, the European Parliament has weakened
the vehicle noise standards: Ecolo wants to return to the Commission's proposals
more severely reduced vehicle noise.
Ecolo proposes to systematically integrate the variable "noise" in any implementation project and
Urban or rural planning. Ecolo also proposes to consider this issue in the granting of
environmental permits (especially for movie theaters and discos).
As in the Flemish Region, and like some actors already applying this limitation,
Ecolo proposes to set a noise limit in some places (evenings, cinemas) by setting thresholds
sound levels in particular to prevent the risk of tinnitus.

Proposal: To assess the levels of noise and implement reduction plans
noise
The cadastral noise provided by européenne31 Directive must be made quickly
possible. However, this directive is not binding and significant noise sources
beyond the mandatory register. The most significant noise sources including blackheads
road and motorway, should be prioritized and action plans evaluated regularly
to fully measure the impact of actions taken. Ecolo proposes to develop relay
mediation at the local level (municipalities, police, community groups, neighborhood mediators ...).

Proposal: Reduce aircraft noise
Ecolo meant to be guaranteed the fundamental right to rest and sleep all citizens.
Thus, like Charleroi airport, Ecolo wants Brussels National Airport is
closed at night, between 23 hours and 7 hours.
Meanwhile, Ecolo defends a noise and risk reduction policy
avoiding overflying the more densely populated areas. Indeed, the desire to expose the least
people as possible the risks and air traffic nuisance is a natural application of
principle précaution32. Specifically, Ecolo request that the situation of residents and
victims of aircraft noise in the immediate or more distant to be heard around airports
and that answers will be made on the basis of objective criteria. Thus, the trajectories must
take into account the population density of the areas flown over to expose the least
people as possible, and the costs of expropriation or home insulation (which excludes
densely populated areas). Ecolo finally proposes to ban the construction of new
homes in areas near airports which are the most exploited.

31

Directive 2002/49 / EC on the assessment and management of environmental noise.
In the Brussels-Capital Region, 12.6% of the population is subject to a yearly average noise levels of aircraft
greater than 55dB (A) threshold for a severe nuisance is felt.

PRIORITY 8: STRICTLY LIMITED TO THE RISK ELECTROMAGNETIC
Proposal: To guard against risks of electromagnetic radiation
The risk level of electromagnetic radiation is extremely controversial. The
financial interests at stake are substantial, both on the part of those who wish admit
high rates (especially for sell existing devices and networks) that those who wish
restrict rate (which would include new GSM markets). To define
these risks, Ecolo requires experiments to strict protocol (independence, doubleaveugle ...) are carried out to determine the risks.
To better guard against risks linked to electromagnetic radiation, Ecolo offers:
foster optical fiber telecommunications to the housing and
wired networks in buildings rather than over the air and to avoid duplication
between wireless telecommunications networks;
implement a standard term that ensures the best consideration of
precautionary principle. This standard should allow everyone from being exposed to any
time to electromagnetic radiation than 3V / m cumulative;
to encourage phasing out 2G and 3G, those efficiency
lowest spectral. Moreover, it must cover the territory enough Antenna
in order to reduce their power. Governments have the obligation to promote
reception antennas on their roofs if they are not near places
stay sensitive public;
to identify the operators of their total obligation to cover the territory and
encourage the sharing of networks among operators;
to make an order based on legislation that imposes product standards
of more stringent emission standards for emitters
Electromagnetic (WiFi, WiMax, Bluetooth, mobile phone ...), in particular to avoid
all without consent from the exhibition neighborhood and to require, at
European, that communicating devices have a possibility to wire bonding and
not only by electromagnetic waves;
make clear labeling of effective emission level electromagnetic waves
and to mandate the sale of headsets;
to put in place measures to ensure that the most fragile and the most sensitive are
particularly taken into account and protected. We are thinking here particularly to children
and young, sick, treatment or elderly, pregnant women and
hyper electro-sensitive people. Epidemiological studies are needed
by independent and funded by government experts;
to adopt a moratorium on WiFi installations in establishments open to the public,
especially to children (nursery and primary schools, hospitals, libraries, homes,
nurseries ...) and wired solutions for connections to the Internet; in the meantime,
should at least ensure the presence of preserved places of waves in
public services (hospitals, government offices, trains ...) to account for persons
hyper Electro-sensitive;
formally recognize the electro-sensitivity as a public health problem,
to help people with cancer to find effective medical treatment and
protect their home and their workplace;
to provide for the placement of a clear symbol to announce publicly the presence in
near a public issuer of electromagnetic waves (WiFi, WiMax, DECT, relays
GSM ...);

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - 22/32 p

organize the withdrawal from the market of DECT phones, the base emits
maximum power, even in the absence of appeal, and whose power emission
handset and its base is not reduced to its lowest level, while allowing
good communication;
to promote information and awareness campaigns among citizens - and
especially young people - about the danger of the intensive use of GSM (and other devices
emitting electromagnetic waves);
to establish a code of conduct on the advertising plan for GSM and
wireless technologies. In particular, ban advertising to encourage families
remove their fixed line in favor of GSM.

PRIORITY 9: LIGHT POLLUTION REDUCTION
Today, studies show that 30 to 50% of the light produced by the outside lighting
is sent to the sky, in vain. Ecolo wants to tackle this waste of energy. It
also reduce this form of pollution impacting the fauna, flora and observation
the night sky. Initiatives have already been taken to modernize the old public lighting
but no legislation exists to limit pollution caused by light, neither Wallonia nor
in Brussels, while others such as the Czech Republic, Slovenia, France, Italy, the
Canary Islands and Catalonia have legislated on the matter.

Proposal: Enlighten better and limit light intrusion
Exterior lighting must be improved not only by replacing inefficient bulbs
by much cheaper bulbs, but also in designing a lighting aiming
only the area to be illuminated. Thus, the lighting above the horizon should be prohibited, except for
air markup for example, the light intrusion into the narrow housing, and lighting
public much better directed to the areas to be illuminated. The reduction of light intensity
overnight should be made possible, while ensuring a very good security in public places.

Proposal: Identify areas of low illumination, tell Protection
In non-urban areas and significant natural interest, it should be possible to limit
night lighting drastically to limit the impact on flora and fauna on the night. he
here must remember that the majority of living biomass is nocturnal and diurnal not, and that in these
natural protected areas, it may be desirable to prohibit any form of outdoor lighting
During the night. This should also help to ensure good conditions for stargazing
in some places.

Proposal: To regulate LED screens for advertising and public display
LED advertising screens are sometimes dazzling and may endanger road safety. There are
therefore necessary to regulate their use and location to improve road safety and
avoid glare.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - 23/32 p

3. Reduce the spread of synthetic chemicals

PRIORITY 10: REDUCE THE SPREAD OF CHEMICALS
SYNTHESIS

Proposal: To control chemicals
Ecolo calls for flawless application and strengthening of the European REACH Regulation
(Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical substances) in all
the sector. REACH requires companies that manufacture and / or import products
Chemical to demonstrate that their substances are safe for the environment and health. This
Regulation is an opportunity to seize as accelerator for innovation and research, in order
the creation of a real sector verte33 chemistry.
Moreover, while nanotechnology and nano-products can represent an opportunity, they
can also pose serious risks to the environment and human health:
precautionary principle should be implemented. Ecolo wants a ratio of at least 5% is reached
between applied research and research impacts34. Like GM, before the placing on
the market for these products, serious studies proving their safety and showing interest
societal must be conducted.
Finally, it is necessary to reduce our exposure to endocrine disruptors (phthalates,
Bisphenol A ...). Belgium can, like France, anticipate EU decisions
extending the ban on bisphenol A in all food packaging, and support
active at European level a comprehensive strategy to reduce disruptive
Endocrine. Other micro-pollutants such as residues of drugs and substances
Hormonal must be a strategy to prevent dispersal in the environment.

Proposal: Continue to reduce the use of pesticides
In 2013, the Federal Government and the Regions have adopted plans to reduce the risks
related to the use and consumption of pesticides. For Ecolo, it should go further and:
replace the advertising for these products through precise information on the conditions
Product use;
enforce and strengthen existing rules on labeling;
submit substances placed on the market for chronic toxicity tests and to
assessment of their cumulative effects. This includes the risk to bees and
other insect pollinators is evaluated and reduced. The moratorium must neonicotinoids
be extended to any use throughout the année35 and be extended for a period of two
years is insufficient to see the effects;
prohibit their self-service sales. They should only be issued upon request by
persons with specific training and Agréation;
primarily regulate and eliminate biocides, wood treatment products,
household insecticides and products for gardening;

33
By green chemistry, chemistry is meant that share of resources from the photosynthesis, which does not manufacture or used
dangerous products.
34
In Germany it is 5% in Europe 1%.
35
Currently, a moratorium on néonocotinoïdes exists for two years and concerns only sowing in certain periods
the year of some seeds coated with neonicotinoid.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - 24/32 p

make Brussels a Region without pesticides and progressively banned in Wallonia
pesticide use and delineate the very short term, in Wallonia, agricultural areas
the use of pesticides is prohibited, such as the edges of waterways, buffer strips
near schools and kindergartens, and some very exposés36 subdivisions.

4. Improving processes

PRIORITY 11: professionalise ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,
INCREASE MEMBERSHIP AND PARTICIPATION
The report maintains that the human with nature, consider living differently
in the manipulation: an animal ethics must be developed and the living being deserves
respected for himself. In addition, we have a responsibility to the "common property"
the environment, which we have to survive for future generations.

Proposal: Promote the participation of all to protect
the environment as a common good
Ecolo proposes to improve the participation of the environmental community, in particular
improving how to conduct public inquiries (document readability, animation
meetings and conduct of the investigation process by an independent third party, adequate display and duration,
Notice of public hearing ...), and by setting up support committees within
which the operating rules and citizens' rights are clearly defined. In
particularly for impact studies, wishes Ecolo in Wallonia, as is practiced
Brussels, an accompanying committee can be created and can accompany the realization
even the impact assessment. It should also modernize the participation, inventing
new forms of animation (ask ...), consulting (Internet). The song
Environmental are natural intermediary between the citizen and the political: they
bring together citizens and formulate expectations. These NGOs, whether local
or apex, must be heard and associated with the process.

Proposal: Strengthen and streamline the licensing arrangements
Environmental and Punishment of Crimes
The fight against pollution requires strengthening and proper functioning of the main tool
the hands of public authorities: the system of environmental permits. This fixed regime
Release regarding quality standards allowed for air, water, waste and various ...
conditions to be met.
For Ecolo, we must improve the functioning of the chain of control activities and
Punishment of Crimes. Too few operators are controlled and when they are, too little
offending procedures lead to a sanction, whether judicial or administrative. Ecolo
therefore wishes to expand and strengthen the scope of administrative fines, professionalize
contrôle37 care services and increase the number of officers assigned there, empower
local authorities and organize systematic controls by industry.
For the sake of prevention, transparency and availability of information relating to permits
must be strengthened to the population. As such, Ecolo wants to see happen regime

Including environmental police.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - 25/32 p

Emission Register under which the largest companies discharges must be compiled,
controlled and made public.
In Brussels, for projects that involve both the planning and the environment, offers Ecolo

to establish a single environmental permit-planning rather than permit procedures
separate and parallel.

Proposal: To promote the professional management of the environment
Public authorities must set an example by managing and reducing their impact
Environmental professionally. Ecolo believes that all public structures
regional and community must have an environmental management system type
ISO 14000 or better EMAS38. Ecolo also like to encourage small companies to join
professionalisation.
Businesses and other non-public structures should also be encouraged to manage
environmental impacts professionally. To accelerate this movement, Ecolo
proposes to develop a Walloon regional label, identical to the Brussels label "Eco-dynamic company". In Brussels, Ecolo proposes that improved the possibility of moving the label
"Eco-dynamic company" on ISO 14000 and EMAS certification.

Proposal: To support environmental NGOs and citizen action
In Brussels, Ecolo obtained the realization of a stable funding framework,
Multiannual and independent for environmental associations through a prescription.
The resources allocated to this policy must be maintained and an easing of terms
Accreditation under the order should allow an association to be approved to more
themes.
In Wallonia, it is appropriate to implement the decree of recognition and funding
environmental voluntary sector, while respecting the principles of independence that must govern
the relationship between government and NGOs.
Citizens need to be supported in their participatory approach, accessing easily
information, having the time to give their opinion and being aware of how
the authority has given their opinion.

Proposal: Develop an information policy
We are all increasingly subjected to beatings advertising. Given their
purchasing power and their influence on consumption of their parents, young people deserve
particulière39 attention. Ecolo means:
establishing an observatory on advertising and regulate commercial advertising, in particular to
restrict advertisements for products harmful to the environment. Furthermore, the Jury
advertising ethics (EHD) is the body "self-discipline" of advertising in Belgium. This
jury is composed predominantly of advertising. It is therefore both judge and party. We
hope that a real regulatory body be institutionalized. This body should be
made democratically and should be considered are representatives of organizations
young, consumer advocates and protection associations
the environment ;

38

Emas, European regulation, is ISO 14000 to which are added the participation of workers and
transparency of information for everyone.
39
A series of other proposals are also made in the Chapter "Culture and media".

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - 26/32 p

restrict advertising in public spaces and services and gradually discouraged,
or even prohibit, the panels need electricity;
make positive campaigns promoting eco-consumption.

Proposal: Develop analysis of ecosystem services and have
regional expertise
Compared to his need to satisfy, humans can use different techniques, which have
each environmental impact. Legislation (authorization or taxation) can
orient certain techniques. The European Commission wants the policy choices
environmental and economic is based on a preliminary analysis of services by rendus40
ecosystems, which shows that ecosystem protection is beneficial. Some
countries and regions are very advanced in this area.
Ecolo proposes creating a center of expertise in Wallonia and Brussels. This service will be able to
document and evaluate the services provided by ecosystems and the impact of a policy
on the services provided by ecosystems. In 2020, Wallonia and Brussels will
have a complete environmental accounting based on ecosystem services,
allows to guide the decision. For Ecolo, the analysis of ecosystem services must not be
synonymous with monetization of nature, a multi-criteria analysis can deliver results all
also interesting.

Proposal: Develop the link between environmental protection and
the health
Our company is facing new health issues multifactorial: Sensitivity
extreme of the embryo and fetus to chemicals, involvement of chemicals
very small doses at the onset of disease under chronic toxicity, increased
cancers "environmental", infertility, allergies ...
Alongside environmental measures detailed in this chapter, stresses Ecolo
the importance of guiding the development of research, medical practice and politics
public health into consideration environmental factors preventively,
particularly in the Cancer Plan and the Action Plan for chronic diseases.
More concretely, Ecolo offers:
to set up a register of sanitary and epidemiological data. It must lead
to an array of environmental health indicators-edge easily searchable by
public and professionals. It will also be used as a tool by the
authorities responsible for the remediation of polluted sites and the issuance and control
environmental permits;
protect 'whistleblowers';
to develop a bio-monitoring system around the areas to environmental risk.
Ecolo proposes the creation of a body to measure the exposure of the population to
different pollutants and make any recommendations necessary for their protection.
More generally, Ecolo believes that the answer to these new public health issues and
degradation of the living environment is the fight against all pollution.

40

As companies and institutions, ecosystems provide us with services that allow us to satisfy our
needs. Indeed, it is mainly the ecosystems that give us our clean air, our water, our
food ... These are both service production and regulation. Ecosystems also provide us
less tangible but nonetheless real services such approval (a beautiful landscape ...), cultural heritage (of a tree
remarkable …).

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - 27/32 p

Proposal: Recognize and support environmental education and
sustainability
Public investment in support for bodies active in education on
Environment should continue with a permanent concern for efficiency, consistency
Geographic and indépendance41.
In Brussels, the political awareness and education on the environment Brussels
Environment has produced results and should be continued. For Ecolo, it must nevertheless
leave more room for associative initiative.
In Wallonia, an awareness and education strategy on environment remains
to build. The operation, missions and efficiency of the network of regional centers
Environmental Information (CREE) should be evaluated in the context of strengthening
of their public interest missions. Grants to civil society actors should be
articulated with the missions of CREE, so as to avoid dispersion and duplication but
also to enable wider coverage of the territory, thematic and
trades.
Public investment is not limited to support associations active in education at
Environment (ERE) but to have an EE program to academic and extracurricular circles, youth and adults. The process of Audience ErE / DD to school, initiated
during the 2009-2014 term, allowed the meeting between the academic world, political
Brussels and Walloon regional and community initiatives. He initiated a process of
awareness of the school community to the exercise of activity of EE / SD, in the framework of the implementation
implement its educational missions. This process must be continued and reinforced its results.
The recognition of EE / SD as discipline goes further by integrating it into
higher education and professionalizing. In this regard, it will place:
to support research in environmental education and sustainable development,
particularly by incorporating it in the first of five priority strategic themes
(Sustainable Development) defined by the Government of the Federation Wallonia-Brussels
(Search Strategy 2011-2015);
to create a specialized university-level degree in Education on
Environment and Sustainable Development;
to integrate education on environment and sustainable development in the
core curriculum for students teachers, educators and AESI42 and in training
continued teacher;
to recognize and accept the formation of "Nature Guide".
Specific support should be given to both environmental education actors as
actors of social assistance that sensitize the public to environmental issues or use
nature and the environment as a means of emancipation.

Proposal: Develop an ethics of human-animal relationship
Is not about morality in human societies, the animal is the object and we
duties to him. This implies a respect for living conditions and death worthy of a
human ethics, whether an annuity animal, company or laboratory. Ecolo
recognizes the animal's status to be sensitive.
The ethics that should exist between man and the animal is regularly flouted. Nowadays, the
relationship between man and animal is too often characterized by outrageous exploitation
41
42

See on this subject our proposals in Chapter "School".
Aggregation of lower secondary education.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter ENVIRONMENT - 28/32 p

the latter by the former, especially in the excesses of the food industry and
pharmaceuticals.
On another level, the consumer society in which we operate also tends to value
the unexpected and dramatic. This leads to the strengthening of trade of exotic animals
wild. This trade represents a significant threat to the survival of many species
and it must be regulated and controlled.
The 1986 law on animal welfare, which is the legislative basis of animal welfare in our
countries must be constantly strengthened and amended to meet the new expectations and
realities of our society in its relationship with the animal.
In this context, it should:
provide for a gradual phasing out of animal testing, in areas where
the contribution in terms of public health is lower (cosmetology, for example).
Experiments using primates should be prohibited and combated throughout the
world ;
ban all production and trade of animals raised for fur. The only
Fur acceptable is one that falls within the recycling skins from animals having been
slaughtered for meat consumption. No livestock can not be tolerated for
fur ;
improve living conditions and transport of farm animals. The principle of
proximity between breeding place and the place of slaughter should guide the development and
strengthening of existing legislation;
continue to strengthen the framework for the breeding and keeping of animals to new
Company (NACs).

FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
After the circuitscourts healthy diet, the heart of the ecological transition
Status and political horizon
State of play
Globally, food production patterns through the upheavals without
Previous: abrupt changes in commodity prices, food riots in various
countries, increased competition for access to arable land, land confiscation and / or expulsion of
peasants, droughts, loss of biodiversity, loss of confidence in safety and transparency
the food chain ... The causes are multiple: low stocks, rising
production costs related to changes in the prices of fossil energy, financial speculation on
food markets, the increased demand but also the role of producer
Emerging countries like India and China, diets changes, the
uncontrolled development of biofuels that increase speculative interest on
raw materials and deforestation, climate change, etc. To this list have
added of difficult to control health problems such as avian influenza or
increased resistance to antibiotics.
Ironically, while raw materials are the object of speculation in the markets and
prices are soaring, farmers are getting more than just remuneration that takes account of
actual cost of production and especially in the developing countries where poverty strikes and workers
agricultural workers in our regions, as recently illustrated the milk crisis and
beef.
The productivist agricultural policy over the last fifty years has created
inequalities globally, destroying many rural jobs. In this model,
moyen1 the farmer is endangered: the farm must either grow and marry
industrial model, or find a niche or exercising supplementary basis. It's all a know-how and jobs associated with it, which are threatened.
Thus, over the period 2000-2009 in the 27 member countries of the European Union, 25%
agricultural employment has disappeared. This corresponds to the loss of 3.7 million full-time jobs, while
Europe counts 23 million unemployed. In Wallonia, the INS estimated that the number 4002
farms have disappeared over the period 2002-2009, causing the loss of 6111 jobs, including
6033 full time.
Intensive agriculture also contributes to the depletion and degradation of natural resources
(including soil and water) and to a significant loss of biodiversity. New issues
public health have emerged: the north that is not nourished sufficiently balanced sees
develop diseases related to feeding such as obesity; South sees its farmers
affected by famine.

This policy is also blamed for his contribution to emissions of greenhouse
(20% of total emissions) 2, in particular meat production, since 80% of the land
agricultural devoted to it, directly or indirectly. An awareness of the need for
gradual reduction in meat consumption across the globe appears so
unavoidable in the context of a struggle against the climatique3 warming policy.
This model does not respond to a food security imperative, since wide
globe are nearly two billion people suffer from malnutrition, 842 million which
chronically hungry and nine million people die of hunger each year. There
Hunger is the leading health risk in the world and it affects mostly countries
development, particularly in rural areas and therefore paysans4.
An agricultural model, based on competitiveness and on trade material
first cheap, is no longer tenable. Indirect costs of production-agribusiness
are very important for collectivité5 while its benefits are even more concentrated
in the hands of a few large transnational groups. This trend towards the standardization of
agro-industrial model worldwide and the concentration of resources in a few
large private actors, is reinforced by global agreements on the liberalization of
trade.
In this model, the circuit between the field and the plate are of increasing length: products
food are becoming more km before consumption, and intermediaries are increasingly
and more. In this context, the search for maximum profit and the desire to reduce
certain costs to increase margins pulled the quality of agro-industrial products down:
less nutrients, less variety, less taste, more preservatives and pesticides. A
evolution not without consequences on public health and the environment.
At the European level
In 2013, the European Union reformed the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), for a new
seven years. Contrary to what the Greens have defended the European Parliament, the
reform confirms the trend described above: the aid will be granted very long time
unequally between farmers in different States and on the basis of historical references
benefit them wealthier. The "greening" - or good environmental practices - is
weakened against the ambitions that Europe was initially set. The industrial orientation and
Liberal agriculture is maintained, very large farms are protected at the expense of
medium and small structures. Agri-environnementales6 measures are not strengthened.
Several aid will be transferred to the European level of states and regions, which gives the
Wallonia great responsibility when it will transpose the regulations at regional level
European.
Under pressure from the World Trade Organization (WTO), the European Union is,

Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CAP LEVER TO PROMOTE
GREEN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND FAIR IN WALLONIA
Ecolo defends another use of public aid from the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
to reorient the development of Walloon agriculture to sustainable agriculture. In the
part of the transposition of the CAP 2015-2020 Wallonia, whose general direction remains very
neoliberal, Ecolo is based on the following principles:

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter AGRICULTURE AND FOOD - 4/27 p

a distribution of aid based on objective criteria and not on limiting
individual losses compared to aid affected passé13. A transitional period
must be provided to allow farmers to adapt;
aids that guide Walloon agriculture and encourage farmers to adopt
sustainable practices, in particular in view of the maintenance or restoration, of
Walloon agricultural production potential (preservation of water, soil,
biodiversity ...);
a concentration of aid to strategic sectors in difficulty, especially
Grassland cattle systems (slag as meat) in, or sheep, while maintaining a
balance between regions and sectors;
aids that allow the renewal of generations, both in the sustainability of
family farms by the arrival of players who are not from the world of agriculture;
of agricultural aid reserved for active farmers, agricultural commodities and suppliers
public goods (maintenance and protection of resources such as water, soil, etc.) 14;
aid which does not favor the big exploitations15 that take greater account
of product quality and employment and which are in the possible modulated
and capped by the number of work16 units.
Based on these principles, Ecolo made the following proposals for the application of the new CAP.

Proposal: To support farmers and their transition to a holding
durable
Today, the Walloon farmer who wants to support his family of his work is found in
deadlock. The conventional agricultural model evolves in a direction completely opposite to
sustainability :
economically: lower farm incomes, increased land prices and
raw material pressure in the retail and processing industry
price;
Socially: young disinterest in the art (many farms are not
successor), increased incidence of burnout and suicide among farmers,
Image rewarding little to the general public, lack of time to maintain
social relations … ;
Environmentally: the need to cultivate plots increasingly distant from the
farm, increasing cases of occupational diseases and cancers
... farmers;
Ecolo believes that the farmer has the right to live of his work, to convey his passion to his
children and to practice in optimal social and environmental conditions.
Ecolo therefore proposes, transversally:
to direct agricultural aid to medium-sized farms (see above);
to strengthen the autonomy of farms, for example through aid
differentiated;

13

Convergence at the Walloon level of fees to the base payment, DPU old.
For more information on the proposed Ecolo on this, see Chapter "Environment".
15
It would not be acceptable as direct payments even more digging profitability gap in favor of
the biggest or the most intensive types of farming operations.
16
The European Commission rejects the idea of ​​modulating the aid in function of the jobs created. At this stage, only the indemnity
compensatory disadvantaged regions reflects labor units and, to some extent, aid
Investments to.
14

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter AGRICULTURE AND FOOD - 5/27 p

maintain agricultural skills by promoting mixed and diversified farms;
recreate and strengthen independent advisory services to farmers;
to relax the standards for direct sale;
to set up a land bank for young people to access land;
facilitate company development and transmission of farms;
strengthen agricultural replacement services;
fiscally facilitate the use of seasonal labor.

Proposal: Make fairer conventional aids
Ecolo proposes to standardize the value of basic payment entitlements for 2020 and grant
an additional premium for the first hectare of each farm to support
more small and medium exploitations17.
Ecolo proposes using a maximally the possibilities for the granting of rights
new farmers (young and old), like the creation of a recovery mechanism
progressive without penalty tax or benefit of a "tandem plan" ensuring young people the
passing experience of elders.

Proposal: Making 'green payment "environmental opportunity
Part of the aid is subject to compliance with measures to promote the environment, it is the
"Green payment" or "greening". The equivalent measures that each Member State may
impose for greening should be simple and understandable, and their impact
environment should be at least equivalent to that of the three greening measures proposed
by the Commission (crop diversification, maintenance of permanent grassland and
preservation of ecological focus areas). In this context, crop diversification aims
mainly the floor, maintaining permanent grassland, the fight against change
climatic, and ecological focus areas, biodiversity. In Wallonia, they must
particular focus on the most important environmental challenges, including the fight against
soil erosion and ecological mesh.

Proposal: Condition coupled support to agricultural autonomy
The coupled aid, that is to say, the CAP aid for which payment is conditional on the achievement
of agricultural production, have virtually disappeared, except for suckler cows. However,
some coupled aid would increase the production of materials that are missing
cruelly, such as végétales18 proteins.
Ecolo offers:
create a new coupled aid for legumes crops or grassland
(increasing the clover) in a production development purposes and
increase the autonomy in plant proteins;

17

Ecolo also intends to take the greatest possible account of labor, which is not currently provided for in the CAP
2015-2020.
18
The lack of protein crop production in Europe and Wallonia obliges farmers to import huge
soybean quantities.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter AGRICULTURE AND FOOD - 6/27 p

replace the premium coupled suckler cow premium by herbe19, subject
compliance with a minimum and maximum load of cattle per hectare or maintain premium
suckler cow in the modulating to support grassland farms.

Proposal: Capping direct aid to ensure better
redistribution of aid
Ecolo proposes applying capping direct payments, and strict application of the ceilings for
Wallonia.
Indeed, for Ecolo, the granting of more than € 150,000 / year to farms sometimes representing
a unit of work, is not a fair and effective aid.
Therefore Ecolo proposes to gradually reduce the rate of aid from
€ 100,000 / year, and to cap at € 150,000 / year.

Proposal: To strengthen the bargaining power of farmers
Ecolo proposes to strengthen the bargaining power of farmers, as well as cooperation and
transparency within sectors, thanks to the exceptions to the Competition Law which
benefit, as part of the CAP 2015-2020, producer organizations (POs) and
interbranch organizations (OIP). This would for example to get better
balance of power between milk producers and intermediaries to obtain an adequate price.
Ecolo also like to encourage fruit and vegetable producers to organize into and OP
develop operational, environmental objectives assorted programs (obligation
EU) to benefit from EU financial support.

Proposal: Support and change the agri-environmental methods (MAE)
For Ecolo, it is essential that the Walloon farmers are supported to adhere to more
MAE, which should receive a larger budget. The aim is that only Ecolo
the least effective methods are being replaced by the more methods
performance and the MFA system is renewed, ambitious, credible and guaranteed
farmers.
It should support the MFA:
enabling a systems approach to operations: environmental action plan,
Low livestock in charge;
focused on grassland to promote biodiversity: native grassland, high prairie
biological value;
protecting the waters and struggling against erosion: grass strips, strip plots
appointed.
Finally, in the context of the fight against soil erosion, Ecolo proposes the establishment of shares
Agreed, for example across the watershed, and to make MFA.

Proposal: Promote agroecology
The investment aid for takeovers or closes extensions must be packed:
an environmental and energy audit of the entire operation;

19

The meadow is the cultivation method that potentially creates the most plant proteins.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter AGRICULTURE AND FOOD - 7/27 p

Prior to the implementation of the recommendations outlined in the audit;
an economic profitability plan based on reducing inputs (fertilizers,
Miscellaneous Amendments);
the establishment of a transition to result in organic farming practices or
agroecology;
a financial study with an independent body on the transmission of
capital (land, machines, houses, livestock etc.) between seller and buyer.

Proposal: Make a real opportunity for organic producers
Wallonia had only 221 processors in 2012 and some 1000 producers
organic. The cultivated area is about 7.6% of the total agricultural area, which, of
being up sharply, remains a market "niche".
Ecolo proposes to set a minimum target of 20% of cropland to organic in 2020.
To this end, Ecolo offers:
adopt development plans around specific products such as cereals,
potatoes and open field market gardening;
to grant specific support for sectors (beef and lamb, "organic" milk) forced
today sell their products at prices of conventional farming. It's about
also to resolve the crisis the price of milk;
to support agricultural products such differentiated quality products during the
conversion period to organic farming;
support the development of organic fish farming in Wallonia and Brussels;
implement and strengthen the strategic plan for the development of agriculture
Organic Wallonia.

Proposal: To compensate the losses of income Natura 2000
Natura 2000 is a European program that aims to maintain and restore the biological sites
interesting, to preserve biodiversity. The owners of the land concerned may
accuse a loss of income.
Ecolo supports the compensation for loss of income through allowances. He imports
However these benefits are duly justified and avoid sprinkling means
which would not apply to compensate real constraints or fail to achieve results
concrete for the maintenance or restoration of states of preservation.
In addition, farmers can become proactive local players to preserve this
Heritage training and valorisation of results achieved.

Proposal: Develop LEADER action
LEADER actions "Liaison Entre Actions de Development of the Rural Economy" or Group
Local Action (GAL), programs financed by the European Union, are the main
local and participatory bottom approach. They should be extended by involving more
local players since they allow appropriation of issues by the latter.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter AGRICULTURE AND FOOD - 8/27 p

PRIORITY 2: IMPROVING SYNERGIES AGRICULTURE AND TERRITORY
The rural territory is a historical, cultural and landscape, which is the habitat of
multiple species of fauna and flora, wild or domestic. As such, while "operator" of
this territory is subject to assignment rules, usage and good management. These rules evolve
depending on the value given to it in society. During the previous century, it is the value
Economic prevailed over all other functions performed by agriculture.
Agriculture has had a decisive impact on the rural territory, and thus are already subject to
many standards: Code rural, environmental regulations, town planning regulations. In this framework,
should create a fruitful synergy between rural stakeholders to protect but
also enhance the rural area in all its dimensions.

Proposal: Promoting access to land
A fair and secure access to land, such as food production factor is fundamental
and must be guided by public policy. For Ecolo, this resource is the earth must
be better shared and contribute to the maintenance of small and medium farms.
Ecolo proposes a revision of the lease law firm in order to promote access to operations
of land with the aim of ensuring access to the activity to the greatest number of farmers while
ensuring their long-term security.
To achieve this goal, Ecolo offers:
to generalize career lease that expires at the pensionable age (thus avoid
extensions newcomers expense);
open the legislation to other types of contracts of short durée20 but to frame this
possibility by limiting the time or on the surface;
to include environmental clauses in the lease include how to farm
ensure the maintenance of biological soil quality and fertility;
to develop a land bank inspired by the French system SAFER21 which
allow the regional power to stabilize land prices and allow access to
Earth to new operators;
publiques22 to allocate land for rent, taking into account criteria
environmental (with preferably organic) and creating / maintaining local employment.

Proposal: Empowering farmers for their management of common property
The "commons" include the landscape and social value of rural land, the
biodiversity and social cohesion. Farmers can help to maintain them.
To join the private interest that the public interest Ecolo proposed that the owner or rural
the operator of long term what the farmer plans his action in favor of sustainable management
and sustained its heritage, with a balance between incentives and constraints. The objective is to
out of the purely economic logic often chosen by a professional necessity for
converge to the common interest. The farmer can then be paid for the services rendered

20
Which introduces a certain flexibility to owners in a period of change and enables new
farmers to embark without engaging for too long periods.
21
The land development companies and www.safer.fr rural settlement have priority to purchase land and
Fair resale to farmers, for example, mainly those starting out.
22
Local authorities are also major landowners.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter AGRICULTURE AND FOOD - 9/27 p

natural and cultural heritage, to the extent that it contributes to the preservation of property
common.
The farmer plays an important social role in his village or his town, because of its
technical skills, its responsibility to land management, the hardware equipment
its disposal (machinery, buildings ...). It is often asked by the community, or formally
informally for maintenance or other services. It may also play a role
Hospitality, tourism, educational. Without prejudice to other professional sectors, this
contribution to community life is positive and should be encouraged by various incentives
(regional subsidies, municipal, farm income ...).

Proposal: Promoting Urban Agriculture
Food crops practices reappear in cities around the world.
They enable people to reconnect with their own food production, promote
sustainable food and thus to contribute to public health. Urban agriculture is
also an environmentally friendly practice: relocation of production, no use
pesticide, reducing transportation, greenhouse gases, etc. as well as social link:
the opportunity to meet, share, exchange advice or seeds. Finally, agriculture
Urban has a dual economic dimension: to produce its own food (vegetable
Urban) is advantageous and the development of local consumption (baskets deliveries
organic fruits and vegetables, etc.) contributes to the development of new economic activity in the city,
and thus to job creation.
Ecolo intends, through installation aids and incentive payments:
to vegetable producers and professional breeders direct link
urban consumers;
promote city initiatives production (vegetable gardens, small livestock, orchards,
production of eggs and honey ...), for family consumption or to a
local shops (point of sale, processing, Horeca);
develop areas of multifunctional output (food production, landscape,
living environment, biodiversity, permeability, etc.).
In town, especially in the Brussels Region, it is encouraging people to reconnect
with food production: in any small or larger scale, as part of farms
urban, be it vegetable individual, collective, professional or mixed culture that takes place
in the ground or in trays or on vertical structures.
To promote urban agriculture should also:
to overcome the problem of availability of surfaces, helping to provisioning
new areas (roofs, gardens ...)
limit the impact on crops of urban pollution and health risks;
to offer training to address the lack of promoters having
experience in this field;
to strengthen the profitability of agricultural projects and to grant public funding for
sustainable projects;
assist in the structuring of short courses to align supply and demand
and sell products;
define the environmental framework for giving the urban agriculture in touch
very close with the locals.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter AGRICULTURE AND FOOD - p 10/27

Proposal: Protecting basic resources such as soil and water
To protect natural resources, soil and water quality, Ecolo offers:
to introduce a principle of responsibility to ensure the maintenance of biological wealth
soil. One or more indicators, such as organic content or
length of the hedge for example, should be set up and appear on the sales acte23
land or rental agreement;
to declare the whole of Wallonia as "vulnerable zone" and to establish a new
plan for sustainable management of nitrogen (PGDA) to strengthen the fight against pollution
Soil and groundwater. If new constraints ensue for farmers,
necessary to ensure their information and advise them appropriately in the management of
manure and manure; but also to provide adequate control means;

gradually reduce the use of pesticides to reduce risks
health and the environment. In this sense, it is necessary above all to implement
new regulatory decisions following the transposition of the Directive and Regulation
European 2009;
to review, at European level, methods of Agréation pesticides to account
sublethal and chronic effects and cross effects of chemicals. he
as appropriate to ensure the independence of experts in this framework;
strengthen the federal plan to reduce the use of pesticides, especially for
agricultural pesticides, and widely recognized implement the ban pesticides
scientifically as decimating bee (neonicotinoids);
to advertise the Decree of the Walloon Parliament to come into force in June 2014,
establishing a framework for achieving a use of pesticides consistent with the
sustainability ;
delineate the very short term, in Wallonia, agricultural areas where pesticide use
is prohibited, as the edges of waterways, buffer strips near schools and
nurseries, and some very exposed subdivisions.

PRIORITY 3: LINKING AGRICULTURE AND FOOD AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL
ALL
Food crises caused by failures and abuses of the industrial food system have
raised new expectations around food, such as shortening of courses
production-consumption, maintaining local agriculture, quality food
differentiated, and tasteful.
Recent years have seen the development of purchasing groups, short circuits,
Agriculture and mini bio, agro-ecology, purchasing local and organic products
by community canteens, the interest of chefs to these products, etc.
All of these initiatives reflect the research, by part of the population and the world
agriculture, quality products whose provenance is known. This induces a change in our
eating habits and food production.
The success of these companies also reflects the economic and social feasibility of
transition to an agriculture that respects the environment, consumers and
producers.

23

In the same way that energy efficiency will figure to a building.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter AGRICULTURE AND FOOD - p 11/27

To support the transition to such a model and uses the key to reconnect producer
and consumers to develop mutual trust generates quality products,
give pride to farmers while empowering them about their vis-à-vis roles
society, Ecolo proposes to develop a package of measures as part of an Alliance EmploiEnvironnement directed to agriculture and food.

Proposal: Create Employment-Environment Alliance "Agriculture and
Food "
The Employment-Environment Alliance is a unifying tool, mobilizing and participatory.
This tool should mobilize and coordinate all public, private and community around
concerted actions affecting production (agriculture, horticulture and fisheries); There
processing / conservation; distribution and consumption.
The objective of this new alliance is to promote short circuits resolutely register
Employment in the environmental alliances in place in Wallonia and Brussels (including
Transition towards sustainable food program).
It involves a genuine pact between the two regions in particular to promote access to the market
Brussels for producers / processors of Wallonia, and between the different actors
concerned to develop economic sectors related to the environment and the creation
quality jobs.
The entire chain is involved: production (including urban agriculture); the
packaging ; the transformation ; logistics and distribution (Horeca, collective canteens).
The players will be offered a genuine individual and collective commitment to work together
for the achievement of shared goals.
The employment potential in creating short circuits in Wallonia and Brussels is therefore
important. If it is not yet fully estimated, and already we can already identify areas
activity in which a labor (skilled and unskilled) will be required:
Agriculture: in this primary sector, these include stem the disappearance
of existing operations through diversification and ensuring the resumption of operations in
offering alternatives oriented production to local consumption;
horticulture / gardening: unskilled labor and seasonal, especially for
Harvest / gathering activities;
transformation (the food trade);
distance marketing and direct sales;
the technical and commercial management and logistics;
catering;
the new training and of education;
etc.
For each sector and for each phase, there should be provision of information,
awareness, regulation, economic stimulus, integration and research and
training.
The implementation of the Employment-Environment Alliance "Agriculture and Food" must
especially :
structuring the offer production / processing quality in courts24 circuits: Security
supply taking into account the seasonality of production, increasing
24

There are two models of short circuits:

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter AGRICULTURE AND FOOD - p 12/27

global production volumes to meet demand, food security,
freshness, production modes to suit a qualitative objective (development of
official signs of quality, organic, of differentiated quality), production that meets the
food needs of local populations (market gardening, fruit growing, ...);
help to increase demand and allow the regularity: a proper demand
a necessary condition for sustaining a short circuit structure;
structuring synergies to meet supply and demand.

Proposal: Adopt a pact "farmers-distributors-consumers"
Food companies, retailers and traders may be forced to
provide for local products or offer to sell a certain proportion of local products or
differentiated quality. By cons, networking from consumer demand
can be a base for action.
Governments could well be the promoters of a pact between the volontaire25
farmers, the distribution sector and consumers, which aims to present to the
sale of local products and quality, at a remunerative price for farmers. This
would notably provide to milk producers a profitable price in
extension of existing initiatives such "Fairbel" and "Band of fe-milk". The role of
government is to stimulate the actors, to provide verifiable figures and methods
robust, inform consumers about the products and offered for sale.
The presence of government must serve as guarantor of the quality of processes as well as
products subject to the sale.

Proposal: To encourage citizens to turn to products
local
The citizen must have the opportunity to be an actor of his food choices. Although chains of
develop marketing everywhere, fresh food from short circuits,
season, are still too inaccessible. The mode of transport used to carry these products
Belgium is, meanwhile, rarely shown.
Ecolo offers:
create a price differential in favor of ecological and quality products from the
short circuits through incentive tools to causing gradual changes;
to develop a labeling in economic matters (price per unit or weight)
Environmental (CO² seasons and production methods (greenhouse, outdoor ...), transport
(airplane, boat, short circuit) 26, health (composition)). The source must also be
informed and more detailed relevant information can be made available
in stores or online.

- That concerning the commodities that the consumer can directly incorporate into his food such as vegetables and
farm products (cheese, meat or prepared products) for which you want to promote more direct sales
the producer closer to the consumer. Relational proximity induced a short circuit enhances transparency
the die values ​​the expertise of producers, improve the quality of products and services and creates links
Confidence between producers and consumers in particular on the quality. Given the reduced number of intermediaries, the
margin that keeps the farmer is better;
- Shorter circuits of conventional agriculture where farmers functions / wholesalers / processors /
artisans are preserved, but the concept guarantees that the product of the craftsman consists mainly of Walloon products
which must be of high quality and must ensure fair compensation to the farmer.
25
Inspired by the example of the agreement between farmers and distributors which helped to reach an agreement on the price of the
beef the benefit of all.
26
The implementation of this measure will be based on experiences in other European countries.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter AGRICULTURE AND FOOD - p 13/27

Moreover, on the ground, there are many initiatives that emerge in short circuits
(groupings of common purchases, deposits, purchases at the farm ...). In order to increase the consumption
via producer groups / consumers, Ecolo offers:
accompaniment to the creation and sustainability of the groups;
the implementation of specific support based on the type of group;
networking groups;
support to municipalities to equip premises to accommodate groups (good
reception conditions, compliance with health conditions ...);
the authorization of the voluntary participation of jobseekers to groups.

Proposal: Promote local production flow in circuits
proximity
Local initiatives
Shared or individual gardens, farm sales, farmers markets, the
joint procurement groups (GAC), groups of solidarity purchasing (GAS) are all
initiatives to support especially through municipalities, ADL27, of Contracts
River of GAL28 ... The Regions must encourage and support these local initiatives, for example,
by calls for projects.
Furthermore, to best reconcile the objective of development of short circuits, competence
Regional, with the obligation to meet the food chain security constraints,
federal, Ecolo proposes that the regions are at the initiative of a draft agreement
cooperation between regions and the federal government. The Walloon and Brussels Regions will drive for
bring this to the interregional and federal agenda. The cooperation agreement will aim
primarily policies related to the food chain safety.
Horeca
Like the Brussels initiative "Tasting Brussels" Ecolo offers support for that Horeca
includes in its range, flat 100% quality local, fresh and seasonal. Initiatives
for example can be taken as part of the "Taste Week" in Brussels or
"Organic Week" in Wallonia and Brussels. They may also be amplified in
clearly defined procedures for example by calls for projects or partnerships (eg
with federations of Horeca, the UCM ...).
The events
More and more arts and cultural events seek to reduce their environmental footprint
and promote local quality food. They must be supported and actors
all events, especially if they are subsidized, should be encouraged to follow this movement.

Proposal: Promote sustainable food in communities
Public authorities (schools, governments ...) and private (corporate restaurants ...)
are an excellent lever to favor a sustainable and balanced diet and
aim to gradually introduce eco-consumer behavior.
Ecolo proposes that public contracts are directed by precise specifications in
on sustainable food. Technical support should enable communities to join

27
28

Local development agencies
Local Purchase Group

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter AGRICULTURE AND FOOD - p 14/27

local supply contracts based on a specification "sustainable agriculture and
balanced and quality food. "
Ecolo also proposes the creation of a facilitator function - feeding counselor
sustainable - providing services, information and advice to communities. To assist the
food industry to move towards a sustainable diet, it is necessary to develop a
methodology of action equivalent to that which has proven policy
energy.
It is also essential to provide support programs and training
professionals in the community kitchen, transition assistance, practical tools, such as those
funded Brussels-Capital Region.
Finally, to put meat consumption to its rightful place and respect the personal choices
Consumer Ecolo proposes that the public authorities have restaurants
always a vegetarian dish as an alternative, increase the servings of vegetables and
provide fruit throughout the menus, in order to improve the nutritional balance and
Dietary plate. An encouragement to do the same in the private sector will be proposed.

Proposal: Strengthen the actors and knowledge of short circuits
In the context and the place of agriculture and agri-food industry, initiatives
short circuits (cooperatives, producer groups, corporations, community initiatives to "
is "...) should receive structured support through the AEAA to:
ensure greater stability of technical and economic operating conditions
companies and short circuit initiatives;
strengthen their positioning and attractiveness in the food environment
dominant.
Under the Marshall Plan 2.Vert, Wallonia has created and supported a Reference Center
Short circuits, housed within the Economic Stimulation Agency (ESA), with four
partenaires29: UCM, SAW-B and IEW DiversiFerm that are, for each of the structures,
referents "short circuits". The Reference Centre works in synergy with the single desk
"Diversification and processing of agricultural products".
Ecolo wish that this structure is perpetuated and that short circuits will be subject to a
real strategic challenge for economic development.
Moreover, for Ecolo, local development structures (GAL ADL PCDR, Natural Park ...)
must incorporate in their field action, support initiatives to short circuits and
local products.
Given the health standards imposed by the FPS public health and control of the FASFC
- Which must be suitable for craft production - Cell Quality Farm products
(CQPF), which plays a fundamental role in enabling producers and artisans-processors,
to produce and market, should be strengthened.
The modules of training and education in agriculture and food technology schools should also consider the development potential short circuits.

29
Union of Middle Classes; Social economy Federation SAW-B; Inter-Environnement Wallonie and has DiversiFerm
mission to support Walloon transformers producers in their diversification process.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter AGRICULTURE AND FOOD - p 15/27

Proposal: Create economic tools for the development of circuits
local distribution
Taking into account the signals clearly displayed and proactively by the government,
Ecolo proposes to activate the financial tools, development tools and hosting
business and operating support sustainable agribusinesses.
Financial tools
Ecolo proposes easier access to investment credit, including micro-credit. This
measure previously requested information and sensitization of public bodies and
private financing (banks, as Credal actors, regional and sub-regional Invests ...)
the challenges of short circuits and their specificities.
The investment aid systems for the agricultural sector (ISA) should also be
oriented with the aim of increasing the quality of agricultural production for food
local and regional.
Ecolo also proposes to introduce pre-activity grants to encourage the creation of TPE
and SMEs in the field of sustainable food, to allow project leaders
to make preliminary tests at the launch of commercial activity (eg testing
production / processing, pilot equipment, pre-tests geared toward organoleptiques30
consumers to define the product to be marketed ....) and nurseries (local
equipped to test an activity before developing).
Development, hosting and business support
Ecolo proposes that, in rural areas, spaces are reserved for mini-zonings in
sustainable food vocation. At the level of urban areas, proposes to study the Ecolo
ability to create halls with fresh local produce.
Economic development intercommunal need to be aware of potential
development of short circuits, namely the development of mini-zonings to vocation
sustainable food; the spatial planning tools to facilitate the introduction of
these mini-zonings.
Ecolo proposes that local authorities, but also the Local Action Groups (LAGs), Parks
natural, etc. may create logistic workshops or agricultural halls relay and food
for producers and craftsmen transformers to strengthen organizations
producers / artisans-processors to reduce production costs and enhance the
products.
Ecolo also proposes that:
regional authorities provide financial and technical assistance for the implementation
compliance and modernization tools for processing / storage standards
hygiene, environmental rules via existing structures (financial tools,
Invests, of investment aid programs, Cell Quality Products farmers ...)
the local slaughterhouses and their related activities (cutting, processing)
are maintained and supported. They are an important issue for the development of
short courses and for maintaining the activity of some cow-feeders;
support is also given to the implementation of business strategies on plans
accounting and finance, the commercial marketing, and adapting infrastructure
(hygiene standards, technical and technological improvements ...)
support is granted for the development of cooperatives of producers / processors
and / or distributors.
30

All that is likely to excite a sensory receptor (appearance, smell, taste, texture, consistency ...).

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter AGRICULTURE AND FOOD - p 16/27

Proposal: Promoting local production of quality and gastronomy
The promotion to be effective, should cover various aspects of production and products
Bookmark with:
the origin of
producers ...)

products (identification of

producers

or groups of

the mode of production;
Environmental gains (mode of transport, short-distance transport,
reducing packaging ...) and public health (no residues, additives ...).
Ecolo offers a certification of local products and sustainable labeling identifying them.
To ensure consumer promotion, communities, the Horeca sector ...
Internet platform bringing together all the information about these sustainable local products
must be established. The promotion must also be ensured in public places (stations,
tourist showcases ...) and different events (festivals ...).
In addition, the culinary heritage and food expertise are social bond vectors
and intercultural encounters there are also many food traditions. They
are an important part of the intangible heritage and biodiversity
agricultural. Ecolo also sees fit to defend, or even upgrade to regenerate heritage
gourmet. To this end, Ecolo proposes developing a Taste Institute, which will be based on
existing dynamics such as Slow Food movement and would vocation:
develop an education and awareness program to taste to the attention of
public and especially children;
to conduct comparative studies of products on the market in terms of health and
environmental impact;
identify and promote the traditional recipes and know-how and products
with a real added value in the context of sustainable consumption;
to become a training institute for professionals and future professionals
the catering trade but also amateurs;
to contribute to preserving and improving the organoleptic quality of products
sustainable food.

PRIORITY 4: PROMOTE GOOD HEALTH FOOD AND
THE PLANET

Proposal: To have a coordinated policy Food
Nutritional balance of our plates is far from optimal: too many trans fats (with
an imbalance omega 3 and omega 6), too much salt and added sugars, too much meat, not enough
fresh fruits and vegetables and season, not always very healthy additives and preservatives.
Given the epidemic of overweight and obesity, and their attendant related diseases, it is essential to
define a public health policy directed towards the nutritional quality.
If the National Health and Nutrition Plan is now out at regional, measures for
regulations on fat, additions salts and sugars should be taken at the federal level
to the extent that voluntary agreements with food companies do not get
the expected results.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter AGRICULTURE AND FOOD - p 17/27

For Ecolo, it should coordinate all the health promotion by politiques31
food, conducted at different levels of power. This is to ensure the effectiveness of
Interventions for preventing obesity and overweight in the field and to strengthen
the work of all health actors (general practitioners, local promotion of Centre

Promotion of sport (ADEPS ...). The overall coordination must be put in
work as closely as possible the needs of the population.
Ecolo offers:
priority and specific support to the populations affected by the weakened slightly
traditional campaigns on healthy eating and quality; it is essential
to support and train the actors for the purpose of welfare and health in the
partenariats32 framework;
promoting good dietary practices within the school and with associations
parents, working with actors santé33;
a policy against overeating and obesity.
In addition, commercial advertising encourages us to behaviors often contrary to the objective
a sustainable food consumption. This is why Eco offers a range of
regulatory measures commerciale34 advertising. In terms of food, Ecolo
calls particularly for the ban:

advertising aimed at children under twelve years;
dissemination of uncontrolled by independent professional health messages
businesses and competent in child nutrition or recommendations
Nutritional made by companies related to the interests of the food industry
(example: this chocolate bar = a glass of milk);
the entrance into the school teaching material proposed by the food industry;
advertising for products in relation to which public authorities are conducting a
limiting consumption countryside in a public health concern
(pesticides ...).
Moreover, Ecolo wants to regulate the information on the packaging and remove the misleading information
(eg regarding the presence of fruit or flavorings, or by statements like
"Artisanal" ...).

Proposal: Reduce the environmental impact of food consumption
Ecolo wants to reduce the ecological footprint linked to food consumption. Belgium, as
EU massively important vegetable proteins for food for her
animals (primarily for intensive pig and chicken), this at the cost of heavy
ecological and social impact in the country. Furthermore, from the point of view of health,
Global meat consumption in our country remains excessive. Ecolo proposes to continue
encouraging awareness campaigns to reduce meat consumption.

Proposal: To fight against food waste
The fight against food waste in households, in the catering industry, in communities,
in the food industry and the distribution must become a priority.
In our regions, household food waste is around 20kg / person / year. On the scale
Belgium, this represents an average of 174 euros per year per household and scale
World is a quarter of the food produced is thrown without being consumed. For Ecolo, the
fight against food waste goes through different measures:
better consumer information, particularly in relation to labeling,
conservation and expiration dates;
AFSCA relaxation of standards appropriate to the communities to be able to condition
bulk rather than mini-portions, while respecting the principle of risk control;
the development of a framework promoting the gift of agribusiness firms to food banks and other charities that help
for the poorest populations;
the integration of inventory management plans and measures against waste in
enabled distribution business environment.

Proposal: Strengthen the controls on the presence of contaminants
in Foods
Animal food is also a human health issue, as well as care
veterinarians provided to them.
Animal meal
Ecolo opposes the incorporation of animal meal in feed for fish, poultry and
pigs, for reasons of nutritional balance (balance between Omega 3 and 6) and because it is very
difficult to ensure the traceability of these flours and prevent cannibalism (the origin of the crisis
Mad Cow).
Antibiotics
Consumption of antibiotics in farming is also a potential health
public, insofar as it may create in animals and humans resistance
antibiotics and wide bacteriological contamination (see the beginning of the crisis ESBL enzyme
present in raw and likely to become resistant to antibiotics meats). Ecolo
demand a stricter ban on antibiotics in farms and ways of
strict control of veterinary requirements.
Pesticides
According to an official report of the European Commission, nearly half of fruit, vegetables and
cereals currently sold in the EU are contaminated by pesticides. Belgium
is no exception to this development all the more worrying that five of the most common pesticides
detected are classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or disrupting the hormonal system.
The controls of the FASFC regarding the presence of contaminants (especially pesticides and
antibiotics) should be amplified so as to better protect the consumer to identify the
responsibilities and, if necessary, to impose the sanctions requises35.

35

See on this subject our proposals in Chapter "Environment".

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter AGRICULTURE AND FOOD - p 19/27

Proposal: Clarify the role and action of the AFSCA
The AFSCA is an indispensable institution in public health that should also remain
under the tutelage of the Minister (and not that of the Minister of independent and agriculture).
Nevertheless, procedures and requirements are more suitable for medium and large
businesses and cause many problems for small producers and artisans. For Ecolo,
procedures should be relaxed for them, while maintaining a performance requirement.
Furthermore, it should recognize the importance of food traceability system in
place, even if it has failures due to the complexity of processing circuits
and distribution. In this regard, checks sometimes neglect certain risks from practices
industrial as the presence of residues of antibiotics or pesticides in food.
For Ecolo, the FASFC must evolve into a genuine federal agency quality
nutrition and dietetics, and not only the health quality and traceability. It is therefore
this Agency which will ensure compliance of the measures proposed above and make the
Nature of recommendations to improve the nutritional quality, alongside protection against
food risks.

PRIORITY 5: MAKE WORLD AGRICULTURE nourishing, PROFITABLE,
INCLUSIVE AND ECOLOGICAL
The right to food is an international human right that protects the right of every human being
feed themselves in dignity, whether by producing his own food or buying it. This
is not entitled to a minimum of calories, proteins and other specific nutrients or Right
to be fed. This is the guarantee of a right to food which not only requires that the
Food is available, but it is accessible and appropriate.
So says the UN rapporteur on the Right to Food.
Ecolo wants to strengthen the effectiveness of this right in the world and especially in our relations
with the countries affected under-nutrition and malnutrition.
In Belgium, we can not consider that the right to food is guaranteed for all today and
especially the right to a healthy and not only adequate food. Food aid meets a
demand increasingly important and should find the necessary means to respond as
that any citizen can access them sufficient income.
To mark the importance of this right, Ecolo supports the establishment of a framework law making that right
more explicit and effective, also ensuring the right of consumers to safe food and
safe and organizing a coordination of national and regional policies for food.
The right to food, and its corollary, the right to food security, are rights
Fundamental enjoys special recognition in international36 law. Thus, the
international institutions, including in particular the WTO, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
World Bank, have the responsibility to create conditions for implementation of this right.
Ecolo believes that in the context of the necessary overhaul of agricultural policies,
regulation of agricultural and food markets radically different from current practices
strengthening of free trade is nécessaire37. Agriculture must be considered by the WTO
as a specific sector, enjoying exception clauses in sovereign purpose
food. Ecolo is the implementation of an agricultural exception.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter AGRICULTURE AND FOOD - p 20/27

This is a new global framework for agriculture and food which our planet needs.
This framework should be based on food sovereignty concept defined as "the ability
countries or groups of countries to establish the most appropriate agricultural policies
without their people that they can have a negative impact on the populations of other countries.
Complementary to the concept of food security, food sovereignty gives
particular importance to social and environmental conditions of food production
as well as its cultural roots. It advocates a more equitable access to land for farmers
poor, if necessary by means of land reform and the rights of security mechanisms
land use. "38

Proposal: To regulate the international trade in raw materials
It should better supervise intercontinental transport of foodstuffs. Thus, States
or communities of states should be able to introduce social tariffs and
environmental, as proposed Ecolo across Europe in order to promote their autonomy
food and less dependence on international trade. Imported products must
observe the same social, environmental standards (GMO, no hormones
growth but also avoid some unacceptable production process as disinfection
chlorine ...) and animal welfare that European products. Ecolo intends to include
respect for social and environmental clauses in the context of investment agreements and
business partnerships and establish monitoring mechanisms to ensure compliance.
Ecolo otherwise refuses in agriculture and food, free trade - particularly
through the EU-US Treaty being negotiated, comes before the health of Europeans and lead
the introduction in the European market of products such as hormone beef, chicken
acid washed or transgenic maize, for example.

Proposal: Ensuring access to land for farmers
Large firms, and even some states to buy good land prices in central Europe and
East and in countries in développement39. Farmers are therefore deprived of their
working tool, which undermines their own subsistence capacity and food security
these countries. Many rural southern countries were forced to migrate to cities or
beyond, in search of a job.
Ecolo will defend a strengthened especially in land that protects food crops and do
not allow misappropriation of land at the expense of the latter. Investments in
land purchases must be transparent and regulated to avoid new concentrations
land tenure and land markets.

Proposal: Ending speculation on food
It should develop a common European policy to fight against various
forms of speculation on food products. Stringent regulatory measures against
speculation food must be in place. Priority should be given to
the cultivation of cereals and vegetable protein to feed people before feeding cattle
or manufacture of fuels.

Proposal: Improve farmers' participation in management measures
local
For Ecolo, to contribute to the quality of life in rural areas, should be protected and
revalue farming knowledge. This notably through training, financial support
Local farmers and their involvement in the definition of policies and means to rurality.
Women play a critical role in agriculture in both North and South, where they are
However, victims of discrimination. As part of the revitalization of peasant agriculture,
therefore appropriate to ensure the empowerment of women, including through the establishment of
farmers' networks to ensure their participation in the social, economic and cultural
to allow the deployment of the solidarity of women.

Proposal: Reforming the CAP in order to gradually incorporate the principles of
agroecology
At European level, Ecolo promotes the following principles:
the economic viability of extensive farms and short circuits, income
decent, quality jobs, through market regulation and price transparency;
the maintenance and strengthening of both biological and social diversity;
the territorial link between production and consumption;
the balance between food production, energy and environmental protection;
Equality between women and men;
support research and training;
animal welfare;
the rule of agro-ecological practices, notably by concentrating the planned aid
the Common Agricultural Policy on pioneering a practical perspective
environmental and job creating;
the protein and energy self-sufficiency; given the scarcity of fossil resources,
oil-free agriculture should be considered;
the production of goods other than food, especially raw materials
Renewable which will power the whole economy, without prejudice to the
security and food sovereignty.
Ultimately, agriculture must:
able to do without fossil fuels, for example by growing pérennes40 cereals;
be based on an organic fertilizer which itself relies on closed cycles
organic material ;
see the whole chain of storage and marketing simplify and shorten;
become independent vis-à-vis the food industry and its various sectors that,
through financing in areas such as research, health education or
advertising, influence policy in this area.

Cereals perennial (perennial): cereals can grow several times in their lives. The advantages of the plants
on perennial annuals are many. See http://www.etopia.be/spip.php?article1752

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter AGRICULTURE AND FOOD - p 22/27

PRIORITY 6: CHOOSING SAFE AND AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY TO GIVE
CROSS-CUTTING TOOLS FOR TRANSITION AND INNOVATION
For agriculture of the 21st century calls for Ecolo technological choices:
preserving and restoring biodiversity, soil and subsoil resources;
using the potential of life with understanding and respect for mechanisms
life ;
reducing dependence on fossil fuels and non-renewable;
appropriated by all including small producers;
corresponding to a high level of employment.
The agro-ecological model best fits all of these criteria.

Proposal: Reject GMOs model
From the first GMO crop authorizations in Europe, Ecolo has defended the strict application
the precautionary approach to environmental risks and biodiversity posed by
uncontrolled spread of these organisms. The consumer has, moreover, always
mainly manifested its opposition to GMOs. The release into the environment should
imperatively be avoided, the precautionary principle respected and the free choice of
consumers and producers guaranteed non-GMO.
Ecolo therefore proposes:
making at European level, more transparent decision, scientific and objective. The
current framework of risk analysis is widely insuffisant41 and independence and scope
competence of experts for assessment should be improved and expanded. Beyond the health and environmental aspects, the assessment procedure must provide
a diverse range of expertise, including taking into account the socioeconomic and ethical factors related to GMOs. The procedure for the Commission to
take the GMO authorization decisions in the absence of a qualified majority
Cabinet must be abandoned. The recommendations of citizens juries
should be more listened;
to introduce, at the Belgian level, an analysis of whether socio-economic and societal
GMOs, and before any trial authorization in fields or marketing of GMOs.
We must improve the independence and functioning of the Biosafety Advisory Council;
to establish at European level the labeling of products from animals fed with GMOs;
at European level to defend the principle of zero tolerance with regard to the
seeds contaminated by GMOs. This is particularly prégnant for the sector
organic farming;
at European level to encourage independent research on issues of impact
of GMOs on the environment and health;
to adopt the principle of strict liability of producers / carriers GMO
in case of contamination of agricultural production and beekeeping or for damage
environmental and impose security funds and funding mechanisms
precautions to charge them to steer public research based on a
prior assessment of agronomic interest of a particular variety of plant (GMO

non GMO) using criteria of sustainable development and in the extension of
principle of food sovereignty. A study on the costs of development and implementation
on the market of GMOs supported by the government must be made to scale
European;
to Belgium and its territories GMO-free Regions. The Civic Resistance and
collective to GM crops can not be regarded as an association of
malefactors.

Proposal: Frame agricultural energy production
Approximately 5% of diesel sold in Belgium is the biodiesel and 7% of gasoline sold
the agroéthanol. The use of biofuels first génération42 in the transport sector
has been further stimulated by federal loi43. This is not a way forward, given the importance of
necessary surfaces in Belgium, Europe and the South, the balance unfavorable CO2 (the
CO2 emissions from most of these biofuels are higher than those of their
fossil equivalents) and indirect impacts on the environment and social rights in countries
from South. For Ecolo, inclusion obligations biofuels in fuels and
fiscal support measures should be removed. Public support should be focused on
sectors that offer real added value societal, which is not the case of biofuels.
Despite the impetus of the Commission, the European Council has decided to review its objectives and
be limited to maximum 5% the use of first generation biofuels under
the European target of 10% renewable energy in transport. Ecolo proposes to limit
5% maximum use of first generation biofuels, to reach a goal
2.5% for "advanced biofuels" made from agricultural and forestry waste or
Microalgae - called 2nd and 3rd generations. The balance for the target of 10% energy
renewables in transport by 2020 from electric vehicles.
In addition, it is useful to continue the search for biofuels 2nd and 3rd génération44,
one can legitimately ask about the interest to burn biomass to valuable
advancing vehicles. It would be better to increase the effectiveness of these and, especially,
control demand in transport.
By the biomass against a usable potential. The development of biomethane is
support. The biogas contributes to the energy independence of farms but can
also play a significant role in the production of renewable electricity and heat
recoverable outside of farms. Its development still requires a framework
to avoid regulatory risks of pollution and uncontrolled slide into
agriculture for energy purposes.

Proposal: Reorienting education, training and research
Education and training
Whether in qualifying secondary education or higher education courses,
Ecolo wants learning agroecological methods and organic farming
integrates educational content to heart: it is a prerequisite to strengthening
the competence of agricultural professionals. In addition, it should also be wear
special effort to lifelong learning.

1st-generation biofuels are plants of which the edible part is used to make a fuel,
rest of the plant is eliminated.
43
Act of June 20, 2013 to increase the levels of mandatory incorporation of biofuels into fuels:
diesel must contain a minimum of 6% biodiesel, and the minimum gasoline 4 or 9% bioethanol (E5 or E10 gasoline).
44
2nd generation fuel use all of the plant and those of the third generation are made of other plants
and other production methods.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter AGRICULTURE AND FOOD - p 24/27

The organic sector has created the collective "formation organic" to sensitize the world of training
the need to provide training both in higher education and in teaching
vocational and continuing training. Schools are beginning to position themselves in this niche,
in addition to continued training organizations.
Ecolo offers:
awareness training players écoles45 high and secondary schools and offer
Specific technical and economic training and organic farming in modules
the so-called conventional formations;
finance the start of training in organic agriculture as in schools
that upper secondary;
provide for the dissemination of information to target audiences.
Search
In terms of research, as cross transition tool, Ecolo offers
redefine innovation and going beyond its purely technical dimension. Innovation is
have the audacity to do otherwise, to push the limits of conventional agriculture to
better. Closely linked to training and research proposals, ecological design
innovation aims to emerge from decades of industrialization and genetic engineering as the only
new technological possibility.
Ecolo supports a rapid concentration of efforts and budgets that allow
farmers adapt their production methods in the best possible conditions. In this
sense Ecolo offers:
a study program on the consequences and the necessary adaptations sector
Walloon agriculture to climate change;
support the development of research on renewable energies
agriculture ;
conditionality for sustainability criteria in the granting of public support for a project
agricultural research;
an application of research policy in organic agriculture as defined in
Bio plan with the means relating thereto; innovation through public investment
both in research itself and in coordinating the recherche46;
increased contribution of research to the development and upgrading
old native varieties, and conservation of genetic régional47;
a curriculum for specific problems: waste recovery,
research to achieve the protein autonomy or development of new
food;
a reconciliation between agricultural research and other research areas
to define synergies and benefit from multidisciplinary approaches.
For efficiency and consistency, agricultural research will be better articulated with
regional research strategy. A convergence of methods of evaluation both at ex
ante and ex post between different lines of research (agriculture, energy, etc.) will help
greater visibility for the various research actors in a logic
Learning crossover between themes. The introduction of sustainability criteria in
these valuation levels is a priority.

Environmental Justice
TERRITORY DEVELOPMENT
A land management for more equity
spatial, economic and social
Status and political horizon
State of play
Spatial planning covers all actions by public bodies or
private in a given area and that shape its landscape. This policy allows distribution
balanced and forward-looking activities, equipment and means of communication in
taking into account the natural dimensions, human, economic and even strategic.
In Belgium, as in all European countries, the land use model
mainly affected by the urbain1 sprawl. This development was mainly due to the
development of individual automobile with its democratization and improving links
transport. In Wallonia, in the last 20 years, 30,000 hectares of farmland were
urbanized including the benefit of road infrastructure. In the Brussels Region that is characterized
by implantation of households on the outskirts of urban and rural nuclei, causing
relocation of economic and commercial activities, which in turn consume
new spaces and require new road infrastructure.
Reforms by environmentalists in recent years have laid the foundations for true
ecological transition for the benefit of citizens and businesses. They allowed the establishment
outils2 of modernized and consistent determinant of the goals of mobility, economy,
housing, environment and renewable energy for Wallonia. In Brussels,
amplified by the adoption of the reform of contracts sustainable neighborhoods, program
urbaine3 renovation contribute significantly to improving the living conditions in
deprived areas and generally improve the image of the city.

The territorial equity as political horizon
For Ecolo, the spatial planning policy must ensure everyone conditions
equitable access to a quality living environment, a healthy environment, public services,
employment and various benefits of life in society. To do this, space is scarce and in front
therefore be used in the most efficient manner possible, regional planning must integrate
nature and its resources and save. The territory must be managed because it is sparingly
a "resource" rare and non-renewable.
This management involves the consideration of rural space as a development issue. He ... not
can be reduced to the rank of land reserve or recreation area. Agricultural production

and forestry there are essential. In rural areas, people should enjoy sufficient
local services that meet their needs (employment, mobility, public services, schools ...). In
this sense, it is important to address energy issues, mobility and development
local quality and non-relocatable jobs. These challenges are all the more important as
number of rural communities today are struggling to fulfill their missions, lack of resources
sufficient financial and human.
For Ecolo, rural development is closely related, and should be linked with that of
cities. The city that relocates its production activities within it has the great advantage of saving
natural resources and minimize waste, reduce the need for travel,
foster an endogenous economic development and generate local jobs. The city
sustainability is not only a city that participates in the fight against global warming
climate by imposing buildings with high energy performance standards. This is
and above all, physical and political space within which new economic reports
social and must be able to deploy, with the horizon of solidarity, both spatial and
time, necessary to protect our common environment. What is true for
City also applies to large and small rural centers.
Ecolo therefore advocates a coherent management of land use to help reduce the
spatial, economic and social inequalities, optimize costs and public infrastructure
to reduce CO2 emissions from travel, mainly road.
To do this, land has to be seen across the board in connection
with sectoral policies such as housing, mobility, energy, the environment ... The
Land use policy must contribute to the construction of concrete answers to
population growth, climate challenge to energy saving and energy needs
renewable, to the development of sustainable mobility, social cohesion and
economic development.

The Ecolo force lines in the field of spatial planning
The challenge is daunting. Reforms launched in Brussels and Wallonia lay the foundation to achieve
the objectives listed above. To continue the movement launched in recent years,
Ecolo door the following priorities:
Build a favorable quality of living for social cohesion
Ensuring everyone a well located and develop sustainable housing accommodation
Stimulate economic activity related to the territory's resources
Making a participatory land policy
Establish performance tools guarantee an efficient territorial development

Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: BUILDING A LIFE UNDER FAVORABLE TO THE QUALITY
SOCIAL COHESION
For Ecolo, territorial organization should create conditions for the coexistence of living
Overall, the meeting between people. It should also contribute to a quality living environment and
meeting the needs of inhabitants and residents.
At the regional level, the quality of the living environment is defined among others by easy access to
services, the possibility of using public transit and active modes (walking and cycling)
a balanced distribution of public spaces including green areas, etc.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter PLANNING - p 2/23

At the neighborhood level, the quality of life presupposes a particular oriented renovation policy
to strengthen existing neighborhoods and their ability to adapt to change
(résilience4).
At the building level, this requires a conscious architectural heritage to value and
preserve ; creative architecture, integrated and respectful prescribed to meet the challenge
energy and social, to ensure the opening of the neighborhood, to contribute to the living environment
quality, to ensure accessibility and comfort of residents.

Proposal: Organize the territory for sustainable mobility
In Wallonia and Brussels, the transition to sustainable mobility will be one of the issues
important in the coming decades. A better distribution of services, employment and recreation
help to reduce travel requirements. This implies a more compact organization and
refocused the territory from urban and central areas ruraux5.
Mobility and accessibility are basic rights for a full and quality life, attention
particular should be given to persons with reduced mobility (PRM) under all
both public and private projects.
Specifically, Ecolo offers:
Encourage active and sustainable modes of transport: pedestrians, bicycles, taxis, cars
shared, public transport; approach that also meets the needs of
Senior Citizens, Women and Youth, whose movements are
mainly according to these modes of transport;
Develop sustainable transport modes to meet the travel needs
(rail, for example) rather than investing in new heavy infrastructure
dedicated to the automobile (bypasses, enlargements, tunnels, viaducts, ramps
motorway, etc.);
Ensuring more security and usability by (re-) arrangements that redistribute more
public space equitably among all users. ;
Develop, with the exception of transit routes, the 30 km / h as standard agglomeration
(concept of the "City 306");
Encourage active commuting routes by developing "soft modes"
(walking, cycling) with access to local shops, health care and
community services (schools ...), green spaces, etc. ;
Regulate Parking7 in sets of housing and offices in the areas
adequately serviced by public transport. This approach presupposes the
definition of areas according to their accessibility by trains, trams and BUS8.
Dense cities, mixed and well equipped provide the opportunity to reduce dependence on the car
to take individual and collective lifestyles cheaper, healthier, safer, for
households and the community, less polluting and less resource intensive. They are therefore the
ideal implementation of the concept of "city near" where all services

To emphasize the transition to sustainable mobility, we must strengthen the available alternatives,
in a logic of multimodality: public transport, cycling, walking, car "Shared"
etc. In this context, it should strengthen the public transport system, starting
by dense areas of major cities, by the realization of surface lines in exclusive
providing a full level of service close to the metro (frequency, capacity, comfort). This option
is not only cheaper and more user-friendly, but above all much faster to set
implemented the construction of underground networks. It involves releasing a part of the space
public of the role played by the car. This allows to identify the space for functions
collective (friendliness, green areas) and mobility (comfortable sidewalks, own sites, trails
cycling).
To achieve these objectives, it is necessary to:
Enhancing multimodality in cities and between them;
Developing an offering of finely meshed transport;
Develop "Regional Express Network (RER)" cycle and systems
mechanized accompaniments (bike lifts, etc.);
Encourage the use of public transport to the workplace by reducing
facilities stationnement9 when the supply of transport permits. This approach presupposes
Also the definition of good accessibility to areas by trains, metro, trams and buses;
Finalize the RER around Brussels, opening up stations intra Brussels;
Implement the "Network Express Brussels" 10 (BWR) fully integrating the network
stations and existing routes and currently under-exploited by the SNCB, the network
Brussels public transport and in addition to RER11; Similarly, initiating the "Network
Liege express "and further exploit the rail network around the other major
Walloon cities reopening some breakpoints and expanding the parking
around the stations and stopping points;
Build and enable deterrent car parks on the edge of cities (ends of lines
metro, RER stations ...) and the most upstream paths;
Requalify "expressways" to "urban boulevards";
Imposing favorable adjustments to the bikes that are required according to the limitation
proposed speed during any new construction or major renovation of road
(cycle track and band logos rafters and bicycles, bicycle traffic streets, meaning
limited single (SUL), etc.) 12.

Proposal: Promote social and functional diversity
The mix is ​​a quality of life factor, allows substantial savings of énergie13, reduces
distances and encourages a modal shift towards active modes or public transport
common. It also offers better access to shops and services, promotes quality
life of residents and workers, encouraging the emergence of a social life and presents
social14 advantages in terms of control.
The scalability of an urban fabric also due to its versatility and complexity. In
Indeed, the mono-functional areas (areas dedicated exclusively to housing, offices

to shops, for example) and mono-social (one type of inhabitants) have a least
good capacity conversion and adaptation as multifunctional spaces and multi-social.
Architecturally Also, the minimum versatility of the buildings allows to consider their
adaptation or subsequent conversions.
Complementary concept to the mix, the porosity is a key concept to think
land use and urban planning. Each project (development of road or square,
subdivision, shopping center, train station, school ...) must take account of context and facilitate
pedestrians avoiding or eliminating the physical barriers and psychologiques15. he
be out of style "box chaussures16" where connections and interactions of the project with
its environment are reduced or nonexistent. The porosity has two advantages: it
promotes walking by multiplying the possible routes and shortening the distances; she
intensifying the use of public space and increases the possible interactions between public spaces and
private.
Ecolo therefore calls pour17:
Urban development based on the model of the cities and villages "short
distances18 "(see Priority 2);
Encourage diversity of functions and populations through management tools and
of urbanisme19;
Depending on the type of business and opportunities, sustainable and respectful insertion
of economic activity in urban and rural centers, in a logic of diversity
functional;
Insert the commercial function in urbanisés20 tissues;
Integrate the concept of porosity in all projects and facilities in order to promote
active transport (walking and cycling);
Linking together the private and public spaces in order to avoid barriers effects.

Proposal: Develop public spaces to improve the living environment
collective
In public space, means all passing and gathering spaces that are
the use of all. The public space, so this is part of the collective life of the inhabitants. he
provides a concrete expression of life and the exercise of freedoms: freedom to move, to speak,
express themselves, to communicate, to trade, to "breathe", to play, to manifest,
just "sit there" ...
Yet, public space is often considered solely in terms of travel:
cars, public transport, cycling, etc. It is also necessary to enhance the uses
collectives are made such as meetings, relaxation, play, sports, gardens, Horeca,

etc.
The green spaces and the presence of nature and water are neither a luxury nor a waste of space.
They are an asset as economic and social environmental good for a city,
village, a neighborhood. Green spaces are not the only carriers of a green network: the roads,

interior islets, railway tracks, residual spaces (wastelands, roadsides ...), buildings

In urban areas, green spaces and recreational play a major social role. They are used

Proposal: To revitalize neighborhoods to strengthen social cohesion
Logical urbaine27 renovation must evolve an approach aimed solely at the
a revitalization approach also aimed to improve capacity
to adapt to change (resilience). If revitalization programs aim to improve
the living conditions in deprived neighborhoods, strengthen social ties and boost y y
economic activity, the desire to strengthen the resilience of these neighborhoods makes more
Carefully, in a logic of urban ecology and social diversity, including the integration
the environmental issue and avoiding certain adverse effects such as gentrification28 neighborhoods.
In the Brussels Region:
Urban renewal policies must be continued and strengthened by integrating
balanced way the social, economic, and environmental. But these policies
must also evolve (sustainable neighborhood contracts, renovation grants, funds Feder etc.)
and bear primarily on the most degraded old neighborhoods. This development owes them
help increase the impact of their intervention, in a logic of opening up
troubled neighborhoods.
In addition, the realization of development projects is generally preceded by a long phase
planning, some sites (re) urban development often appear useless
for a certain period. This can have a negative influence on the surroundings. In addition,
presence of "useless space" is hardly acceptable given the high demand for places
open and public. Consequently, Ecolo supports reflection on the possible role of the temporary use
in planning espace29. By "temporary use" means the use directed, planned
or not an urban space, anticipating a "final use" of it in the medium to long term.
Urban renewal interventions should be articulated with wider policy
"Sustainable neighborhoods", to ensure a more structural response to the challenges of the region,
in terms of volume of public housing products, equipment to build, green spaces
regional, mobility infrastructure (tram lines, etc).
Given the success that the renovation operations occur in some areas of
hand, and considering the rise in property prices on the other, must be systematically
ensure, to the priority intervention areas offer significant cost housing
Boxes and social purpose to prevent the phenomena of gentrification30.
It should therefore be:
Focus on social housing and means of production (in coordination with
Development Company for the Brussels-Capital Region (SDRB)), production
of local facilities (nurseries, sports centers, local associations, swimming pools ...) and
the increased supply in terms of saturated public spaces in neighborhoods today
central, and where demand will only increase;
Strengthen centralities neighborhoods (or the creation of new centralities) by
the establishment of local shops, infrastructure development
... collective;

Steer contracts sustainable neighborhoods and other urban renewal policies on
treatment of physical urban boundaries (canal, boulevards, railways ...)
administrative (municipal boundaries), and other more psychological boundaries to
encourage residents to leave their place of living and around the city;
Entrust the project management of urban renewal schemes at a level
intercommunal or regional interventions and focus on strategic areas
defined in the Regional Plan for Sustainable Development (SDNP);
Implement urbaine31 renovation guide Plan.
Wallonia:
A series of tools exist but no real global policy for the city and urban cores
is implemented. If urban centers are recognized as major challenges for the
Wallonia, the political debate boils down too often to get more money without
transversely reflect on their efficient allocation in favor of the whole of the Walloon territory. Of
Moreover, even within cities, major disparities remain and testify to the difficulty
the current policy to ease urban tensions.
Therefore Ecolo insists:
Develop an integrated and coherent policy that targets and effectively using the resources
the benefit of the network of all the Walloon cities;
Develop a policy to give a framework of actions, objectives and means for
each of Walloon cities. This policy will allow each urban entity
build its own project without competition and with explicit objectives of solidarity
districts ;
Evaluate all existing tools (renovation, revitalization, rehabilitation of sites
renovate and polluted, rural development) to integrate into an overall policy and
effective ;
Develop a comprehensive policy, integrated and coherent building neighborhoods,
Like the Brussels districts contracts to better target and use the means in
redéfinir32 priority areas.
Moreover, in view of the regionalization of the Federal Urban Policy, Ecolo
wishes:
Goodbye, given their current lack of transparency as the criteria for selection of cities and
common that the distribution of moyens33;
Pursue the objectives determined in the context of sustainable city contracts and integrate
existing policies in urban areas (urban renewal, contract
neighborhood improvement of the living environment, utilities ...).

Proposal: Develop a keen creative architecture heritage
Today's architecture is tomorrow's heritage. Now the quality of production
Contemporary architecture is not sufficiently promoted. Governments therefore have to show
the example in this field and stimulate innovative experiences. Architecture and urban planning are
essential levers for improving quality of public space and integration of new
challenges such as climate change. The approval of a neighborhood, but also the variety,
quality and richness of its architecture.

33
See Report of the Court of the 2007 accounts.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter PLANNING - p 8/23

Ecolo therefore proposes:
Generalize the architectural competition and planning for public projects. These
remain very marginal in French-speaking Belgium, as they are applied successfully
Furthermore, and they lead to transparent and creative choices;
Impose the obligation to establish an architectural and urban programming for
public projects of a certain size (public square, nursery, school, town hall,
sporting or cultural center, museum ...) to accurately define the project issues and
responses to optimize expenditures;
Déterminer34, in big cities, areas where changes will be prohibited
important template and urban scale by defining an urban landscape
("Skyline35").
Wallonia:
Write the regional planning guide (GUR - see below) 36, taking advantage of the value y
creative architecture;
Establish a regional scale, a architecte37 Master (multidisciplinary team:
lawyer, architect, urban planner, sociologist ...) whose main mission is to help teachers
to work to ensure the quality of architectural and landscape-scale projects
Regional: identification of project issues, constraints and means to solve
to get there, help in drafting the tender documents, setting up of a committee
reviews, and monitoring of the project ...; Master architect will work closely with
the regional administration;
Organize training for public operators (designers and administrations
active in the territory of Wallonia).
Moreover, heritage is both a factor of identity and ownership of our history tool
past and present. To transmit this heritage to future generations, it is important to
preserve but also to keep it alive. As in the Brussels Region and Wallonia, there is still
many initiatives to the overall protection of built cores or character
certain areas or neighborhoods beyond the protection of isolated elements. Special attention
should be given to heritage 'endangered', often linked to architectural periods less
popular, such as the architecture of post-war (1960-1990).
To do this, it is important to:
Better reconciliation "legal protection" and "dynamic management" of heritage by ensuring
balanced regulation between the necessary protection and creative redevelopment
which integrates sustainable development (energy efficiency and production) and accessibility
persons with reduced mobility when restorations;
Accelerate protection procedures, renovation and development of property
classified;
Encourage increased so the protection and enhancement of the local heritage
daily ;
Writing books thematic recommendations in consultation with the
Royal Commission on Monuments and Sites (CRMS) on the chassis, small
Heritage, coatings, etc. to serve as "guidelines" for the project authors.

Create in Brussels Code of Planning (CoBAT) a "certificate heritage"
like the planning permission, that is to say an application which deals

listed buildings in which assent is required to indicate to the applicant
direction must take his project.

PRIORITY 2: ACHIEVE ALL AND ALL HOUSING AND WELL LOCATED
DEVELOP SUSTAINABLE HOUSING
The population is changing: the phenomena peculiar to contemporary society (decreased
household size, population aging) in addition to the expected accroissement38
Brussels and Walloon populations. This requires the creation of new housing (new
construction, renovation, reallocations ...) to meet the new needs of
population. The location of these units is part of the essential issues to be addressed from the point
of view of planning.

Proposal: Ensuring everyone a well-located housing
Establish the model cities and villages "short distances"
The dispersion of the habitat and the distance from home to the place of work or services,
generate high costs for both the individual (budget travel, losses
time, stress, risk of accidents ...) and for society (creation and management of roads, dispersion
utilities, various types of pollution, lost productivity ...).
A sustainable land must seek a better articulation between habitat,
services, economic activities, leisure, etc. This requires them centering on
existing towns, functional diversity, efficient provision of public transport and
favorable arrangements with travel active modes (walking, cycling).
In Wallonia, Ecologist intends to implement the Codt (Territorial Development Code) to
intensify and reasonably densify the frame, taking into account the quality of life for residents
and to preserve natural areas (agricultural and environmental) and limit travel.
This design is based on the model of "short distances", whereby the center, urban or
rural, and the main services are within walking or cycling. Different types of centers, that
we now call "central areas" can be distinguished: the major centers
which are an urban center in their area of ​​influence (big cities) to smaller centers
suburban or rural. In these central areas, areas can be defined according to
the possibility to travel faster at the center on foot or by bike.
It will be important therefore that municipalities identify their core territories to consolidate
premises by centrality of strengthening the functional and social diversity, optimal densification
the frame and the upgrading of public space.
Promote the intensity, diversity of uses and functions, density
Before talking about densification by building new buildings, a fine analysis (to
the neighborhood level and even buildings) should identify existing buildings whose uses
may be intensified. Stepping is more and better use of existing open space, which
are often underused in relation to their potential. Is allowing more opportunities
activity, more opportunities to meet and therefore social relations.

38

Wallonia should host the next 2030 430 000 additional people an increase of 12% compared to
2010 Brussels, 261,000 additional inhabitants, an increase of 24% over the same period (source Office
Plan, 12/2011).

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter PLANNING - p 10/23

The intensity of the activities in a building may vary depending on the vertical scale (on
different étages39) but also according to the time scale (Examples centers
Educational host another evening activity or weekend).
Some geographic areas conveniently located (see above) but under-used, must be
densified.
This reasoned densification should consider:
The introduction of mixed use and function in tissue monofunctional frame;
Quality of life by improving or increasing green spaces
breathing, the development of quality public spaces and encouraging meetings
active mobility (walking and cycling), the use of creative architecture, quality and
resistant to wear time, reduced energy consumption of
... buildings.
The vertical and temporal intensity in planification40 documents;
The identification of zones or areas where the density can be increased in relation to
concrete and measurable parameters (accessibility, presence or potential of
utilities ...).
In the Brussels Region:
Define different densities according to the neighborhoods in the regulatory tools;
Soften the Regional Town Planning Regulation (RRU) to allow densification
reasoned the built fabric;
Wallonia:
Continue the implementation of the central areas by offering density targets
while maintaining a balance between urban areas on the one hand and the green frame and
blue on the other.
Finally, as the Brussels Region Wallonia will face a significant increase
the number of households. Although sufficient land reserves seem broadly to
regional level to meet the demand for land in 2026, the risk of saturation
land are present locally (Northern Sambre et Meuse and particularly
West of Brabant Wallon and Hainaut, for example), especially if no specific policy
is established.
In this context, Eco proposes:
Optimize the use of existing buildings and building areas (empty or underutilized buildings, unoccupied dwellings floors above shops, expansion possibilities
buildings, etc.);
Locate primarily new housing on previously urbanized lots and
located in the central territories;
Ensure optimal use of the soil (joint ownership, density, compactness ...) when
housing construction both in already urbanized plots than on plots
virgins.

Proposal: Improving the energy performance of buildings and reuse
existing
Improve environmental and energy performance of peri-urban areas
Urban sprawl generates significant social costs and long-term impacts not
negligible on the environment, the living environment and paysages41. The culture of urban sprawl,
inherited from previous decades, must evolve toward a culture of management of the existing. It is necessary

learn to consider the space built like a well-to value and not a handicap.
Priority should be given to reducing energy demand. The savings potential
energy through the renovation of existing buildings is substantial and allows nonnégligeable creating non-relocatable jobs (see Job Alliance - Environment).
Among the scenarios renewal of existing peri-urban areas, besides renovation
pushing energy, densification of built déterminant42 must be a criterion. Priority should be
filling of the hollow teeth (not built spaces inserted into a built environment); There
Land bottom construction or interior of a block, must be considered on a case by case basis
depending on local conditions and in compliance with the existing templates. The suburban retain
and its "assets" (green environment) but its energy impact would be minimized.
To this end, Ecolo offers:
Realize the potential identified land (land) mobilized;
Establish a facilitator to promote "individual" sector called "bimby43"
of evaluating with private landowners expansion possibilities of the built or
division of their land and / or housing in order to develop a new or
housing in compliance with quality standards. This approach is participatory and
can be done obviously with the agreement of the owners;
Intensify public sector via the renovation and revitalization urbaines44;
In the Brussels region, exempt from planning permission for insulation work
outside roofs and rear facades (except for buildings classified or in
perimeters of heritage protection).
Recycling existing buildings
By taking care of existing buildings and seeking to reuse, we apply the principle of use
parsimonious ground. The reuse of existing buildings or demolition and reconstruction
also allows to benefit from these infrastructures and to avoid the costs of servicing that
the authorities must take in case of new urbanization (roads networks,
distribution, drainage, etc.). The reuse of open space can finally monetize better
existing equipment and services (schools, shops, sports centers, etc.) and not to have
build new ones.
For these reasons, it is necessary:
To reflect and predict when drawing up the plans, opportunities for retraining
(housing office, for example) of new construction (depths
circulations, size of rooms, etc.) 45;

To realize the identified potential land (buildings) mobilized;
To guide the renovation and urban regeneration policies in logic
reuse rather than demolition / reconstruction46.

Proposal: Encourage innovative forms of housing
Faced with the housing crisis, it is free of other forms of housing that can be qualified
alternatifs47 of habitats, which have undeniably proven. This is to find a place
and a framework for solutions that people put themselves in place in a context of
shortage of suitable housing.
The new forms of housing should be encouraged, whether in terms of access to
ownership or lease (co-location, cohousing, supportive, intergenerational house
kangaroo, Split ...) and be recognized by the authorities.
Ecolo therefore proposes to develop the Community land trust projects (CLT) 48 which aims
to provide low or moderate income families building plots or
buildings to be renovated via long leases. Thus, the starting price of the land or
to renovate the building is significantly reduced and secondly, the Community Land Trust
retains ownership of the land so that, when you sell a lot, pick up part of the
capital gain for reinjected into purchasing new land or production
new logements49.
In Wallonia, it is also necessary to create a zone area plan "alternative housing" to
provide a stable legal status to this type of habitat and allow public investment
within a clear legal framework. The definition of such a zone is also a bulwark against
foncière50 the speculation.

PRIORITY 3: BOOSTING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY RELATED RESOURCES
TERRITORY
The question of the location of economic activity may be treated differently depending on
urban, peri-urban or rural context. If the presence of certain activities in town can sometimes pose
the problems, the tertiary sector (offices and services), which represent a
important part of the economy and its direct environmental impacts are relatively
low, should be a priority for against localized in existing urban areas while
respecting the principle of diversity of functions.
The location of activities in the urbanized core and close to transport hubs
Public can limit commuting or perform preferentially
transport. The private car commuting indeed weigh
heavy on the finances of households and public authorities on the environment.

46

See Priority: Building a favorable quality of living for social cohesion.
Trailers, campers, small cottages, tents, huts, or other yurts, reuse disused vehicles are ...
Today the most common forms of this habitat says AC but other particularly innovative projects

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter PLANNING - p 13/23

Ecolo promotes an economic model preserving and valuing non-urbanized areas. There
location of economic activity must take into account the economic viability and needs
the company and its workers, the compatibility of operations with the neighborhood, modes
access of people and goods, proximity to customers, equipment or
specific resources and complementarities between companies for their networking.
In Brussels, the economy localization issue takes a very important dimension because
the narrowness of the regional territory and population boom. The coexistence conditions
heavy industry and housing more and more become complex. In this
optical, Ecolo supports the clustering of economic activity incompatible with
urban functions to the north and south of the region along the canal (especially on the site
Schaerbeek training, where a road-rail-water multimodality may be considered). The new
green economy and economic activities compatible with the city can be accommodated thanks
the conversion of the industrial base inherited from the nineteenth century in the central part of the canal, in a
logic of urban diversity.

Proposal: To develop a trade policy based on the businesses
retail and proximity
Issues of commercial establishments raise both socio-economic issues and
land use: commercial offices have an important impact on the
dynamic urban centers that differs depending on whether they are installed inside or outside
built cores. From a spatial point of view, retail trade concentrated in the nuclei
commercial and has spread to urban peripheries, following the process of
suburbanization of housing.
The commercial function should be better integrated into the urban fabric, to mix with the habitat and other
functions to become accessible to everyone through sustainable means of transport and
priority means of transportation assets that are walking and biking.
Therefore Ecolo wishes:
Protect and promote the retail and proximity inserted into the tissue
urban and rural centers, notably by promoting the availability of appropriate premises,
improving accessibility for customers, organizing a good cohabitation with
habitat (deliveries, waste, etc.), by upgrading public space. Commercial dynamism
and urban quality are closely linked: the shops of well integrated fabric qualities
Urban contribute to the attractiveness of an area and vice versa, a lively and
attractive promotes the growth of local commerce;
Reject disconnected projects of their type environment centers and zonings
trade to benefit the enhancement of existing commercial infrastructure and
development of retail and proximity;
Adapt commercial implementation projects with sustainability and accessibility criteria
developed above and include: the location (close to bus or train station)
Project adjustment to the area where it is implanted (architecture, template ...) the
Project porosity allowing a large pedestrian mobility (entry, exit, circulation
and around the project), the limitation of the square dedicated to infrastructure-related traffic
automobile and parking, the opening of the project on its environment and its
multifunctionality (windows, many entries, verdurisation buffer areas,
public green space, meeting and conference rooms, exhibition, library ...), the

cultural …) ;

Common policy on business development;

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter PLANNING - p 14/23

Develop commercial housing agencies that support, on behalf of
owners who wish, managing their commercial ground floor like
what is done for housing with social housing agencies (AIS);
As in the Brussels region in Wallonia, pursue a strategy
primarily commercial development to support and develop trade
retail and proximity in the urbanized core.

Proposal: Reinstate of economic activity in the urban cores
Urban sprawl companies is becoming more significant and worrying about its
ecological footprint: use of agricultural land, increased distance traveled,
soil sealing, etc. The establishment and maintenance of production enterprises,
processing and compatible with the urban services must be encouraged (activities
craft, urban agriculture ...). To do this, two main conditions are essential:
the supply of urban sites as activities and the protection of quality of life
residents.
If the implementation of economic activities in town is an asset for development
sustainable community and entreprises51, urban nevertheless has certain
handicaps: cost and scarcity of suitable land or buildings, environmental constraints
stricter (noise, air pollution), less easy accessibility by road (trucks, areas
maneuver, noise pollution ...), possible opposition of local residents (noise and
olfactory, carting, air pollution or soil ....) etc. Where possible and that it is not harmful
quality of life, we must work on these parameters in order to remove unnecessary obstacles.
The environmental zoning Bas52 developed in the Netherlands aims to ensure spatial separation
sufficient between high-impact companies and sensitive areas in terms
environmental. The importance of this separation is variable depending on the extent of pollution
generated. From an analytical framework, the authorities can take the necessary measures
(plans and regulations) to ensure a harmonious development of housing as
economic activity.
This may be associated with development planning of economic activities
depending on their accessibility. Denmark (Copenhagen) or Switzerland (Canton of Bern)
the extension of the transit network has the opportunity to define new areas
Home for business. In the Netherlands, companies are oriented towards certain
maps according to their mobility profile, in order to ensure the most judicious location
each activity ("53 ABC" policy).
Finally, intermunicipal economic development, which is essentially to finance
from the sale of industrial land, tend to develop more business parks
economic periphery. The general interest requires to reflect on funding

The ABC policy is the matching principle places of accessibility and mobility profiles profiles
activities in order to maximize the use of public transport. The activities are classified into three profiles of mobility
(A, B and C). A are "intensive" activities in space that primarily generate displacement, employees or
customers; C were the most extensive activities mainly generating freight; B is
somewhere in between. The places are also classified into three accessibility profiles (A, B and C) depending on the quality of the offer
transport. The profile consists of very accessible places these modes; in contrast, the profile C consists of
places inaccessible by those modes; B represents an intermediate situation. International studies
demonstrated that the location of a maximum activity "A" in places "A", allows the development of the use of
transport.

these intercommunal to counter the logic leading to the area of ​​non mitage54
urbanized.
In this context, Ecolo offers:
Offset the additional costs of the implementation of economic activities in urban areas by
system of positive discrimination.
-

In the Brussels Region: review the arrangements provided for urban employment areas
stimulated (ZEUS) to neutralize the effects aubaine55 and direct activity
in sustainable economic sectors and job creators;

-

Wallonia: evaluate and revise the existing regime being put through the system
free zones. It currently covers too broad a territory
(dilution moyens56) and do not specifically target the insertion of activities in
central territories (the entire municipality can be concerned) 57;

Develop a business location policy inspired by the "ABC" policy
Dutch to maximize the use of public transport;
Develop a methodology inspired by the environmental zoning (see above) to
set within the land use planning, economic activities based tolerated
Zone Type. The types of economic activities that are considered
compatible with the habitat (size, number of jobs, pollution, accessibility ...) must
also be defined;
Book autographed specifically for urban areas economic activity linked to
major flagship projects such as industrial ecology project / circular of mégaressourcerie, etc. ;
Convert brownfields into mini-zonings of economic activity through a process
comparable to that which governs the creation of economic activity zones "classical"
usually located on the outskirts of cities: the operator (of the intermunicipal
Development example) acquires the Site, cleans if necessary, and subdivides the team;
Set up a database to identify potentially land
available for the reintegration of economic activity in urban areas;
Improving business service and limit heavyweight nuisances via
service "fine" Deposit / livraison58 with more modest dimensions of vehicles, better
adapted transport volumes and less polluting. The goods are then

Develop freight transport by rail or waterway as soon as
infrastructure exists, and compatibility with the transportation of people (by the night
example).
In the Brussels Region:
Set up in the changes CoBAT a compensation mechanism

Urban sprawl or "snacking" is the progressive installation of buildings in non-urban landscape. We are talking about
sprawl to mark the fact that this phenomenon is insidious: a construction appears, then another ....

Even without this device, companies are investing in the areas concerned, regardless of premiums

sufficient quantity. Thus, when equipment area or economic activity is
converted to area offices or housing (assignments that make the field a
high economic value), this is to compensate this loss. An area dedicated to housing
or office is then converted to affected area equipment or activity
economic ;
Reserve certain areas for activities incompatible with habitat (part of the outer harbor
Schaerbeek training), which frees the central areas for
economic functions compatible with the residential function (convert Basin
Biestebroeck of the basin and the TIR Vergotte center of the district in this regard).
Wallonia:
Create, wide living areas, a business support operator (-window
single) 59 or strengthen inter-mission for approaches, research
of land or a building, obtaining the required permissions, contact with
residents or information available on the various premiums and aid. These missions
could be complemented by the implementation of different monitoring tools (land and
available buildings, profile existing activities by neighborhood, accessibility card ...)
to guide the entrepreneur in his choices.

Proposal: To better organize and profitable existing business parks
Some companies require very large areas, others activities
incompatible with residential areas, others must be located near
agricultural activities or waterways, etc. All companies do not have their place in
Urban.
The analysis of the companies present in the parks of suburban and rural activities, however,
showed that nearly a third of them are located in generally located away parks
all built kernel then they are perfectly compatible with the residence (ex. services
persons or undertakings, crafts ...). This is particularly the case of some parks
scientists. The small regional control over the activities that occupy business parks
economic (significant presence of shops or warehouses) and loss of control
land by the sale of land by the government entail the saturation of some parks
as well as blocking certain strategic plots (those that provide access to waterways
or rail, for example).
Finally, the recycling of old business areas (brownfields) still offers
many possibilities for the location of various economic activities.
So advocates of Ecolo:
Continue the policy of reallocation of old industrial sites;
More intensive use of the park space activities by working on the mode
implementation and urbanism: from 15-20% of surfaces used can be saved
with more sound installations;
Book autographed specifically for large areas of industrielle60 ecology projects;
Develop and promote eco-zonings61;
Retention and fight against land speculation by imposing, in the land purchase
by a company, an obligation to build on the two thirds of the plot and a delay
implementation for the realization of the work;

Strengthen public control of land, for example through the use of leases
Annual lease or surface rights. In the same vein, to avoid
creating cankers, it should consider how to ensure public monitoring in case of
disappearance of a business and the maintenance of certain types of activity in zonings in
If a user changes locations;
Establish and maintain a database relating to business parks and
to companies that are present and the existing availability, in order to study
monitor and facilitate the provision of land for businesses;
Reserve land accessible by water and rail companies that operate
the full potential of these modes;
Strengthening the modal share alternative parks road activities for both
goods (facilities access to the waterway infrastructure and reopening
rail) and workers (arrangements for active modes and
transport).

Proposal: Preserving agricultural areas, forest and corridors
green
It is essential to preserve sufficient farmland to ensure production
Food quality and proximity, and a large forest area which, in addition to its
landscape and recreational importance, is a valuable source of energy, materials
construction and emplois62.
These spaces, which support existing ecological corridors or strengthen must be managed
to meet basic environmental issues: groundwater quality and water
surface, fight against floods, maintenance and landscape design, maintenance of
biodiversity, climate regulation ... Their roles must be strengthened and their value must be
reconsidered, since they are still considered as waste spaces
urbanization.
In general, it should therefore be:
Strengthen agricultural and forestry functions of these spaces, improving their connections
and the quality of all the green and blue network;
Protecting these spaces of land speculation;
In the Brussels Region and in the big cities of Wallonia:
Develop urban agriculture, especially vegetable growing proximity (wasteland,
roofs, balconies, gardens, interiors of islands, parks, public spaces ...) 63.
In the Brussels Region, convert Neerpede area agricultural area to serve the city
to increase the share of local and seasonal products;

PRIORITY 4: MAKE THE PLANNING POLICY
PARTICIPATORY
The cultivation of land and urban planning and citizen participation
in these areas must be developed. Indeed, many citizens do not perceive
land than as a regulatory policy related requests
62

31% of Walloon territory consists of forest areas accounting for over 80% of the Belgian forests. The timber sector
Wallonia represents nearly 13,000 direct employees jobs in more than 2000 companies.

See Chapter "Food and Agriculture" and the proposal "Promoting urban agriculture".

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter PLANNING - p 18/23

permit. This strict regulatory relationship feeds a negative perception of this
policy. But land offers the unique opportunity to reflect and build
territory positively, collective and prospective. We have seen above, land
key territory closer everyday life and the living environment of the inhabitants: commerce, mobility,
green spaces, housing ... It is thanks in part to land we can
meet the challenges of population growth, the need for energy savings and energy
renewable, development of sustainable mobility, social cohesion and
economic development. Information and participation64 decision-making processes are
Key enabling everyone to identify, understand and (re) take action on these issues.
Every citizen is a "developer" when it chooses its place of habitat, builds or renovates its
housing, uses a mode of transport ... So, to ensure that citizens are more actors
sustainable development of their territory, it is important to:
Continue work on extension of the territory planning tools and
laws governing them;

Ensuring efficient access to information: active advertising, document readability, Entertainment
meetings and management of the process by a third party independent of local power;
Consult stakeholders and citizens about issues and development priorities
territorial (local, regional and federal) by organizing consultations
Popular;
Invite people to participate in the various places of exchange (consultative committees,
Public Inquiries ...);
Valuing process that put the citizen at the heart of decision making and
organize citizen participation in upstream projects like the practices that
develop in sustainable neighborhood contracts in the Brussels Region (commissions
district) 65;
Ensure that the opinions expressed represent as much as possible, not just the
Review of the most active citizens, including members of organizations, but opinions
emanating from the whole of the population concerned.
In the Brussels Region:
Continue posting of information via the platform NOVA66 (introduction of
Online Planning records, publication of public inquiries ...);
Greater harmonization urban practices common between them to ensure
more consistency and equal treatment for all Brussels (clarification
the interpretation of texts through circulars, training of officials and establishment
a library of texts incorporating case law);
Improving the quality of urban information provided by the authorities on the occasion

owners.

Improve response times and material conditions of access to records and
presentation of data in the framework of public inquiries;
Clarify the scope of implementation and functioning of support committees
enable cooperation and dialogue between the population, government, office
study and the project proponent (before, during and after the implementation of a project);
Create a regional internet platform for the management of files relating to

edit online data of his file and follow live progress of
thereof;
Continue and intensify the training of municipal representatives, members of the CCMTA,
officials and design consultants regional and urban planning (CATU)
Ensure that the area covered by urban houses, whose missions are
educate, inform, organize dialogue, debate and communication for all
matters relating to land use and urban planning, match
the whole territory of the region.

PRIORITY 5: IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE TOOLS FOR SPONSORS
EFFICIENT TERRITORIAL DEVELOPMENT
Territorial development needs of the initiative, skills and resources of the sector
private but it must serve the common interest and regional development must be framed
by public authorities. For Ecolo, various tools are set up to guide projects
and operators. These tools are of three types: planning, management of operations and
land control.

Proposal: Implement efficient planning tools
Both in Brussels and Wallonia Region, a key tool update work was
conducted. The Regional Development Plan (RDP), the Walloon Code of spatial planning,
Urban Planning, Heritage and Energy (CWATUPE), the diagram space development
Regional (SDER) were evaluated and modernized according to the new challenges facing our
companies. The challenge now is to implement these new tools: Development Code
Territorial (Codt), Regional Plan for Sustainable Development (SDNP) and the new SDER.

Proposal: Provide oversight of operations
Governments must develop operators at a regional level or that of areas
strategic (such as living areas), able to undertake operations with a field
rather wide action: housing, economic development, equipment, green / public spaces,
mobility, etc. They must be able to intervene both on public land and on land
private.
In the Brussels Region, Ecolo offers:
Redirecting existing missions of the Development Corporation for Region
Brussels (BRDA) integrating more strongly and economic missions
residential, and widening its scope. The objective is to strengthen projects
including mixed housing and economic activities;

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter PLANNING - p 20/23

Develop a legislative framework for the creation of mixed-economy companies (SEM) whose
role would be to finance urban development projects in strategic areas identified by the
PRDD. The government would hold the majority of shares.
In Wallonia, it must:
Launch a reflection on the missions and organization of operators (type
intercommunal) to broaden their scope (housing, public spaces ...) and the
transformed into local development agencies;
Create planning agencies established throughout living areas. They would have to
aims to inform policy-making by developing knowledge of the territory. Their
including missions would capitalize the knowledge of the territory, to identify
needs, set priorities, identify the sites likely to receive
development and to the study of master plans and plans for the masses
to show an overview of a project;
Develop a Master architecte67 (multidisciplinary team: lawyer, architect,
urban planner, sociologist ...) whose main task would be to help building owners for
promote quality architectural and landscape of regional projects;
Provide technical expertise to strengthen the environmental component of
projects both across the building as part of the implementation of facilitators
within the administration (buildings, sustainable neighborhoods ...).

Proposal: Develop a regional strategy for land management
Land policy addresses the developers of raw material, that is to say the land on
which we will build or not build .... This policy can be defined as all acts
public authority to have an impact on the value, ownership and / or use of
land. It covers all land, regardless of the activity that is permitted or contemplated. The
tools and means of action that together form a land policy are very divers68.
This policy addresses an issue of financial equity, but is also a key to reform
the sol69 use plans. Thus, if regions want to give themselves the means to reorganize their
territory, so if necessary to compensate property losses that would entail,
they must also provide the means to capture the gains that also generate
land use plans where no building area becomes buildable.
Land management is a prerequisite for successful major projects
development. Regions therefore must develop effective tools for land acquisition
(land governed by example) necessary for the implementation of these projects. The municipalities also
via local property Authorities can optimize and develop land control
acquisition strategies of real estate and land.
That is why it is necessary to:
Promoting long lease on public land on operations to keep
Public control of land use;
Strengthen the system loads of urbanisme70 order to charge to developers
the costs generated by their projects that would otherwise be borne by the public:

Development of codes of territory and housing, income Tax Code, the Civil Code, the Human Rights Code
registration, mortgage and court, budgetary decrees ...
69
PRAS PPAS and in the Brussels Region, Sector Plan in Wallonia.
70
In Flanders, the form is radical because any land over 0.5 hectares is assessed between 10 and 40% housing
social or modest. In the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, for any project of a hectare or more, 10% of the area must be
affected by housing. In France, the State authorizes municipalities to determine the loads at sub-area level, which sometimes can go up to 50% social housing sector
68

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter PLANNING - p 21/23

creation of infrastructure (roads, égouttages, connections), spaces arrangements
public, creation of public facilities related to the project, etc. ;
Support the development of local land authorities, across the catchment area,
including by strengthening existing regional funding.
Note that, to avoid the adverse effects and to be effective, most of the land tools
should not be applied uniformly over the entire territory.
In Wallonia, Ecologist proposes:
Activate a cell "land policy" within the administration which would follow
pre-emption and expropriation and would ensure the effective use of existing tools;
Organize within that cell, land observation (taking into account prices
local market) at regional and local levels to enable the development of tools or
ciblés71 measures;
Create a regional database containing the the land observation data
and other existing data as areas of constraints, sector plans
and communal development plans (BCP), urban land consolidation perimeter,
land use ...
In the Brussels Region, Ecolo offers:
Implement a proactive public land management strategy, through reorganization
public operators such as land acquisition Society (FAS). This operator would
responsible for strategy and prospective land. It would also be prime contractor
(phasing of projects, allocation of lots, developer for public spaces ...)
in strategic areas defined by PRDD;
Reform the pre-emptive right of the device to make it more flexible and effective,
particularly to better target the types of concernés72 property;
Establish a system for capturing gains of assignment changes
ground.

71

Database transaction values, register of unbuilt plots permit register, register
pre-emptions, register of building charges and register of gains and losses due to changes in assignments
72
The perimeter is often too broad and all goods taken in are subject to pre-emptive right as they
not interested any public authority.

Environmental Justice
MOBILITY and TRANSPORT
Clever move, move healthy, serene move
Status and political horizon
State of play
Mobility is an intrinsic part of our daily lives. It is not a day without it
invites itself into our lives, whatever our age, geographical anchorage or our situation
social, work and family. It is sometimes a source of relaxation, pleasure or shared
Nearby, sometimes associated with the stress, insecurity or slowdowns.
Thus, the cities and their surroundings, in particular, are regularly saturated by traffic. The number
growing car and truck causes considerable problems health1,
congestion or even gridlock, always greater influence on space
public and degradation of living conditions in neighborhoods and villages.
We also note that, in the medium and long term, the demand for mobility fits
offer - at least as far as the opposite. Transport supply in fact exercised an influence
considerable on the choices of households and businesses in localization. So,
increased road infrastructure, ostensibly to improve traffic flow or blow
a bottleneck, facilitates the dispersion - usually, relocation - activities
production and distribution, while also promoting the dispersion of the habitat. At the end
a while, it inevitably results in a further increase in transport demand,
new bottlenecks and new demands for increased infrastructure.
These developments are particularly associated with the conversion of agricultural land in urbanized areas,
soil sealing and biodiversity loss.
On the fiscal side, the amounts needed to maintain our road system will cease to
grow, but our society is living beyond its means in the matter. Moreover, even if the
trend for several years to a reduction in the number of road accident victims, the
number of traffic accidents, fatalities and serious injuries, remains important in our country
compared to neighboring countries. Here, too, there is clearly much to
do.
Finally, while it is true that it is at local level that the various effects of uncontrolled mobility
will notice the most is comprehensively rethinking it. In Belgium as
Europe, the transport sector - in particular road and air sectors - remains
excessively dependent on non-renewable fossil fuels and is, by itself,
responsible for about one quarter of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). It is the source
main emissions of fine particles harmful to health. It is also the main
sector whose emissions continue to significantly increase year by year.
1

In urban areas, traffic is by far the largest source of emissions of other pollutants and microparticles
atmospheric, seriously threatening the health. Studies in the Clean Air for Europe program
(CAFE) showed that PM2.5 in the atmosphere are reducing the life expectancy of European
over 8 months on average. In Belgium, the reduction of life expectancy is estimated at 13.6 months. Circulation is
also the main source of noise for the population, particularly in cities and Region
Brussels where it is estimated that 39% of the population is exposed to over 55dB average day and 47%
more than 45dB average night.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter MOBILITY AND TRANSPORT - p 1/30

As we see, our mobility is a source of many challenges and the sooner we will bring answers to
these challenges, the less it will cost us to do, and to future generations. Fortunately,
benefits of mobility measured, respectful of the environment, better integrated in space
public, are friendly and often most economical appreciated by a growing share of
population. For Ecolo, it is up to governments to create the conditions for mobility
plural which, while leaving a reasonable place in road transport, allows transport
common, shared transport and active modes (walking, cycling, etc.) to find a place
certain and safe in the distribution of travel.

The political horizon Ecolo: safe mobility, efficient and multimodal
The challenges of mobility in line with those of spatial planning and urbanism.
Analyzed in this light, the issue of mobility is giving way to that of accessibility. Indeed,
the important thing is not to "move to move", but rather to ensure that each and every one, the
opportunity to have contact with others, to access a business or service (employment,
health, education, trade, job, sport, culture ...) in an effective and attractive way. This
means not only to act in time on territorial planning and location
functions and associated equipment but also an effective sharing of spaces
circulation, to make room for each mode focusing on more transport modes
sustainable and those consuming less space per passenger.
Acting on the demand for mobility also involves a broader reflection on possible
perverse effects of taxation on transport and on incentives to predict or to edit
preferred means of transport, the most sustainable vehicles and fuels, that is to say,
less pollutants in the respect of greater social equity. In this regard, it should
including gradually overcome the various mechanisms that lead to action
inconsiderate to the aircraft as well as excessive dependence on the private car. It is well
to prevent over-use by providing real alternatives, attractive enough.
This requires in particular a strengthening of the supply of transport, improving
security and the role of active modes in traffic, the use of carpooling,
development of car and bike sharing networks, but also by the development of
trade and local services. Indeed, we must not only make modes
more efficient alternative. It should also be attentive to the needs that the car can
meet to try to answer it by alternative means. Household purchases appear in
prominent among these needs. For Ecolo, facilitate localization and supply
shops in the inner cities, villages hearts and within urban areas, rather than
the fringe thereof, is therefore also an objective important2.
Beyond measures to influence the transport demand and to optimize the role of
each mode in the mobility of people as commodities, should also be
ensure by mode, the generalization of equipment and safer behaviors and
the most environmentally friendly.
Safe mobility, efficient and multimodal indeed requires the mobilization of all:
Governments at all levels and their different executive bodies, of course, but also
civil society, trade unions and businesses, schools and every citizen.

The main points of the Ecolo project for mobility are:
Improve accessibility of goods and services
Give railways new international ambitions, national, regional and
Metropolitan
Make transport less harmful goods and logistics for
the environment

2

See also the proposals of the Chapter "Spatial Planning".

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter MOBILITY AND TRANSPORT - p 2/30

Double in 10 years the modal share of public transport and shared
Ensuring safer and more welcoming for all road users, cyclists and
including pedestrians
Prioritize sustainable modes of transport and ensure the right to a healthy environment
Developing sustainable mobility policies

Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: IMPROVE ACCESSIBILITY OF GOODS AND SERVICES
The accessibility of goods and services we need, that is to say, the ease in terms of
time, comfort and cost with which we can access these activities or the property is
important for every citizen. Easy accessibility goes hand in hand with
territorial organization that reduces the net mobility needs without diminishing supply
overall material and immaterial goods and services to which everyone must have access.
A plural mobility, less dependent on the private car and less oriented
constant development of the road network is possible with the effective integration
alternative methods in development policies and planning. The success of modes
assets, first of all, depends not only on the part of short trips or reasonably long
in total displacement, but also the space that is allocated to them in the design
infrastructure. As for the attractiveness of public transport, it must be able to rely on
a public transportation system sufficiently meshed, regular services at affordable prices,
with comfortable vehicles. The operation of such a network is possible to socially costs
acceptable from a certain "demand density." Proximity and density
can be achieved through limiting urban sprawl, more location
appropriate activities (taking into account the impact of those choices on mobility) and
less design unimodal existing road infrastructure, particularly in
cities3.

Proposal: Locate the activities taking into account déplacements4
For Ecolo, improve mobility involves:
promote a mix of functions, bringing as much as possible housing,
shops, services, utilities, crafts, green spaces, etc. ;
take into account the mobility profiles of companies, administrations and equipment
collective facilities or during their removal and accessibility profiles
settlement areas available to prioritize locations for a
efficient public transport service;
favor a development of the network in the territory, taking into account how
major transport infrastructure and public transport networks structure
space, by assigning the nearest land stations and other nodes in the network
public transport, the functions to be more easily accessible to a number
High of people and the nearest land to the river access points and networks
Railway companies justifying the receipt and / or shipping loads
heavy or bulky;

facilitate through various devices (see below), the location and supply
shops in city centers and within urban areas, rather than the fringe
thereof;
encourage relocation, in our regions, production activities, particularly in the
food and agricultural sector, so as to favor short circuits and limit
distances traveled by consumer goods between the producer and the
consommateur5.

Proposal: To rebalance the sharing of public space
ease of use and safety
Ecolo wants to make room for Sustainable commuting face of growing up
has taken the car in recent decades. For Ecolo, it is in many cases
need to redesign public spaces to increase its environmental quality and
allow its appropriation by the people and vulnerable road users. Strengthening
usability and security are two priorities that determine the attractiveness of
public space and need to mobilize a wide range of measures.
Furthermore, the issue of major routes must also be addressed in all its complexity. If
is important to maintain a road network hierarchy for reasons both
operational and readability ways to travel, it is also important to protect
quality of life of people living or working along these axes. Road construction sites
70s and 80s have indeed created urban cuts, taking the form of repulsive spaces
in some neighborhoods. Particular priority should be given to the healing of these
spaces, if necessary by reassigning them to new functions more in keeping with their vocation
Urban (pedestrian, boulevards, "green corridors", etc.).
To retrieve areas to affect public transport, bicycles, pedestrians or to the
convivial public spaces, Ecolo means:
mobilize all the opportunities offered to appease 'moderate motor traffic and its
traffic speed in urban areas, so as to facilitate its coexistence with
safely active modes: meeting areas, pedestrian or semi-pedestrian,
30 or residential areas, streets reserved for games, bike streets, roads reserved
non-motorized traffic and possibly agricultural vehicles ...;
reduce transit traffic and traffic linked to the search of parking spaces
in centers urbains6 favoring loop routes and developing
selective and dynamic parking policies;
improve the regularity, speed and commercial transport traveling comfort
Public (trams, buses, school buses and tourism, taxi) and shall, in
Wherever possible, priority over car traffic on congested roads,
by suitable amenities: own sites, lock the important crossroads, control
traffic lights, etc. ;
mobilize the facilities and equipment of road for pedestrians and
cyclists: dating zones, cycle streets, paths and cycle lanes, one-way
limited, advanced stop line at intersections (also accessible notwithstanding motorbikes
electric motorized), multiplication of bicycle racks and two-wheel slots

rehabilitate and enhance pedestrian crossings (galleries, alleys, patios, etc.) and

Development of pedestrian paths and cyclists safe and accessible to everyone,
both within and outside urban areas;
support the creation of sustainable neighborhoods on easily accessible terrain, y
including outset of place to active modes and public transport;
ensure widespread in the public space, facilities security and facilitating
comfort people with reduced mobility (PRM): accessibility of stations, stations, Points

facilitate the supply and accessibility of shops in urban centers and
village centers, by providing delivery areas sufficiency, with access
regulated and effective monitoring of compliance of their use and the width and caregiver
sidewalk maintenance and equipment to facilitate the use of alternative means
(tram and bus, bicycle racks, bicycle sharing stations, etc.).

Proposal: Supporting the work organization to
reduce or spread business travel
The development of information technology and communications (ICT) allows us 8
to be more accessible without necessarily being physically present alongside
those with whom we must work, exchange, learn, etc. ICT, which
experienced tremendous growth in recent years and whose use became widespread and perfected
degrees in business, government, the academic community and into the
families, offer important alternative perspectives for part of our travels.
As develop and perfect distance learning methods,
Purchases and eGovernment services, videoconferencing devices and tools
remote collaboration, to name a few, new prospects
reduced demand movements are emerging.
For Ecolo, even if they obviously never replace our need for travel, and
taking into account that they are not suitable for everyone, a use of such devices
have a potentially significant impact on congestion of infrastructure including
road and public transport networks, particularly at peak times. It is the
even all initiatives to limit in space or spread out over time
business trips, the decentralization of business processes and teams
or the implementation of more flexible work schedules.
To take full advantage of these developments, it is appropriate to conduct a census of
functions may be an application of teleworking and desktop sharing and
to study more operationally all issues related to the partial work and home
with flexible schedules (in terms of integration in the enterprise, social links, wellness and
quality at work, impact on CO2 emissions ...). This theme should also be
of consultation initiatives within companies, within the scope of collective bargaining
between employers and employees to anticipate and avoid any drift in the matter. The balance sheet
this reflection could be the subject of information provision and sharing of experiences to
to identify and remove, where it is relevant, the reluctance to these modes of organization of
work.

PRIORITY 2: GIVE THE RAILWAYS OF NEW AMBITIONS
INTERNATIONAL, NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND METROPOLITAN
While remaining one of the safest modes of transport and one of the most reliable, the challenge of
rail safety also remains important. Rail transport has experienced in recent
years in our country, too many accidents and serious incidents. It is in this
chilling context Infrabel and SNCB are trying to catch up the considerable delay
accumulated by our railways for automatic train protection (systems
Braking reacting to impulses transmitted by signaling). It will still, however,
years to equip the entire network and trains SNCB and third operators
interoperable European standard in this area, the ERTMS9 after deployment, in an emergency,
a "national" solution less efficient and not interopérable10 (the TBL1 + system).
The challenge of security, which will be the next few years a significant budgetary effort,
is unquestionably adds that of punctuality. This punctuality, which the Group entities
SNCB never really managed to counteract the slow erosion since SNCB burst
unit in 2005, if not significantly lengthening journey times, is indeed a
the main causes of dissatisfaction among travelers.
Beyond these "fundamentals" of the rail where it's time to put good order, that is,
a real leap of vision, direction and ambition for rail qu'Ecolo calls
today. These include, among policy options to get back on track, structural reform
no real relation to the objectives of coherence and governance pursued, workings
endless, RER continually postponed, prestigious investments alongside, of
years, decrepitude, of Pharaonic infrastructure projects resulting lack of
'system' vision on insignificant improvements of the rail offer, the gradual decline of
service stations and on secondary lines, all mixed operating results
have failed, far from it, to stabilize the company's debt. Belgian Railways have
urgently need a new framework and effective control.

Proposal: Inflect, never to suffer, European policies
disintegration and liberalization of railways
Faced with coordination problems, degradation of punctuality and increased costs
faced by the SNCB Group since its split into three separate and independent entities, the
Federal Government has recently decided to return to this latest reform, in order to
re-simplify the structure of our railways.
Instead of going after this logic by reintegrating the various entities of the SNCB Group to
restore the unity of the administration (by entrusting the pricing and allocation of network access to a
independent body, as required by EU legislation), the Government, on the contrary,
preferred to rely unduly on European requirements to further enhance
even de facto separation between the infrastructure manager Infrabel and train operator
SNCB.
In order to liberalize the domestic passenger transport, the European Commission proposes
Today the European Parliament and the Council, not only to separate managers
infrastructure of railway undertakings, but also to increase the number of operators
present on each national network, first, liberalizing access thereto, and secondly by
splitting train operations into separate lots, entrusted by various tenders
railway companies.

9

For European Rail Traffic Management System.
That other operators are therefore not obliged to adopt and have therefore not adopted all.

10

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter MOBILITY AND TRANSPORT - p 6/30

For Ecolo, such an approach is far from having been proven in Britain, where she was
tested for nearly 20 years and is condemned today.
Therefore Ecolo calls during the current debates in the European Parliament and the Council for
refuse this additional liberalization, including for:
avoid the perverse effects and additional coordination problems resulting
fragmentation and further liberalization of the railways (openness to
competition within the passenger transport) which do not take sufficient
account the specificities of our country (dense, highly Services
interconnected ...);
oppose any possible obligation to provide infrastructure managers
disconnected objectives and realities of rail and cut business
end users of the rail system on the one hand, and to strengthen their monopoly by
taken into their fold the right to determine access charges and the allocation of train paths
networks (essential functions) on the other hand, two areas in which the powers
Public power should play a leading arbiter;
prevent separation of stations and maintenance workshops which, while up
welcome new operators if their capacity allows, should remain part
integral infrastructure operated by the incumbent;
prevent the imposition of the same model in all Member States, in contradiction with the
principles of subsidiarity and proportionality on which the European Union is founded,
despite the problems and cost overruns that the simple separation of managers
infrastructure and railway undertakings has already caused, particularly in Belgium;
encourage the development, at European level, information stations and
Booking communes, covering all rail services in the EU, even
Also the services offered by other collective modes of transport.

Proposal: Strengthen the strategic and financial supervision policies
rail and reform the governance of the SNCB Group
Since then, fortunately over, where management of SNCB invested money
taxpayers money lost in a road transport company (ABX), governance
Belgian railways seems never to have much left to be desired today. At the waltz
Ministers, which follow one another at breakneck pace in command of this "department" since
several years, has recently been added the series of appointments of the top managers
SNCB group, highlight an unfortunate structural reform, which has yet to be
work but everyone wonders how she could correct the disastrous effects
the division of SNCB into three entities.
In this context, heavy threats weigh today on the combined rail-road
Diffuse freight traffic (wagonload), the Government has just removed the last
financial support, gradually disappears. Other blunders are regrettable in
records of the train at high speed Fyra Belgian-Dutch, perpetual postponements in the implementation
implementation of the RER, which is announced today that without enlargement or duplication of
North-South junction, it will be very little, plans investments with maturities
continually pushed and exceeded budgets.
Given these facts, Ecolo means:
strengthen the role and means of action of the regulators rail11 orientation,
negotiation and monitoring of investment plans, management contracts and plans

Proposal: Develop the rail as the backbone of an offer mobility
sustainable international, national, regional and metropolitan
For Ecolo, the train must be much more than that to fully contribute to the
mobility of people and provide an efficient and reliable alternative to the private car. For
play such a role, the rail network and trains offer companion must be in
supplement the development of other transit and active modes, spine
backbone of a successful basic mobility offer by public transport, and that, both
Internationally, as on the national, regional and even metropolitan plans. This requires:
increase significantly the supply of trains on the busiest lines of the network,
to allow all and all but possible exceptions for short distances of
travel seated and in good conditions, which means the trains commissioning
suitable capacity and increased frequencies to, with few exceptions
Nearby, a supply at least one train per hour, systematically reinforced for cities
regional and larger cities;
ensure a better timing of the trains offer in the next transport plan
increase its amplitude by an expanded offer in the evenings and on weekends, so
particularly to connect the main cities and intermediate stations until
late evening, and complete this offer by efficient road links in partnership
with bus and coach operators;
invest as a priority in railway safety and improving reliability
and timeliness by rigorously monitoring needs renewal, maintenance
and modernization of the entire existing network, including local lines, and the
rapid deployment of automatic train protection systems meeting
the best performing European standards, as recommended by the Commission
special set up after the disaster in Buizingen;
enhance network performance in terms of capacity, efficiency and mesh,
by judiciously oriented investments, among others, the modernization of the

complete the RER, the SNCB Group designs primarily as a service vocation

essentially radial), demanding, in the Brussels-Capital Region, a service
finer, fuller and rhythmic, like "overground", complementary to the
Metro STIB (which we have become accustomed to call the Express Network Brussels
or BWR), so as to achieve, by 2025, the modal share of trips
intra-Brussels at least 10%;
develop an efficient rail offer, if necessary resorting to forms
of lighter operations (tram-train, light rail, etc.) as an alternative to modes
greediest transportation infrastructure, energy and staff, the more lines

offer truly attractive and clear prices, taking into account the specific needs and
the effective purchasing power of different categories of users.

Proposal: To renovate and revitalize stations and stopping points as poles

The first contact users with public transport services, whether by train, tram or
bus happens in stations and at stops. These must therefore be taken care
particular.
Ecolo supports in this regard:
a network of multimodal stations welcoming, secure, tailored to the needs of
disabled and easily accessible to pedestrians, cyclists, users of
Other transport and motorists;

12

Also our priorities in rail freight.
In this respect, it should be recalled that three lines (L36 to Leuven, Mechelen and L A25 towards Halle to 96) are already
equipped with four lanes and can therefore support now provides a RER.

13

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter MOBILITY AND TRANSPORT - p 9/30

better coordination between SNCB, other public transport companies and
municipalities with regard to the construction of stations and stopping points, the
schedule coordination and deployment of ticketing systems, pricing and
integrated information, permitting combined use of several modes and
easy connections;
reopening, modernization and development of stations, particularly in the context of
the implementation of rapid transit to optimize travel;
the presence in as many stations, railway staff and other
trained and paid service providers to inform and serve travelers, and
sufficient comfort of waiting, including all stations and stopping points unstaffed
(seats, protected shelters, bins, sidewalks clearances, display and announcement of
schedules, adequate and proactive information in case of disturbances ...);
the multiplication of points and bicycle rental points for shared cars (Cambio,
etc.) in all stations of large and medium-sized;
the implementation, in consultation with the local authorities concerned, of a larger plan
"Stations" to upgrade and better integrate and operate this important heritage
housing and land, preferably in there promoting intermodal and multiplying the y
services related to mobility or not (post dots, bicycles, ATMs,
local shops, kindergartens, etc.) or alternatively, by welcoming them, as part of
leases or leasehold, other activities or occupations (shops
diversified services, housing, etc.).

PRIORITY 3: MAKING THE FREIGHT LOGISTICS AND MORE
RESPECTFUL OF THE ENVIRONMENT
In 2011, the Belgian road network has transported the equivalent of 66.4 billion tonne-km
goods, against just 9.3 billion tonne-km waterway and 7.6 billion
tonne-km for the rail network. The trucks then adjudge about 80% of land transport
goods or few percent higher than the European average (75.5%). And this,
while we have a network of rivers and canals and a particular rail network
mesh and a considerable part of the conveyed goods are perfectly transportable
by other means of transport (containers).
As for passenger transport, Ecolo intends to promote multi-modality
freight transport and encourage the development and use priority modes
the safest and most environmentally friendly wherever possible. This
requires investment in the waterway, the rail network, ports and infrastructure
intermodal and incentives and promotion of the most appropriate modes,
function including tonnages concerned, the distances involved and the impact
environmental different modal options available. All in a context
particularly difficult for sustainable modes, characterized by lower volumes and
fierce competition in inland waterway transport and the gradual disappearance of diffuse traffic
(single wagon transportation) in rail freight, under the effects of a poorly designed liberalization.
At the local level, particularly in towns and cities, Ecolo intends to pay
special attention to the transport needs of the retail and trade sector. In
Indeed, the city is, by nature, a place of exchange, where deliveries and movements to
supplies are needed. Urban mobility policies have long favored
increasing traffic, especially to meet these needs, ignoring the principles of
Urban territorial planning and effective. This resulted in increasing difficulty to deliver the
city ​​centers and business districts, which itself has forced many businesses to
desert them in favor of more peripheral locations less congested time in

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter MOBILITY AND TRANSPORT - p 10/30

relying on the fact that "self-mobility" generalized would overcome the distances always
greater between locations of economic activity and trade and the most residential places.
These policies contributed to the lengthening of supply chains and, in addition, had as
direct impact of further increasing the number of cars on the roads. Indeed, the concentration
and, in the worst case, the exodus of a series of business today penalizes
public transit and active modes compared to the car.
The first challenge today is to find solutions to preserve the diversity of functions in
neighborhoods (trade, habitat, education, leisure ...) 14, taking into account their needs
respectively. This means that on the one hand, businesses must be supplied and that
local economic development must be supported, without affecting the quality of life of
inhabitants and contributing to the fight against climate change.

Proposal: Strengthen and promote the waterways, ports and
businesses related to Skippers
Since its liberalization in 1998 and the restructuring of its fleet through various programs
European, river transport has greatly modernized, offering shippers a mode
reliable transportation, economy and low emissions. The sector is nevertheless faced with
many challenges.
For Eco should be:
continue supporting efforts to Skippers begun under the 2009-2014 parliamentary term
to improve working conditions and training of boatmen and all those
living of this activity and make it live. Modernization of the training
by the skippers of Huy school and training centers should be used to include
develop business management skills of future boat captains, and,
preferably in a truly European framework. Indeed, promotion and fault
resources invested in training, the boatman profession is threatened in our regions,
lack of succession;
develop aid for the purchase or replacement of equipment and ensure
conditions of access to capital for inland shipping companies to allow more
smaller carriers to initiate and facilitate the creation of cooperatives or
independent professional body of sufficient size. Other types of support
the sector are also to be considered, for example in logistics support,
administrative, accounting, etc. ;
provide tax incentives for boatmen filters so they equip their engines
particles initially and acquire more performance boats in a
second time. Such measures should ensure that the renewal of the fleet
result in energy efficiencies as high as possible for new
boats. This incentive policy should not however cause a standardization
excessive fleets to avoid a relative shortage of smaller boats,
only capable of operating on some channels to smaller jigs;
strengthen the dredging and maintenance of inland waterways, beyond
priority plan already decided to move towards the restoration of the original beds, building
on structural funding mechanisms and continue to develop channels for
storage and treatment of dredgings;
allocate substantial financial and human resources to repair and
Maintenance of the main structures to enable the navigation of boats
capacity and limit the risk of flooding;

increase the size of several transnational axes crossing the wallon15 territory as
the waterway link Seine-Scheldt to large size (which should be an important
European co-funding) and to continue the development of its platform
including the multimodal "Trilogiport" Port Autonome de Liège. Finally, the
modernization of management tools and navigation aid tools
(remote control, remote control, River information services ...) also requires certain
investments;
reserve priority, given the relative scarcity of areas' waterways on board ", these areas
industries aspiring to use this mode of transport, as part of the policy
Location of economic activities:
-

In Wallonia, based on the inventory of port land uses carried out under
the 2009-2014 parliamentary term, it is to continue the characterization of these courses,
to establish a strategic development plan and to reserve the use for
able to capture new investment and jobs;

-

In Brussels, where the scarcity of available land along the canal and pressure
Real are particularly glaring, land reserves connected to the
waterway to the north and south of the region must be firmly assigned to
the expansion of port functions, logistics and industrial, to the benefit of
the economy and employment in the Region, or preserved for development
later these same functions;

modernize, simplify and further integrate the institutional landscape surrounding management

bear the costs. If we actually observed some beneficial effects on competitiveness
complete trains for which the railways, however, was already almost unbeatable, the slow agony
diffuse traffic has on the modal split with the road, the exact opposite effect to that
long promised by advocates of liberalization. At the same time, representatives of
Companies regularly express the need to develop a genuine transport policy
goods by rail.
15
Paying particular attention to vertical clearance of these in the context of increasing containerization of transport in general
and transport by water in particular.
Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter MOBILITY AND TRANSPORT - p 12/30 For Ecolo, it should:
increase reliability and speed of rail freight in this country in connection with the
major multimodal corridors and the central rail connections network
European transport (TEN-T), continuing to invest in maintenance,
renewal and improvement of lines (main roads and services) involved
freight traffic: template, load and interoperability, capacity increases,
removing bottlenecks, development of infrastructure and autographed
semi-autographed possible to provide grooves freight trains (rights)
performing without competing with passenger traffic, etc. ;
ensure sustainability, modernization and, where appropriate, infrastructure development
terminal (port or intermodal transshipment road-rail platforms) of
marshalling yards and branch lines used by freight traffic to
consolidate as much as possible around these infrastructure industries the most
likely to use rail for their transport, and put these infrastructures
available to a maximum number of operators, in consultation with their managers, and,
even when the transport concerned are in decline. Indeed, maintenance of these
infrastructure is a prerequisite for further revitalization of traffic
diffuse and development of combined transport in the coming years, only ways
really decongest the road network and reduce the nuisance caused all kinds
transport.
Proposal: Strengthen training and fight against social dumping and
environment in transport, including road, goods
As the boatman business, the truck driver's job is a tough job, both by
schedules and stress it entails, that due to the constraints just in time in which the
road usually operate, congestion that characterizes a growing part of the network
road and heightened competition prevailing in this sector, by international definition.
Despite a well-developed regulatory framework (in terms of driving times and
rest, characteristics of vehicles and loads, social protection, transport
hazardous materials, etc.), competitive pressures on the sector translate
too often by too high a number of offenses. These cause problems of
unfair competition, not only between motor carriers but also between the road and
competing modes.
Ecolo therefore calls first for tighter controls and stricter compliance
existing legislation in the transport sector in general, for a prevention
problems of effective social and environmental dumping that hit this area and for a
strengthening of initial and further training of truck drivers and small
carriers, economically more vulnerable.
The highly competitive nature of road transport and the delays incurred in the implementation
implement a kilometer tax system for commercial vehicles, have gradually
leads to over-use of this mode of transport at the expense of modes safer and more
environmentally friendly such as rail and waterways. For Ecolo, beyond measures
take to improve the competitiveness of these more sustainable modes, the main way to fight
against the road congestion is to introduce in this sector the principle of truth
costs in respect of the planned European framework for this.
Finally, Ecolo strongly opposes, for reasons of safety and impact on the modal split
transport of goods, with the same experimental use of mega-trucks, these "trains
road "of 60 tons and 25 meters long, on the public highway (as opposed to roads
"Private" or strictly autographed major ports).
Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter MOBILITY AND TRANSPORT - p 13/30 Proposal: To facilitate deliveries in urban areas
while reducing nuisance
Trade is an essential element of the vitality of towns and cities.
Historically, one can even say that it is one of their main purposes. Distribution
shops of all sizes and the presence of weekly markets in the urban fabric play
a leading role in the "logistics" of households and in the modal split of their
trips. To remain at the heart of the cities and are best supply their
residents and visitors, offering them as much as possible to appeal to the car during their
shopping, urban businesses themselves must be able to receive optimal accessibility
by delivery vehicles.
Generally believed that the transport of goods represent 8-15% of traffic
urbain16 road in the middle, which is relatively modest in terms of their socio-economic importance and some possible modal alternatives in most cases. Their impact
on traffic congestion, however, can be much more important when, in the absence
of reserved space, delivery vehicles neutralize a lane for
load or unload goods. For this reason, Ecolo believes that in this area,
inaction is not an option.
The measures to minimize transport-related nuisances and deliveries
urban goods should cover both planning and infrastructure provision
on vehicles used and the processes implemented.
Planning and infrastructure (roads, interchanges and points
delivery), it is appropriate for Ecolo, generally reserve the logistics function
spaces as necessary for its smooth integration as possible in urban mobility
broad sense and more specifically:
promote mixed use, including commercial, in neighborhoods and
location of shops of goods and services in and around the stations
subway, train stations express networks and other hubs of transport
shared, so as to minimize car use for buying patterns;
to implant in these high traffic areas frequented, collection points for
deferred delivery and removal of small colis17;
in medium-sized cities where the share of buses in traffic does not justify
Always implantation autographed bus strips, nevertheless develop such
exceptionally strips extending their access to delivery vehicles;
in the most important cities, develop distribution centers dedicated
specifically the construction industry and its reverse logistics (evacuation of
rubble), especially when the possibility of supply and removal by the
rail and / or waterways exist (Brussels, Liège, Charleroi, Namur, Mons, etc.);
to implement, in the most important commercial districts, delivery areas
proximity websites relays with or without storage space and allowing the reception and
more or less deferred distribution of packages of all kinds (business or e-commerce) and
the recovery of packaging and any unsold ("reverse logistics"), with gear
Handling adapted to the context (topography, accessibility, distances, types
goods, etc.), on the model of logistic facilities in larger centers

Concerning the optimization of the delivery process and the choice of vehicle intends Eco
support :
the procedures for coordination and consolidation of flows, by traders or
chargers themselves, to reduce the number of small shipments and transport
own account, charges generally low rate, which reflect a way of
operation based on lean but involve significant travel
to carry low volumes;
the development of delivery systems for small goods using modes
less polluting transport such as small-passenger package within formulas
transport for the delivery of some fine shops after hours

accessibility of infrastructure and rolling stock, or the use of gear type
cargo-cycle (bicycle or electric tricycle adapted to carry a maximum of 150 kg
small goods) for the last kilometers;
deliveries planning to minimize as much as possible
congestion resulting, for example, through the use of nocturnal deliveries
certain customized circumstances (distance of riverside dwellings) and subject
the use of vehicles, equipment and noise abatement procedures;
the use of the most efficient and least polluting vehicles, including when it comes
conventional delivery vehicles (noise levels, emissions ...).
It should be borne in mind that these sectors and issues
excessively diversified calling as many specific answers. For Eco, it is also
necessary, therefore, to involve all stakeholders in the development and
implementing new initiatives in this area.
PRIORITY 4: DOUBLE IN 10 YEARS MODAL SHARE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT
AND SHARE
Public transport has a key role to play in the mobility and domicileécole home to work not only as a means of travel for citizens who
are occasionally or regularly nonmotorized - whether by choice or necessity, but
also as transport "mass" only way to guarantee an offer of mobility
sufficient (in capacity) at the height of morning shuttles and late afternoon.
For Ecolo, mobility policy does not have the sole objective of ensuring
accessibility of centers of employment and avoid paralysis of the road network during business hours
advanced. The travel patterns are diverse and varied, as are the schedules, routes
and resulting needs. It is in all circumstances it is appropriate to answer at best,
focusing as much as possible the most sustainable modes. For this offering
mobility itself must be diversified and coordinated to allow maximum
people to move without owning their own car. The "railway spine dorsal"
must, as such, be complemented with an efficient basic mobility offer and affordable
urban public transport (at large), long distance and local and opportunities

It would be possible under this permit access to public transport "outfielders" and other deliverers (pharmacies,
newspaper carriers, etc.) outside of peak hours.
Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter MOBILITY AND TRANSPORT - p 15/30 84% of trips under 5 km are made by the Walloons traveled by car;
this proportion is 50% in Brussels for journeys between 2 and 5 km and 42% for
Flamands19. The potential for modal shift from car to active modes is huge for little
that is given to each mode a real place in people's mobility. That is why,
Ecolo also defends better sharing of the road and strengthening security
vulnerable road users. By mobilizing and developing all other motorized modes, public or
private, regular or on demand, collective or shared, can be doubled within 10 years their share
overall modal in motorized travel.
Proposal: Ensuring basic mobility efficient public transport
and affordable on the whole territory
In the indispensable union of alternatives for a plural mobility, partnerships
transport must first embrace, much more decisively yet
today, the role of "managers of mobility" they have been given in recent
years. Both the TEC and the SNCB STIB must provide informational integration
operational, tariff and ticketing for various methods and devices to move without
depend on his own car. In the "mobility packages" resulting from the "network
networks ", the supply of urban public transport, long distance and local, must be based on a system
hierarchical and readable, trains completing the offer and extending as naturally as possible
in the services offered by taxis and buses at the request and in the whole range of possibilities
Shared mobility offered by cars and bicycle sharing system on the one hand, and the
carpooling, on the other.
To significantly increase the modal share of public transport, the next step is to
increase the supply quantity and quality, both for capacity reasons (which
now may already default) and for reasons of attractiveness (network mesh,
frequency, amplitude hourly particularly in large urban areas, strengthening
the supply of additional school transport, etc.).
In this regard, where the bus is no longer able to ensure a sufficient solution, tram and
trolleybus (possibly hybrid) high capacity offer multiple benefits on the bus and
on the subway. Much faster and cheaper to implement an underground line
métro20, trams offer greater capacity, increased comfort and better accessibility
PRM and cyclists that the bus. And when a tram line is not possible, the
hybrid trolleybus "high level of service" 21 still offer a very decent compromise
these areas, while exhibiting the same advantages in terms of absence of direct emission
air pollutants, preferably renewable electricity consumption and
limiting noise.
For Ecolo, it is:
to put into operation as quickly tram Liege, Brussels, develop
Network trams or trolley buses, high level of service and high capacity;
to increase the commercial speed and improve the regularity and comfort
movement of public transport on congested axes, giving them more
systematically priority over car traffic by suitable amenities: websites
clean, lock the important crossroads, control traffic lights, etc. ;

21
To be attractive and competitive, surface public transport must be developed according to the maximum
standard "high level of service," which requires use in exclusive, priority crossing lights

Proposal: To facilitate and stimulate the deployment and the use of
carpooling and car sharing
For the occasional use of a car not necessarily mean buying a
privé25 vehicle Ecolo intends to create a more favorable environment for development
carpooling, car-sharing of, short-term rental car and taxi services
individual or collective (see below).
For Ecolo, it is appropriate for this:
strengthen reservation measures, motorway entrances, spaces
Parking and locations dedicated to boarding and disembarking
"Carpoolers." Once a large enough network of carpool parking

Maximum financial contribution to certain of their study activities,

encourage transport operators to collaborate more actively with
operators of car sharing and carpooling systems (dynamic) to identify and
to value all potential synergies between these different modes.
Proposal: Develop public transport demand and the use of
taxis complement the supply of public transport
The services of public transport "regular" meet schedules and routes
pre who obviously can not meet all travel needs. As to
carpooling and car sharing, their effectiveness also remains dependent on the availability of
service offering in the right place at the right time. Faced with these constraints, transport to
demand and taxis, though necessarily more expensive, offer extra flexibility that can
be valuable for non-motorized persons, disabled or isolated
especially.
For Ecolo, the bus on demand and collective taxis or individual so take a place
important in the "bouquet of mobility".
For this reason, Ecolo means:

support initiatives by TEC and local public and private partners, for
transport on demand, including socially-oriented mobility services (Commons
CPAS, associations) to the mobility of persons with disabilities, or aînés27
isolated, and the granting of taxi vouchers to supplement the supply of mobility

ensure that taxis can take the bus strips, except occasional exceptions
justified by the density of bus traffic on some of them;
promote better integration and promotion of taxis in communication and
the supply of transport services companies jointly by the development of initiatives

support business initiatives shuttles allowing them, for a
approval as taxis, to use own sites and bus stops, except
exceptions justified by an already high utilization rates;
financially and statutorily encourage taxi companies, whose vehicles
travel many kilometers per year, particularly in urban areas, to
equip vehicles that meet the most stringent environmental standards and
give priority to passenger cars in the granting of financial incentives (bonuses,
advance financing mechanisms, etc.) and operational (charging stations) to purchase
electric vehicles.

PRIORITY 5: GUARANTEE ROADS SAFER AND MORE WELCOMING TO
ALL USERS, CYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIANS INCLUDED
With about 770 deaths and 5,260 serious injuries in 2012, the number of road accident victims in
Belgium, though declining in recent years, remains far too high, both in value
absolute as compared with other Member States of the Union Européenne28. For Ecolo,
all measures must be taken to move towards the goal of zero killed on the road.
Weak users and PTW users are overrepresented
road victims. Any mobility policy must be accompanied by a substantial improvement
safety and traffic conditions of alternative modes.
Encourage the development of active modes, it is also respond to health challenges
asks the increasing inactivity in our modes of vie29. Experts recommend practicing
30 minutes of moderate activity, five days a week. Among the potential strategies for
promote regular physical activity, even in case of use of loaded time, more
effective is to develop walking and cycling for commuting.

Proposal: Prioritize the rehabilitation and effective state
adaptation of the existing network
The significant under-investment in maintenance problems since undergoing
many years the Walloon road network - and the risk of accidents associated with them - are
mainly due to the exceptional density of our roads and costs
particularly high maintenance that it entails. Rather than continue to develop this
network, which is already the most dense in Europe, there is necessary to allocate the resources available for maintenance
and modernization of the existing network and measures to encourage more use
rational thereof.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter MOBILITY AND TRANSPORT - p 19/30

Therefore Ecolo plans to develop sustainable transport modes to meet
travelers needs (e.g. rail), so as to no longer have to invest in
new heavy infrastructure dedicated to the automobile (bypasses, enlargements, tunnels,
viaducts, highway ramps, etc.). Furthermore, Ecolo proposes to favor the renovation of
existing network and a less anarchic use of it (implementation for poidslourds, of detour routes of the most problematic road sections and Introduction
a kilometer tax scheme as a means to fight against network congestion
road and fund the renovation and modernization of the network).
Concretely :
In Brussels, Ecolo opposes any extension of the ring and expressways towards
National Airport, which could only worsen the congestion in other parts of
network, while the solution to the current congestion problems should instead come from
entry into RER service and new lines of interregional tram;
In Wallonia, Ecologist considers inopportune link Cerexhe-Heuseux-Beaufays and the project
E420 motorway between South Charleroi and Charleville-Mezieres in France, including
funding would be covered only partially by the EIB. In terms
investments, these projects have indeed generated and, where appropriate,
still engender numerous expropriations and devoured hundreds
in million € would be more appropriate to invest in sustainable mobility;
Maintenance and renewal of the road network must also be an opportunity
to strengthen the security features, including the benefit of motorcyclists, and to
redesign to provide increased space for public transport and modes
assets, where proven or potential demand warrants. The way projects
development are planned, programmed, designed and implemented must adopt procedures
that ensure that the needs of the most vulnerable road users are fully taken into
account. To this end, it is particularly important to generalize the implementation of security audits
Independent road during the design and realization;
In order to catch the significant delay in Wallonia in terms of amenities
cycling, it should now focus on their realization at least 10% of average
devoted to regional roads;
Finally, it should optimize the use of existing infrastructure through the establishment
a dynamic flow management on highways: Real-time management
speed limits, traffic information, traffic lanes, etc. Such
measures are indeed capable of improving the management of existing network so
sensitive for a very low cost.

Proposal: stepping up the fight against road accidents and improve
support for victims and their families
Experiences abroad in control of speed and alcohol,
in particular, demonstrate that it is possible to further decrease the number and severity of accidents
the road to reach in a relatively short time, an interim maximum target
500 killed per year (against about 850 now), as envisaged in the States General of the
Road Safety in 2007.
In general, the policies developed in the field of road safety must better
integrate and reconcile the points of view of different categories of users concerned, which
requires the implementation of a permanent dialogue with representative associations. This
is particularly true for road professionals as truckers,
coach and bus and taxi drivers, but also with respect cyclists and
Users of motorized two-wheelers (motorcycles, mopeds, etc.), with or without sidecar, which
are more vulnerable. Insofar as the safety of these users also depends on the

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper Environmental Justice - Chapter MOBILITY AND TRANSPORT - p 20/30

quality, maintenance and special equipment (such as safety barriers adapted to
motorbikes, signaling, etc.) of the road network, which are the responsibility of the Regions and
prevention programs implemented in schools, it is important that the federated entities
regularly consult on the matter.
For Ecolo, it is also important to respect the regulations and decisions taken by
public authorities in road safety. This implies :
enhanced awareness devices and a better use of assumed
repression when necessary, particularly in the fight against the alcohol
driving and excessive speed, with special attention for blackheads and
road construction;
a more effective deterrent and prevention of recurrence, for example, by resorting more
the alcolock systematic (or "Ethylo-metric Interlock") on conviction
for drunk driving, by a more rapid increase in the level of fines for
Multi-récidive30, the speed limitation devices (not to be confused with
speed regulators) on vehicles of drivers who seem to have trouble
assess their speed, etc. ;
the integration of a component on the bike and its place in traffic in the formations
the conduct, pending a generalization to all the youth of the Patent
cyclist 5th primary;
better control of the respect of the arrangements to ensure effective sharing
public space between the various transport modes (double parking,
occupation or unintentional use of bus strips, bike paths, sidewalks, areas
delivery, pedestrian, bicycle locks, etc.).
Finally, these awareness-raising measures and incentives to compliance with the rules of the road must go
coupled with better support for road crash victims and their families, as part
prosecutions against uncivil drivers.

Proposal: To guarantee users maximum protection low
Adaptation measures of road infrastructure and targeted modifications of the Code of
route outlined above should enable to create a more favorable environment
the use and development of active modes (walking, cycling ...), in the city or in the middle
rural. In this respect, Ecolo will continue in the spirit of the "Street Code" initiated under the
1999-2003 parliamentary term, the development of measures to better share the road network
between different categories of users, notably by protecting them more resolutely
the most vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists.
These include:
enhance safety and comfort of pedestrians and cyclists by rehabilitating and
enhancing existing trails and paths, and more resolutely mobilizing the range of
road improvements and specific equipment adapted to their needs and
ensuring the continuity and the clear signs of these developments: coatings
adequate and in good condition, secure sidewalks and pedestrian crossings areas
meetings, cycle streets, paths and cycle lanes, one-way limited, advanced stop line to

PRIORITY 6: Prioritize OF TRANSPORTATION AND ENSURE SUSTAINABLE
RIGHT TO A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT
Controlling the demand for mobility in a compact organization of the territory and sharing
public space between modes, improving the attractiveness of public transport and
more sustainable freight transport and ensure the security of active modes, are all ways
to contribute to a more efficient resource mobility and environmentally friendly.
But to protect the health of residents of transport infrastructure and defend the right of
all to a healthy environment, it can also be useful to directly influence the
nuisances generated by more polluting modes, by taking measures such as
traffic limitation if necessary to meet the requirements of EU legislation and
recommendations of the World Health Organisation on air quality and
noise.

Proposal: Re-balancing taxation
Company cars alone account for 20% of cars in Belgium and about
50% of new vehicle registrations. They enjoy favorable tax regime
which represents a significant supplementary income for many workers. This
tax system encourages many companies to partially compensate part of their
staff through the provision of a car and fuel, which grows naturally
the employees concerned to favor this mode of transport at the expense of more alternatives
sustainable.
This system needs to be reviewed in order to move towards a more sustainable regime for the set
Ecoscore relation to the vehicle but also its level of consumption. This revision
should be fully compensated by other positive measures to workers
(such as lower taxes on labor) and the development of sustainable alternatives to
the company car in terms of mobility.
Pending this review, Ecolo also offers an alternative to the tax benefit of
company cars through the granting of a rechargeable card "hypermobil" matching benefits
comparable tax but giving access to a wide bouquet of more sustainable transport services.

Proposal: Promote modes, vehicles and

Give a chance to other modes, facing the truck and passenger car: this is
summarized the objective of most of the proposals made in these pages to reform mobility.
Acting on other modes however, is not enough. The current tax, for example, weighs
Moreover, in the best cases, only marginally positive impact on the choices of households and
on mobility of enterprises and equipment related to mobility. It is moreover
complex, based on various criteria and has many effects acting direction
contradictory and often perverse. The generated revenues are often used to
balance the general budget, with no particular political vision for mobility. Faced with these
findings, Ecolo offers a tax transfer to a modal shift: taxation on the modes and
most polluting vehicles should contribute to the development of transport modes
Alternative and promotion of more environmentally friendly vehicles.
Specifically, Ecolo offers:
in 2016 to replace the standard truck sticker, for a system of taxation in
kilometer, applicable throughout the Belgian road network, covering all
commercial vehicles over 3.5 tonnes and taking into account the maximum permissible weight of the
vehicle and its Euro standard, and invest additional tax revenues earned
in improving more sustainable modes of transport;
at European level, setting the average level of CO2 emissions is not exceeded,
by 2020 by automotive manufacturers, 80 g of CO2 per km for cars

reach; to also impose emission caps and more consumption
binding for light commercial vehicles, which should result in a case
as in the other by substantial fuel savings for users
since these vehicles fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are directly
proportional; to stop earlier than the emission standards to be achieved from 2025,
so as to enable manufacturers to anticipate new reductions expected;
and finally, to seriously scale back the super-credit system under which
electric car manufacturers are "rewarded" by the right to the
vehicle market much more polluting than the norm;

"Congestion charge" applied in various European cities, covering, for example,

also to fight against congestion and pollution. The revenues of this fee would

to better regulate the advertising and business practices of car manufacturers

Proposal: Minimizing pollution and air transport
encourage the use of more sustainable alternatives
Air transport makes undeniable services to society. Over longer distances,
even has advantages that no other mode of transport can offer. Despite its strengths,
there is no reason that this sector continues to be treated as if it were a public service, with
tax liens and direct and indirect subsidies it enjoys. If it is also
undeniable that air transport generates many direct and indirect jobs, many others
sectors, cleaner and high value-added social or environmental in generating
Also, which also have the advantage of being subject to the social and fiscal laws of our
country, contrary to Airmen positions of low cost airlines.
The fiscal privileges currently still benefits air transport are in part a
legacy of bygone era when commercial aviation was beginning to connect
other continents, and for another part, the result of blackmail to employment particularly
aggressive. For Ecolo, the loss of tax revenue and grants and benefits available to
sector have not only a cost to the public purse and for the taxpayers concerned, they
also generate subsidization by the community and therefore the excessive development
an activity which many negative impacts on the environment (climatic disturbances,
noise pollution, air pollution, etc.) instead justify an application more
Systematic of the polluter pays principle and a more targeted use.
Therefore Ecolo pleads including:
the gradual reduction of direct and indirect subsidies to airports and

promotional campaigns, free availability of land and buildings, etc. ;

Belgium-based staff on a contractual basis under Belgian law, thereby contributing to the
social security, like any employer.
Beyond these measures, Ecolo will defend any initiative to reduce
pollution of air transport and to ensure the right to security of airport neighbors, rest
and a healthy environment. Therefore Ecolo also calls for operational decisions
following:
a strict ban, nationally, the "flea hop" 35 involving two
offs for the same "theft";
the abolition of night flights at Brussels-National airport or implementation, to
costs of airlines operating at night, redemption or insulation program

alone reams of building "TGV freight", but also providing for
coverage of a number of major urban centers;
concerted management of Walloon and Belgian airports where possible, to exploit
better their characteristics and possible synergies while avoiding any form of
destructive competition between them.

PRIORITY 7: DEVELOP SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY POLICY
The current mobility policies still too often suffer an evaluation gap and
coordination between different levels of government and between the various stakeholders
(ministers and their administrations, public transport companies, municipalities, associations,
businesses, schools ...). Too many positive initiatives are hampered or discouraged by the fragmentation
institutional mobility policies or struggling to take off due to lack of support from the
most directly concerned authorities.

Proposal: To evaluate and coordinate the levels of mobility policies
national, regional and cross-border, involving all stakeholders
The absence of national strategic vision and coordination on cross-border mobility
is an obstacle to the adoption of coherent and effective action at the service, as sustainable mobility
that of economic development. In addition to better operational and fare integration
between operators depending on the federal state and the Belgian and neighboring regions, Ecolo wishes
for the mobility of people as commodities, the definition of a strategic vision
multimodal, coordinated nationally and integrating the main cross-cutting issues
(transportation tax) and expected contributions of the different modes of transport, including
active modes.
In this regard, Eco means:
Strengthening cooperation between federal and regional authorities as well as the consultations
inter- and intra-regional mobility on the issues, through the Conference
Inter (CIMIT) and the newly created Urban Community in and around
Brussels ;
Establish a platform for dialogue, reflection and permanent coordination between
the four public transport companies (SNCB, TEC, STIB and De Lijn), operators

quality, at affordable prices. Faced with the habits and reflexes inherited from decades of "completely
self "attract the interest of citizens and businesses for various modes of transportation
actually at their disposal does not happen by itself, far from it. This is the challenge campaign
information, awareness, promotion or experimentation highlighting
the importance of the choice of location and the various benefits of alternatives to the car
individual. But it is also an area in which citizen participation initiatives
can play a role and encourage membership and openness to change.
Therefore, in this area, Ecolo wishes:
Foster debate, modal shift experiments, field visits
informative and citizen participation initiatives at large (meetings
consultation, citizen panels, deliberative polls, etc.), which promote dialogue
open between public authorities, mobility experts and citizens ("travelers" or
residents) and allow ownership of the issues and research of the solutions
adequate by the citizens themselves;
Encourage governments, businesses, schools, major cultural institutions,
businesses of a certain size and event organizers to face
potential challenges (congestion, pollution, etc.) generated by the mobility of their staff and
their visitors and get involved in research and dissemination of the solutions
appropriate for the individuals concerned and for the community (plans
travel, organizing shuttle service, setting up carpool plants, making
provision of service bicycles, etc.);
Pay special attention to educate children about the benefits and practice of
multimodal and environmentally friendly mobility, generalizing the patent
cycling, promoting learning the rules of the road, supporting the development of
school travel plans and the organization of pedestrians ranks ("walking bus") or
framed cyclists, etc. ;
Gradually reduce the area devoted exclusively or primarily at
traffic;
Supervise commercial advertising for cars and ban advertising for cars
and products related to vehicles, at stations and stopping points transport
public;
Multiply and promote the "cycle points" and "shared bikes" devices in
agglomerations of a certain size or from the railway stations, as

to the citizens who have given up cycling for a few
years to rediscover gradually this mode of transport.

Youth, Education and Culture
CHILDHOOD
For the welfare of all children
Status and political horizon
State of play
The enfance1 and early childhood are critical moments in the construction of personality
adult becoming. Environmental quality and interactions with the environment
play a decisive role in the development of the child.
It is also a time of vulnerability and life skills require
particular approach. It is surrounded, to allow time to give a framework, security,
affection, attention, ...
Within the family, parents are obviously the first to be able to answer these
needs. However, as the saying goes, "it takes a village to raise a child." Of
Many actors, professionals, volunteers, from different sectors: nurseries, schools, associations,
health prevention places, etc.2 work daily to ensure the welfare of the
young people. The importance of their work is recognized as a social and educational point of view
economic.
With all of these actors, the objective of Ecolo is to ensure that all children's rights
recognized in the International Convention on Children's Rights (CRC) 3 and are assured
maximized. This is unfortunately not the case today.
The socioeconomic context is one of the major obstacles to the full respect of these rights. Those are
poor families who suffer the most serious consequences. Indeed, the risk rate
poverty4 is 21% in Belgium5. The precariousness affecting more and more households and Walloon
Brussels and the number of children and young people who live below the poverty line (set at 60%
median) keeps croître6.
Children are the first victims of this situation. None of the children's rights can resist
poverty :

1

The International Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) defines a child as "every human being below the age
eighteen years unless majority is attained earlier under the law applicable to the child. "
2
For more information on the proposed Ecolo these topics, see the various thematic chapters.
3
The UNCRC is a major legal tool but it should also serve as a barometer of respect for the needs and rights of each
child. Its full respect is the guarantee that everyone can live with dignity. Ecolo wants to maximize each of these
rights. The CRC allows to consider the children's rights in all their complexity and all their dimensions guarantees
fundamental to all human beings (right to life, non-discrimination, the right to dignity ...) Civil and Political Rights,
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (right to education, right to a decent standard of living, right to the highest attainable
health attainable ...), individual rights (right to live with her parents, right to benefit from
protection ..) and also rights for target audiences (right of children refugees, the right of disabled children and law
children belonging to minorities or indigenous groups).
4
For the 0-15 years bracket, the rate of risk of poverty is 18.5. In Brussels, it is estimated at 40%.
5
Within the European Union, 1 in 5 children live in households with incomes below the national threshold
poverty.
6
18% and 28% live below the poverty line, according to figures from FPS economy. Between 2007 and 2010,
percentage of children living below the poverty line increased from 10 to 12.8% according to figures from the Cooperation Organization
and Economic Development, 05.15.2013.

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CHILDHOOD - p 1/18

the right to an adequate standard of living and thus to decent living conditions: children
living in poverty have to grow up in homes too small and sometimes
unsanitary, often lack the minimal comfort and hygiene ...;
the right to family life: 15% of supported young people in need or in danger
have reasons to material difficulties and financières7. These difficulties overlie
housing problems, inadequate income, indebtedness, etc. ;
the right to health: children living in poverty suffer too often
malnutrition, have less protection against all forms of violence and abuse, and
less access to health care;
the right to education: children living in poverty often feel unwelcome at
school and face many obstacles throughout their schooling (school fees
too high cultural resources of their family and environment that do not match
those requested by the school, little access to education, citizenship and
participation, poor relationship between the school and the family, abusive orientation
to special education, future prematurely clogged ...);
the right to loisirs8 and culture (recreational, sporting, artistic and cultural)
often inaccessible when their exercise is nevertheless essential to ensure
the development of the young;
the right to participation: this right is often considered less important, so
the actual participation is also an inclusion factor;
and finally the right to home in a quality structure. In this regard, despite a context
difficult economically, the number of places created under the leadership of Minister
Ecolo childhood in the last Parliament has been almost 5 0009. New
ONE's management contract 2015-2018 provides furthermore to create 1.6 thousand per year,
6400 in 4 years. Between 2018 and 2022, the same number of seats is planned creation. In
10 years, 16 000 places are expected to be created.
The International Convention on Children's Rights is a basic text which concerns
all activities and aspects of life of children from before birth to age 18
years. The purpose of this paper is to cross and universal nature, that is to say that the rights of
the child not only to such childhood policies but all policies
can have an impact of any kind whatsoever on the child.
This horizontal approach is currently lacking in Belgium, all these policies are often
stovepipe or dependent on different power levels. For example, reduce
replacement benefits to a parent has direct consequences on the child. It should therefore
strengthen the coherence and transversality of policies to ensure that a political will
not a negative impact on the welfare of children.
"Universal" we mean that all children, whatever their nationality, origin,
culture, etc. are, above all, children and should be considered as such. The
policies in this area must therefore be aimed at children in a service logic
Universal before contact their specificity.

The political horizon Ecolo relating to children
Every child, regardless of where and how they live, should be able to grow and develop fully
and positively. Each child must be at the center of two logics: the emancipation and

Rights of the Child), in May 2013.

These rights are often seen as less of a priority as they are no less necessary than others

protection. And it is the balance between these two logics enabling each and every one of
flourish growing up.
For Ecolo, the State and the community form a barrier to social fragility and each
especially children. Therefore, the well-being of children, of all children,
without discrimination, is our political priority. The policy of childhood Federation
Wallonia-Brussels should be guided by the desire to meet and enable full
realization of children's rights. Ecolo means, in the future, pay attention
priority to the realization of the rights listed above.
Moreover, today a large number of parents wishing to seek or take up employment
see their projects hampered by the lack of childcare places for their children. The priority for
Ecolo is, therefore, to continue increasing the number of childcare places for 0-3
years to allow parents to exercise their activities, while offering children a space
socialization and friendly learning and quality.
Moreover, faced with the multiplicity of child actors, skills levels, modalities
professional interventions, Ecolo preaches the cross, a comprehensive and integrated vision of
sector so that every child is considered in its specificity, in his uniqueness. Because the
Children, regardless of their environment, their status, their culture ... are above all
children.
Apart from the educational institution, the child needs to grow and develop, to make
sport, to discover her artistic abilities, his culture and that of others, to understand the
world around. The welcome free time (ATL) is a set of associative actors or
public offering children an awakening to citizenship, academic support, a cohesive space
social. Ecolo wants to support these initiatives by making them more accessible to parents and the

support through financial means and training.
Finally, a multiplicity of family forms are observed: blended families,
single parents, same-sex, grandparentales, adoptions, procreation medically
Assisted ... The rhythms of life have also evolved and are very dense. The parenting support
is to hear the parents, to help them develop their own resources, or to supplement it
when the difficulties in taking a child into care are too great. It should in this
context of developing parenting support and educational alliance between parents and
professionals.

The main points of the Ecolo project relating to children are:
Continue the development of quality childcare places, favoring a suitable home and
nearby for children 0 to 3 years of
Ensuring the well-being of all children
Develop the free time offer Home
Support parents and support families
Improve the framework for adoption
Ensuring the well-being of children of detained persons
Protecting children in the context of asylum and migration

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CHILDHOOD - p 3/18

Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: CONTINUE CREATING QUALITY HOME PLACES IN
Favoring A HOME NEAR AND ADAPTED FOR CHILDREN FROM 0 TO 3
YEARS
A host structure is a friendly place that fosters the development and vitality
of the child. It is in its mission to promote socialization and hatching personalities. By
Moreover, the home of the child is a right, as defined in the International Convention of the Rights
of the Child, ratified by Belgium, which means that we must offer all children the same
chances at a young age, regardless of family background.
The welcome from early childhood must be considered in terms of its three main functions: social,
educational and economic. Social because it allows the construction of links between children and
discovery of the other in its difference. It is a favorite spot for discovering the world
outside, getting to know others and to be with them in respect. Educational, since
allows children to confront the early learning concepts, which will
major influence on their schooling and following their course. Finally, economic, because
it allows parents to continue to work, to take training or be looking
employment, brief reconciliation of work and family life. In this context,
parenting support is also a mission that is in addition to the traditional missions
needs to be supported (see more on this subject the priority 4).
In addition, many home études10 show that early childhood developed, inclusive and
quality corollary benefits of short, medium and long term, at the
health11, education, employment, etc. For all these reasons, Ecolo wants to continue and expand
the massive public investment in the home of early childhood.
Means were released during this legislature as part of the Plan which aims to Stork III
creation of 16,000 childcare places by 2022. Collaboration with the Regions to finance
the development and construction of buildings and subsidizing staff were implemented
through collaboration protocols in Wallonia. Collaborations have also been
up in Brussels. Despite the efforts made, the offer to host Federation Wallonia-Brussels
needs to be strengthened to meet the demand.
As for the quality and accessibility of the welcome, the sector is becoming more professional and gives more
and more attention to social and pedagogical skills of workers. In
this logic, should support existing schemes, to guarantee and ensure
recognition of professionals.

Proposal: To continue the creation of quality care places
While it is essential to pursue the creation of new childcare places to allow any
parent participation in working life and to reconcile family and professional life, intends Ecolo
also :
a balance between the rate of coverage of the various subregions;

10

See in particular the search for the University of Antwerp and KUL who recently demonstrated that each euro invested
in early childhood brought home in the end, 4.8 euros (source: "More luck in childhood," the Foundation
King Baudouin, June 2013).
11
For questions related to vaccination or to food, see Chapter "Health".

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CHILDHOOD - p 4/18

favor the creation of local structures practicing a financial participation
Parents (PFP) proportional to income and allocated based on specific needs
subregions.
In this perspective, it should work more closely with the municipalities so that they
make the reception early childhood a priority and that, organizing the different modes
Home (welcoming of children, town hall Home for Children, kindergartens ...) in
continuing support for initiatives structures and the voluntary sector, ensuring the
complementarity of supply and ensuring a coordination role initiatives12.
In this context, if the reception of children must obviously continue to be subsidized by
Community and regional bodies, municipalities should be involved more in
Construction projects. They have indeed an indispensable asset to offer hospitality
quality: proximité13. The proximity approach indeed helps improve usability,
knowledge and listening audiences, and collaboration with other
organizations. To this end, a simplification14 legislation is underway and an easing of
procedures would be beneficial.
For Ecolo, financial and human resources should be strengthened so that eventually neighborhoods
and villages have appropriate structures to host early childhood.
Finally, welcoming in-es-es subsidized home should enjoy a special status
used to manage and protect their professional situation from a social point of view
legal.

Proposal: Ensuring educational dynamics within
host environments
For the quality of reception early childhood progresses, childcare facilities must each
Therefore having an educational pilot. Ecolo proposes to generalize the profiles and skills
educational directions and teams so that this dimension is provided with the best
children.

Proposal: To meet the specific needs of parents
Atypical hours, recovery from training or employment in emergency change of pace
work of one or a self-e, illness of a child or parent, personal situation
and / or exceptional family: all these situations require specific and / or urgent home.
Ecolo certainly does not wish to increase the flexibility of the labor market but intends to respond
adequately to the current needs of parents who are faced with the difficult conciliation
between family and work or are looking for a job.
To do this, Ecolo offers:
to organize a one-time offer to host by funding drop-in centers, so
allow the occasional availability of parents seeking employment, meet
their personal aspirations, to enable them to take charge of another Member

12
The development of "Children's Houses" is an example of good practice. It is split in a
same place different services for families. This helps to pool resources, improve the mix of public,
increase partnerships and facilitate the life of families.
13
The centralization of registration (via a communal office), including for private childcare facilities, as is
foreseen in the new Flemish decree, also would streamline enrollment and make it easier for
parents.
14
The steps to take to open a reception center are from this legislature, simplified, either - by
example - to obtain authorizations or to receive various subsidies.

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CHILDHOOD - p 5/18

family or loved one. Integrated projects were set up: the "drop-in" 15 and
the "home environment" 16, to promote flexibility of the host provides and seek
perennial guards for children who have a temporary home in Drop-,.
These projects must be more fully developed. But, more particularly, it seems
necessary to make the funds more structural drop-in centers, knowing that
this home, built in conjunction with the social conditions of neighborhoods,
is a response to the needs of the most precarious families, but not only;
to build on existing structures to articulate those particular types of care
specific educational projects forming a coherent whole (both for their missions
existing for their drop-missions), with the aim of avoiding guards
strictly "economic";
finance and develop the services' care for sick children at home ";
services that allow children to be cared for at home and parents to visit
in their activities;
improve the financial sustainability of generally home environments;
to work on the inclusion of children with special needs. This includes in
access to information for all parents and especially affordable home
the most financially insecure;
to work on the training of professionnels17 and managerial standards. There
basic and further training of early childhood professionals must allow
to go to even more quality in the home and must allow points for attention
for the reception of children with special needs. However, the service early childhood
organized by the NEB must maintain a universal approach while opening the possibility to
enhanced monitoring in children's home situations with specific needs. There
involvement of parents and families should also be supported in these institutions.

PRIORITY 2: ENSURE THE WELFARE OF ALL CHILDREN
Proposal: To guarantee children's right to be recognized as
of whole persons
To be recognized as a person, it is above all about their rights and responsibilities and
means of enforcing them. It is also to ensure that those who are guarantors (adults,
institutions) provide their responsabilités18.
For that rights are respected, it is necessary that they are known, understood and practiced and
that we are primarily intended for professionals and their institutions. But this democratic principle
also prevails for children, so they can exercise their rights, defend them and do
address possible injustices.

15

The reception halt is "a flexible docking mode for children from 2 to 3 years for fixed and
develops a comprehensive approach to family with, as a priority, the flexibility of the home place. "
16
"Any natural or foreign legal family environment of the child's life that welcomes children aged
under six-boarding and regularly ".
17
In this sense, work for the overhaul of the training system is in progress. The will of achieving a trunk
joint training on early childhood home. Further, and as recommended by the General Delegate rights
of the child, it is necessary to "train workers, professionals or not, cultural codes precarious families
and relational correctness that their situation demands: acceptance of diversity, difference, recognition of
time and different speeds, capacity to recognize the possible rather than the abstract ideal, to promote the opening of
possible to measure the multiple impacts of its own requirements, etc. ".
18
According to Article 28 of the CRC on the right to education and article 29 on awareness and education on children's rights
and human rights (human rights).

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CHILDHOOD - p 6/18

Ecolo will, about this, that means be made available for:
information and training on child rights and how to enforce them, that they
are known parents, childcare professionals (and other sectors: home
foreign, government, etc.). This requires an accessible language, specifying the
scope of those rights, as part of programs to support parenting, by
initial and continuing training. All professionals, in contact with
children or dealing with topics that have an impact on children must be guided by
the principles of the International Convention on Children's Rights (CRC);
create a general climate of respect for the rights of the child, and with children
childcare professionals, with knowledge of the CRC and its ethical principles, by
the integration of its participatory principles in the host community, the school system,
etc. ;
inform and educate all children to child rights; in this regard, it is useful that the
"Training and information" coordinated and present throughout training
children and be seen not only in school but also during activities
cultural, in youth organizations, media ...;
fostering a culture of inclusion including through initial education and training
continued of childhood professionals (nurses and child care workers, teachers, etc.)
preparing them for relationships with different audiences with whom they will have to
collaborate. We must work especially how to manage diversity in the media
Home, that is to say with an offensive and pragmatic policy in this regard. The
childcare professionals need to be supported at the same time on multidisciplinarity
actors and teamwork.

Proposal: Fight against child poverty factors and
of familles19
In order to comply with Articles 3 (protection, care and well-being of the child), 18 (support to
parents) and 26 (benefit from social security) of the CRC, it is urgent to improve the situation and
access to rights of all children in poverty. This not only very
often affect their development, their health, their education and their lives
social, but it also threatens their future prospects in general.
For this, Ecolo offers include:
to ensure access to care services for early childhood, regardless of income
Parents (see above);
strengthen comprehensive policy to fight against poverty, favoring an approach
cross and considering all issues: health, employment, housing,
energy, family crisis, isolation, education ... 20;
meet the social minima for they are, as soon as possible, above the
poverty line ;
to ensure, after the transfer of family allowances to the federal entities, the good
operation of the system as we know it. Indeed,
Family allowances are not a "luxury" but a necessity supplement
for many families in a precarious situation;
to pay particular attention to monoparentales21 families, 35% are at
risk of poverty and avoid the risk of isolation of these families. This requires the

continuation of increased family allowances policy, parenting support and
support networks (crèches, schools, CPAS ...);
to continue to improve the functioning of maintenance payments service (SECAL)
public service whose mission is to intervene in case of impayées22 alimony;
to strive for the effective free compulsory education and increase solidarity
to disadvantaged students and schools that accueillent23 them;
to support professionals working in the area of ​​children, youth,
free and leisure time in the monitoring of children in poverty (making
providing tools and information on existing tools ...);
to allow all families to access near sante24 care, making
Free consultations in GPs for people on low
revenue by automatically granting OMNIO status (which guarantees free or
reimbursement of care), supporting medical homes (which allow
comprehensive medical approach, but also social and societal health) and considering
ONE psychomédicosocial consultations and monitoring of children during their school as
universal service (which guarantees a preventive medical supervision and guidance of
Children and their families);
to strengthen, in cooperation with ONE, municipalities and regional medical community,
pre-natal consultations in a number of rural communities affected by
poverty and insecurity;
to prosecute those responsible for organized begging rings who travel
guilty of human trafficking, ensuring that families are not
separated and implement prevention and support programs
begging for young beggar or parents in front of their children;
to guarantee children's rights in all subjects and areas of cooperation
Belgian development is active25.

Proposal: To fight against all forms of discrimination inflicted on
children or groups of children
Article 2 of the CRC ensures the universality of rights and invites States parties "to respect the
rights [...] and to guarantee to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination,
independently of any consideration of race, color, sex, language, religion,
political or other opinion of the child or his parents or legal representatives, of their origin
national, ethnic or social origin, property status, disability, birth or
other status ".
The State must also take "all appropriate measures to ensure that the child is
protected against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the basis of the status,
activities, expressed opinions, or beliefs of the child's parents, legal guardians,
or members of his family. "
If all children have equal rights, therefore, some children or groups of children, such as
children with disabilities, children from families of precarious, original children

In Belgium, one in four families is single and it is mostly the mother who assumes responsibility
parent.

foreign, are more exposed to various forms of discrimination. Children policies
must have a specific attention to these situations particulières26.
Ecolo intends to fight against all forms of discrimination against children. For this, it
requires:
better coordinate policies on children's rights, for Discrimination
are related to fragmented skills within different institutional levels
(education, housing, migration policy, etc.) 27 As mentioned earlier,
the child should be considered a matter of full rights, not just
as the beneficiary of various public policies. Governments must put
up cross over in their policies, focusing all
policies on the child rather than working in a fragmented perspective;
strive foster inclusive environments and schools, based on the principle that each
child with disabilities should enjoy a host project, educational and academic
individualisé28; to do this, besides the creation of additional seats should be
also support the integration logic (childcare facilities, schools, parents,
partners) and to develop collaborations between mainstream and special schools;
coordinate educational provision per academic basin for it to be adapted to
different situations and besoins29;
take into account the best interests of the child in the decisions taken in relation to
the entry, stay or return of a migrant child and / or his parents, that principle being
Today too largely absent migration policies, including Belgium.

Proposal: To limit advertising to children
Commercial advertising is primarily intended to sell and encourage the consumption of
products and services. It is often at odds with the dissemination of information
objective should clarify the choices of citizens in their consumption. Furthermore,
commercial advertising tends to break into schools, despite the explicit prohibition in
by the School Pact.
Ecolo therefore proposes to regulate advertising to children under 12 years and
make effective the advertising ban in and around schools. Ecolo finally offers
to prohibit the placement of unsuitable advertising products at events such
as fairs, festivals, fairs, etc.

PRIORITY 3: DEVELOPING THE OFFER HOME FREE TIME
The welcome free time (ATL) is the home of children outside school hours. This includes a
diverse set of educational, cultural, sports, etc. implemented either by
public authorities or by association actors, ideally in a concerted manner.
Beyond the fact that widespread access to home makes employees more time off rights
Fundamental included in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the functions it performs
are multiple, like the home of early childhood. Its main functions are social and
26

In the broader context of the fight against the abuse, see Chapter "Youth and Youth Welfare".
To this end, it would seem appropriate to hold a ministerial Conference on this subject, given the fragmentation of skills
linked. When the National Institute of Human Rights (INDH) has become a reality, Ecolo calls for the actors
responsible for the protection of children's rights are associated.

through educational facilitators: awakening and developing skills (via
games, sports, discovering the culture, etc.), creation of social ties, participation this time ...
also allows parents to take up employment, train, search
a job.
Ecolo therefore supports the development of free time to welcome each child being
given its positive effects on him and for the whole of society. Special attention
must be brought to the ATL children from precarious backgrounds.

Proposal: Strengthen collective free time home nearby
The mobilization must be collective: the common schools, through partners
cultural and sporting. The affected human and financial resources must be commensurate with
the importance of these times.
Ecolo calls for strengthening the means allocated to home leisure time nearby, and it
to :
to provide a proper status for people who provide home free time (including
grouping the benefits to different activities - school nurseries, Wednesday afternoon,
school holidays ...), so that these people get at least one work contract
halftime and could pursue a formation30 program;
ensure adequate supervision so that children are welcome in any
security ;
increase the supply of activities and better tailor opening hours and closing
of hospitality to family needs;
to make possible this reception for all families, ensuring that participation
Financial accessible and modulated according to parental means; reductions in
2nd child from the same family should become effective;
to adapt the home to children's needs: this organization requires both a
adequate supervision and the use of premises and various outdoor spaces;
in this sense, to have reception areas separated for every age can also
access to equipment and suitable time;
ensure coordination of activities organized in the same territory (activities
sports, cultural ...) and arrange travel to these activities with the aim of
achieve real equality for all children; the transition between school and work
should be organized collectively;
increase access and inclusion of children with disabilities in places
Home;
diversify and increase the modes of information to families about the possibilities
ATL.

Proposal: Strengthen educational alliances
In schools, the host are often geographically cut time and time
(premises, coaching, goals ...). At the same time, it happens that the sharing of premises
class poses problems between teachers and accueillants31.

Also the proposal of a common core training "early childhood".
Thus, on the model of "brede scholen» Netherlands, it is appropriate that new school buildings are designed,
from their design to be used for other purposes in the evening, on weekends and during school holidays: during 31

In an objective of well-being and empowerment of children, coordination and implementation
instead of places of dialogue between these actors is essential. These places of exchange and
Coordination should enable greater continuity in the day and facilitate the enfant32
information necessary to communication. It is also more generally to rethink the
school time and place of the various actors in this context.
In places such coordination, collaboration between stakeholders should be promoted. The joint
other services (support for families, strengthening social ties, support
parenting ...) must be ensured. Transversal initiatives need to be supported

Proposal: To support operators offering educational and leisure activities
quality
In order to optimize the "home free time" for children 3 to 12 years, also offers Ecolo
greater support to local partner operators: homework schools, centers
holidays, sports clubs, cultural centers, youth organizations and movements ... This requires
by increasing their capabilities, leadership training, support for initiatives
new or different. It is also necessary to ensure sufficient supply and / or a real mix
Equality in the context of these different activities (eg stating that activities
are mixed, especially when they are traditionally assigned to one sex or the other).
Resorts
In terms of holiday centers, Ecolo primarily ensure adequate funding
taking into account changes in the number of activity days and the development of initiatives
to the quality of reception: support and guidance of the organizing authorities via the NEB,
provision of teaching tools, development - in consultation with the field -
annual thematic operations ... Similarly, Ecolo offers increased support to
leadership training and holiday centers coordinators cornerstone of a
warm welcome.
playgrounds
Ecolo also proposes to develop a regional plan to support the creation of playgrounds
tailored to different stages of psychomotor development of children, enabling access
easy and to a diversity of audiences.
Physiques33 Activities
To promote the sport by children, Ecolo proposes to develop a policy of
specific support to local sports clubs and support initiatives for the discovery
of sport (sports Street, awareness ...). In this context, it is important to ensure
that the promotion of sport is not just an exclusive sports or "agora-space." The
Sport for All should be encouraged.
Culturelles34 Activities
Access to culture, the arts and the individual and collective expression in all its forms must
be supported. We must encourage and better fund operators are academies,
cultural centers, centers of expression and creativity and associations in an open environment.

social promotion, extracurricular activities, parties, etc. Similarly, the integration of communal services (library,
sports equipment ...) within schools would carry out significant economies of scale.

The issue of a rational use of space is essential both for the continuity of the welcome for
cost issues for the community, land use, etc.

PRIORITY 4: SUPPORTING PARENTS AND FAMILIES SUPPORT
Being a parent is a "trade" both wonderful, challenging and reinventing. There
diversification of family models, questioning of relationships within families,
Professional actors and social requirements complicate the understanding of this role, which remains
fundamental for the development of a child.
The importance for parents to be heard, understood, supported and sometimes accompanied is therefore
paramount when both the child itself, and for the societies in which it grows.
Supporting parents is provide information and guidance, and if desired
necessary, as soon as the project of having a child takes shape. It is also to help each parent
develop its own resources, to reassure those who do not feel comfortable to face it
new role. It's also enable parents to be faced with clear frameworks in both
Home environments, at school or in places where they can meet with their (s) child (ren).
It is finally indicate the actors or institutions that can be contacted in case of
difficulty, without taboo.
Any public initiative in this direction must ensure organize a professional, ethical and
democratic. Within this framework, educational alliance between parents and professionals
childhood and parenthood must allow the emancipation of each child.
There are now meeting places and speech. Many services can help
parents, by facilitating the exercise of their duties, accompanying them, supporting them. This is
including and above all the role of the NEB, PMS centers, educational organizations
permanent medical homes ...
In addition, support for parenthood places and moments must be recognized as time
important to put more attentive to parents and families, to learn their
needs and provide answers to their questions. Initiatives in this direction deserve
supported. The parenting support should be across the board enrolled in the missions
of all child actors.
Finally, to support children, young people and parents in difficulty, even in situations of
rupture, Ecolo wants to recreate the social and community bond. This involves valuing
own resources, the skills of each and every one, with social actors, school,
economic, cultural and network development practices, which will recreate codes
common and where co-construct life projects.
Home helps, in a revised and corrected role, can play a key role in
difficult family situations. It can be preventive but also significant in a crisis management
short or long term.

Proposal: Provide a framework Flemish Parliament support organizations to
parenthood
While everyone recognizes the importance and value in the short, medium and long term,
support parents who need it, there is currently no specific recognition
a "parenting support" and, therefore, ad hoc financial support.
Ecolo considers it necessary, after assessing projects and existing initiatives in this area,
adopt a legal framework, involving the sectors concerned. Given the services of interest
make public that these actors, a framework must ensure their structurally missions.
Meeting places between parents must be better funded and promoted. It is
Clearly answer questions or anxieties as early as possible can prevent or
avoid problems as the child grows.

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CHILD - 12/18 p

Proposal: To facilitate family time
Besides their primary physiological needs, children need stability, links,
attachment. Parents are first in line to give their child the emotional basis
necessary for their development.
The balance between family life and work allows the development of each and every one
at the personal, family and professional.
In this context, Ecolo offers include:
to guarantee the support that represents family allowances, which constitute aid
and fixed monthly parenting support;
extend paternity leave to ensure the presence of the father after the birth of
her child and allow sharing of tasks between parents;
to improve information and access to parental leave and, in parallel, to enable the
development of new forms of sharing of working time.

Proposal: Revaluate postpartum follow
The importance for parents to be heard, understood, supported and is sometimes accompanied
paramount both for the children themselves and for the societies in which it grows.
The first few weeks of a child's life are therefore essential when, in that they
influence or even determine the future development of the child. So naturally in
moment of birth, in the first weeks of life of the child, and when
becoming a parent that parenting support should start.
For Ecolo, it is important to value the postpartum follow-up, either by the medico-social workers of ONE or midwives, especially in cases of early and return home
need special monitoring. Specifically, Ecolo wishes:
diversify forms and choice of delivery within maternity homes
birth at home, so parents and wife feel best at the
birth and in the first hours of life of the child;
ensure freedom of choice for parents in the form of delivery and support
Postpartum (home, other) desired;
extend, unlike the current trend, the maternity stay for parents
wish to ensure adequate follow the first days of the child's life if
Parents feel the need, the return home is not necessarily a step
easy to manage;
enable physicians, gynecologists, midwives, physiotherapists, etc. to allow time to
their patients by strengthening the teams;
ensure access for all women to follow (physio, etc.) postpartum.

PRIORITY 5: IMPROVING THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ADOPTION
Adoption is first give a family to a child who is deprived. It is then, for a
or parents, the ability to start a family. This is often a long process and
sometimes full of pitfalls for all parties. Public authorities must
remain vigilant in terms of guarantees for the child's adoptability (avoid
child trafficking, for example) and soutenantes towards candidates for adoption.

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CHILD - 13/18 p

As in all matters concerning children and young people, it is absolutely
need to develop exchanges and cooperation between the different sectors concerned (the
Community federal and central authorities, foreign affairs, public authorities
Paid by the adoption in the country, magistrates Youth, the local authorities,
etc.). It should also establish a more structural collaboration between industry
education, early childhood (ONE) and that of adoption, and that, to ensure a
welcome and support and quality adapted to adopted children.

Proposal: Make the same internal adoption procedures
international
For Ecolo, we must base the internal adoption procedure (adoption of Belgian children) to that
on international adoption (adoption of foreign children). Indeed, at the adoption
International, Belgium amended its legislation to meet the requirements imposed by
Convention The 1993 Hague.
For ten years, the procedure required by law provides guarantees:
about the child's adoptability: prevent child trafficking by working with
central authorities recognized in the country, who control the orphanages
Belgium is working;
on the aptitude of prospective adoptive parents: the obligation of candidates to pass the
youth judge to assess their ability, obligation through an organization
approved adoption to achieve the proposed adoption.
At the adoption of internal Belgian children, federal law does not provide as many guarantees,
which is a source of legal uncertainty both for the candidates as for organizations
adoption and abandoned children.
Ecolo therefore proposed for adoption applicants pursuing an internal adoption procedure, the
implementation of a judgment of fitness before the youth court and the establishment of a
procedure for assessing legal and psychological adoptability of the child and before
all foster placement and before the delivery of the adoption by the judge.

Proposal: Accelerating the procedures in case of abandonment of the child
Adoption procedures can take time. Between the time the child is born, is
abandoned and when he is welcomed into a new family, the delays can be long. But the
first moments of a child's life are fundamental. To avoid abandonment related disorders,
it is therefore necessary to speed up the adoption procedure in case of abandonment of the child.

Proposal: Extending the adoption leave
Ecolo wishes to extend the adoption leave by tracing it on maternity leave, ie
15 weeks minimum for moment35. Indeed, the right to adoption leave current permits
not to take into account the life course, often difficult child prior to adoption.
Many breaks, extended stays in institutions, emotional deprivation, nutritional and
sensory make attachment to adoptive parents very difficult to achieve. The new ones
Parents should be especially available during the first months after the arrival of the child.

35

A proposed European directive in negotiations for several years provides for maternity leave of 18
weeks, the European Parliament has meanwhile expressed for a leave of 20 weeks.

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CHILD - 14/18 p

Proposal: Reduce the costs of the adoption process
The whole adoption process may sometimes reach very high amounts. He imports
thus to allow a tax deduction of fixed costs imposed by law and decree (costs
preparation and costs related to the signing of an agreement with an organization).

Proposal: Open debate with the help of the youth sector and
judicial authorities concerning children delayed dropout situation in aid
Youth
For Ecolo, the situation of children placed being delayed dropout situation in institution or
in foster care is problematic. Even if it is a small number of children and a solution
of last resort, after all the original family support measures have been exhausted,
simple or plenary adoption should be considered for children who need it.
So it would be for adoption professionals, assistance to youth and the judiciary,
to reflect together on the conditions and procedures for and the detection of these
situations more systematically.

PRIORITY 6: ENSURE THE WELFARE OF CHILDREN PEOPLE HELD
When speaking of the children of detained persons in question children 0-3 years
live in prison with their mother owned one hand, and children (0-18 years) parents
prisoners living outside the prison walls (in family, in foster care, in institutions
Home, etc.) on the other.
Regarding the first category, an agreement between ONE protocol, the Ministers of question
Youth, Assistance to Prisoners, Children and justice should be adopted. This protocol
agree on hosting young children with their imprisoned parent and
support for pregnant women in detention is a significant step forward for power
accommodate these children in the maximum respect for their rights.

Proposal: Ensure respect of children's rights in
prison
It will be necessary to ensure the effective implementation of this protocol, their valuation and
particularly:
ensure the establishment of a collaboration between the different actors concerned by
individual situation;
ensure the existence of adequate infrastructure for the reception of children in prisons;
ensure the creation of mother-child units in new prisons;
allow the establishment of a parenting support to parents and prisoners
mothers held;
implement training and ensuring awareness of prison officials.

Proposal: Maintaining the link between detainees parents and their children
Currently, the agreed services by the Federation Wallonia-Brussels dealing
specifically for this mission are too few. The association must be supported to

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CHILD - 15/18 p

have the means to fulfill their missions in all prisons as demands tributary.
Services of assistance to prisoners in general are also supposed to accomplish this mission,
but it is clear that it is difficult to carry out for lack of adequate means.
Because qu'Ecolo believes that maintaining the ties between parents and children is beneficial for
all parties, attention and investment is needed in this area.

PRIORITY 7: IMPROVE THE PROTECTION OF CHILDREN UNDER
ASYLUM
Ecolo wants a particulière36 protection for the most vulnerable categories of migrants
including children.

Proposal: Consider the child's interest in all
decisions on asylum and residence
The interest of the child shall be a primary consideration in all the procedures
concern, whether it be an unaccompanied foreign minor or a minor came with her
family.

Proposal: To prohibit the detention of children
In 2011, under the pretext of wanting to enshrine in law the principle of the prohibition of confinement
children, which in practice had not occurred since the condemnation of Belgium by the Court
European rights homme37, the majority made possible again the detention of
Children, inserting an article in the law which provides that the detention of families with children is
possible in a suitable center. Given the planned construction of units for detention
families around the closed center Caricole, detention of minors with their parents
back in the news.
Ecolo opposes any form of detention of families with enfants38.

HELP YOUTH AND YOUTH
Emancipatory society
Status and political horizon
State of play
Young people living in Belgium and Europe are part of an innovative and creative generation,
indignant when it is mobilized, which is at the forefront in terms of language knowledge and
technology.
The trend is to believe that, for the first time in many years, the outlook
future of the younger generation seem less optimistic than those of their parents. But of
Generally, aware of the social, economic and environmental, youth
today are not paralyzed by their future and intend to actively contribute. It is therefore
youth open to the world and its future.
At the same time, the austerity policies threaten their socio-economic inclusion:
rigor in education policies, lengthening the waiting period, high unemployment ...
For social and economic reasons, many young people see their chances of actually
reduced personal development. In an economy based on knowledge, lack of
qualification or relevant experience leads to exclusion1. In addition to prevent a gaze
Minimum positive on what we will become personally familialement, socially, this
social exclusion and économique2 complicates the overall empowerment of the young. This has impacts
on housing, on education projects, on their relationships with others, etc.
Moreover, young people are often caught between the idealized vision refers advertising
and the political and media amplification of various acts committed by young people who would know more
limits. They are however not different from other generations or other audiences. Their
difference is most of the tools offered by our time, especially in new
technological, immediacy, mobility, etc3.
This inventory can also do without the watchful eyes of adults placed on youth and
problems of violence. Yet our knowledge of juvenile delinquency remains
imperfect. First, because the police figures only measure of police activity. It is
can say whether the crime has augmenté4. By cons, we can be certain that the concern
the company in this area has increased and this concern and feeds the media discourse
1
In its 2012 report, the Higher Employment Council (SSC) recalled that "about half of job seekers
not a degree at least equivalent to that of higher secondary. The problem is even more complex than
those concerned generally accumulate other "disabilities" in terms of the labor market. Think of
young people left the education system early and do not have a recoverable professional experience [...]. "

Those under 25 account for one third of all welfare recipients in Belgium, as they were only a
quarter it was 10 years ago. In 2012, they were 47,568 to visit a CPAS to benefit from the social integration income.

"Barometer Youth Federation Wallonia-Brussels: The 12-24 years face their lives," SONECOM, June 2012.
4
By cons, we know the figures for the Youth Assistance: In 2010, 38,947 young people have been in contact with a service
of youth assistance (SAJ) or a judicial protection services (SPJ); 1588 young people have been in contact with SAJ or
SPJ, simply because they are prosecuted for an act classified as offense. That is to say that 96% of young people
contact a service of the youth assistance are because they are "children at risk". For only 4%
youth who have committed an offense. Youth Assistance, 2010 figures, statistical analysis of the Youth Assistance
in the Wallonia-Brussels Federation, in November 2011.
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HELP YOUTH AND YOUTH - 1/27 p politics. In this context, the impression that youth crime knows no answer
Institutional and that justice would be "lax" is infondée5. Similarly, and without
naively optimistic about the individual responsibilities, we must remember that 30% of decisions
taken following a referral to a juvenile court for a fact qualified infringement concern
young people who were previously the subject of a judicial decision as "children at risk".
This means that nearly a third of young people who commit crime facts were first
victims of family dysfunction, severe abuse or négligences6. They are
in priority to these young people that we must look and act, in order to provide them with living conditions
allowing them to grow. During the last Parliament, Ecolo has been guided by this vision and
has made every effort to support young people and actors who, every day, working with them.
The answers are many. Too probably. At the very least, they lack
coordination. From an institutional point of view, the fragmentation of skills and policies
for young people fail to respond in a strong and unified manner to the challenges of
the youth. An important first step for greater coordination and coherence
policy was crossed via the dynamics of the "Youth Plan" drawn up by the Minister in Ecolo
charge of youth and youth assistance. A necessary step, given the different visions
policies that confront when it comes to young people: liberating, security, economic,
etc.
The political horizon of Ecolo for Youth
When young, it is not just a "player of the future", we are already acting today.
In this sense, Ecolo has always considered young people as full citizens.
Being young, so experiment, take, create, learn. Collectively and
individually. All this is to live his actively citizenship.
In this regard, many youth associations offer the framework and tools that allow
precisely young people to emancipate and develop. Such associations must be supported
for the role they perform, both for young people and for society. It should also allow
the emergence of new associations and thematic logic. Ecolo has been and will still be the party
help these logical to emerge and consolidate.
Furthermore, in a Europe hit by the socio-economic crisis and sacrifice what seems
its most valuable, namely youth, Ecolo intends to establish conditions
the emancipation of young people so that they find their place in society: education
quality, solid training, jobs with prospects, easy access to culture, etc7.
Finally, some young people find themselves in more difficult situations than others because, for
example, social or family environment is in trouble. Again, governments have a role
major to play in supporting those who find themselves furthest from the conditions of
personal and societal well-being.
For all these reasons, Ecolo hope that the policies apply to all young
aim:
The emancipation: taking into account the actual needs of youth, especially
poor and those who are not already involved in an organization;
Autonomy: the policies should aim at what young people can express themselves,
meet, learn, move independently;
5
Please refer to the "Research related to decisions of the judges / youth courts in offenses constituting business
infringement "(NCIC, November 2012). There are only 5, 69% of decisions requesting not to take any action. It
means that 95% of cases are answered.

young people and within the general population. We must encourage diversity at all
levels (social, cultural, age, gender, disability ...).
In this context,
Ecolo the force lines for youth are:
Facilitating the transition to autonomy
Promote responsible participation and citizenship, active, critical and supportive of
young people
Improve consistency of policies affecting young
For assistance in the youth sector:
Fight against exclusion by supporting preventive policy in youth support
Ensure appropriate assistance and support to young people in trouble or in danger and their
family
Priorities and proposals for Ecolo Youth
PRIORITY 1: FACILITATE THE TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE
The crisis strongly affects the younger generation. The austerity of the Belgian and European policy
shows how it is not a solution nor a motivating horizon for everyone at
contrary. Part-time, excluding unemployment, lengthening the waiting period ... all these
actions have consequences for the welfare of everyone, has even more so for those
that start in adult life.
In addition to these political and disconnected in a socio-economic context marked by a rate
very high unemployment, young people have poor access to financial independence and
residential. Yet alongside the resources that young people can possibly find in
their family environment, various support measures exist at different levels of power.
It should nevertheless be noted that the joint support of families and public authorities
not always enough to enable every young successful transition to independence. By
Furthermore, the system is complex and characterized by a plurality of aid which are juxtaposed and that
is not always easy to grasp.
It is therefore necessary to focus, first, on simplification of the course
Administrative access to aid and, secondly, on consultation of the actors involved,
particularly young people. This is to start a global reflection on how best to
promote the transition of the young, from childhood to adulthood.
The issue of transition can not be seen as a perfectly linear path
made one clear path. The courses are more varied and are all
of essential skills development opportunities in the world today.
Proposal: To ensure access to employment and increasing skills
non-formal
By sharing the work between the generations: the "Plan Tandem" 8
To jointly meet the challenges of adapting the careers of older workers,
transmitting their experience and employability of younger workers, Ecolo
8
For more information on the proposals for Ecolo in employment and working hours, see Chapters "and Seniors
Pensions "and" Employment and Vocational Training ".
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HELP YOUTH AND YOUTH - p 3/27 offers Tandem Plan for Employment. The plan is to allow the 55 year old worker or
more (50 or older for heavier duties) to reduce their working time to
up to a half or 2 / 5th time, being replaced as part of a contract
half-time by a worker under 30. The older worker provides tutoring mission
within the company, retains its rights to pension and receives a salary equivalent to
at least 75% of its full-time salary in the case of half-time passage and at least 80% in
When switching to 3 / 5th time.
This Plan is self-funded Tandem through savings in social security seen making
Employment of a young worker and is beneficial to the employer concerned. It is managed by
Security Fund and sector Existence.
This proposal has the triple advantage to meet the needs of young people (up to the job,
hands-on learning, contacts with the "guardian" ...), the older worker (lift the foot, transmit
their knowledge, turn to other activities ...) and the company (for the transmission of experience
of its workers and assisting its younger workers).
By implementing the "youth guarantee" at Belgian
The Council of Europe is to reach agreement on "the young guarantee". This device invites
countries to put in place mechanisms that aim to ensure that a young person under 25 who falls
unemployed soon receive a job offer quality or ad hoc training. This policy
has enabled Belgium to receive significant European funding. These funds must be used
in the logic of "good jobs" defined in the employment part of the program.
Improving care for young in the world of work
Ecolo proposes to develop, within the framework of social dialogue, referents "young"
for the reception of young travailleurs9 within companies.
On the model regulation on the prevention and protection at work, Ecolo offers
to develop, within the field of social dialogue, a reflection to enroll
concerns regarding the reception of young workers and the quality of early experiences
Professional within the legislative framework of the corporate world.
It could be, at first, to prepare, in consultation with the youth sector and
world of work, a charter on welcoming young trainees, jobistes, new workers, which
would impact the corporate culture. This charter would address the societal and educational objectives
internships / student jobs and support for trainees / jobistes / young workers.
Under this charter, a reference would be appointed within the company, which will take time
generated work for both form on the pedagogical aspects of care for young
trainees / jobistes / workers to accompany itself during their internship / job.
Ongoing training is offered.
We would value priority, within the structures, skills of the people who
already undergone such training animation / coordination / teaching and that could be the
"Young referent" of the company.
The charter would encourage the mentoring of young people who were committed as part of a first
experience with the employer in question, which would promote a recovery
experience and transgenerational transmission of skills.

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HELP YOUTH AND YOUTH - p 4/27 Proposal: Reduce significantly the number of young people living in situations of
Poverty individualising social rights
Ecolo proposes deepening the individualisation of rights, including the right to at
Social integration income. This proposal aims to take account of the evolution of families,
remove current discrimination based on marital status, cohabitation or roommate, and
allow every adult to enjoy their own rights, independently of its links
private with another adult.
Indeed, when the contributions are collected individually, it does not hold true for
the granting of benefits, where the notion of households prevail in case of unemployment, allowance
disability and pensions in particular. In absolute terms, this undermines the principle of equality,
most often at the expense of women and youth.
1/3 of people affected at least once in 2012 RIS are under 25 years. It
be explained by the lengthening of the waiting period. The increase in the number of students
in this population is also of concern.
The non-individualisation of social rights, given the weakness of this income tends to
break the family or friendly solidarity, and pushes the individual to develop strategies,
depending on personal context, can sometimes raise more than the survival of the crime: black work,
fictitious domicile, etc.
Ecolo proposes the establishment of transitional arrangements allowing for the acquired situations,
individualisation of rights by landing and by age cohort, with priority for the suppression of
category "cohabiting" in the schemes of unemployment and disability benefits; alignment
General allowances and rights to the current "isolated" category. In this perspective
individualization, the gradual conversion of the marital quotient will also be considered.
Proposal: Propose housing available to students
Studies of student housing needs has been conducted by the Walloon Government
and Brussels. It appears that it is the quality and price of kots, far more than their nombre10 which,
generally speaking, a problem. Furthermore, students are sometimes clueless
their owner.
To remedy this, Ecolo offers:
Sustaining the AIS mechanism "student" and to extend it to high common
student population. This formula responds to the lack of intermediary between owners
and students guarantees quality kot affordable and stimulates the supply;
Support the creation of public housing buildings for students in
joint investment programs in which the mismatch between supply and
the demand for student housing is established;
Strengthening partnerships with universities and colleges and increasing
devices to better inform students about finding accommodation
(eg platform "Brik" in Brussels);
Support any initiative aimed at developing the student homestay in
intergenerational perspective, like for example the experience "A roof, two
ages ".

Except in Namur and Louvain-la-Neuve, where a shortage exists.
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HELP YOUTH AND YOUTH - p 5/27 Proposal: Improve the autonomy of young people in access to housing
The principle of the right of all to adequate housing (safety, security) at a reasonable price
also applies to young people. The supply of housing has a quality / price for adverse
applicants and the price of land prevents the young from accessing it.
This is to facilitate young people's independence by making access to housing as
(co) leasing or acquisition. This easy access through an increase in supply and the
development of new forms of housing (group, roommate, intergenerational).
The roommate is one of the areas of work on which it is easiest to work and must be
facilitated by a legal definition which does not penalize or prevent solidarity between the housemates via
individualized droits11.
This provision should be accompanied by incentives to enable more efficient use of
existing buildings and a communications campaign to raise awareness of the possibilities
in terms of existing habitat types "alternative": roommate, grouped habitat, habitat
intergenerational, etc.
The issues of safety and security also arise for young people, as
all insecure public. Of financial support arrangements are to be implemented to access
to decent housing.
Proposal: To facilitate and encourage the use of public transport and
active modes of transportation
Support for sustainable and appropriate youth mobility as part of their collective activities
must also be developed. The free public transport measures proposed by Ecolo
in school should be expanded to collective youth activities. In consultation
with SNCB, STIB, TEC or De Lijn, initiatives should be taken to organize a
specific mobility (special trains, special buses ...) allowing young people to go on
party venues or events jeunesse12 and back safely.
For Ecolo, we must also encourage awareness and road safety modules based
a holistic and social approach of the pipe (technical aspects of driving, control of
vehicle, health hazards, road accidents, the overall cost of the car ...). Preventive work
associations on youth outings places must also be supported.
In parallel, it should develop the public transport network or group night (at the same
rate as of day) in order to grant everyone the right to responsible mobility.
Ecolo also proposes to grant to each youth, on the occasion of his sixteenth birthday, libreparcours a year on the entire transport network in Belgian public and to allow
access to mobility for all on the one hand and attempting, on the other hand, change patterns
Traditional mental "all in the car." A similar initiative should be developed

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HELP YOUTH AND YOUTH - 6/27 p Besides the emotional aspects, the notions of sharing and fun that should occupy a place
important in these modules, they must integrate and psycho-biological dimension.
Even today, too many young people find themselves in complex situations or take
risks to their physical and mental health because the information is fragmented,
incomplete. It is essential that young people easily get answers to their questions
on puberty, contraception, sexually transmitted diseases. These moments are
the opportunity to tackle teenage pregnancy and their effects, gender and reports
gender, sexual identity and orientation, sexual mutilation, STDs and AIDS,
violence, pornography ...
This approach should be integrated in the mandatory school curriculum because it allows
including conducting an indispensable work in terms of prevention. The emotional and sexual life
is primarily a source of pleasure, happiness, sharing, but more when you can
make choices knowingly. Information and education are essential.
Proposal: Supporting young people in access to international mobility
During their studies and après14
Youth mobility as part of their studies or outside, is an experience
rewarding and unparalleled opening to the world. Ecolo intends to make this mobility
accessible to everyone, whatever the economic, social or family of the young.
It is therefore necessary to maintain and enhance, at European and international level, means
for non-formal education and the programs that primarily target young people more
precarious. Emphasis should also be placed on the access of young people to the various programs
and their support through the International Youth Bureau, organizations
Youth, youth centers, etc.
Proposal: To facilitate youth access to culture
Young people are actors, creators and consumers of crops. These are source
communication and identity. For Ecolo, we must promote an open society that arouses
creativity and imagination, where everyone will have the opportunity and the means to express themselves.
For this, it is necessary to:
Strengthen and sustain innovative community initiatives, systemic, transversal and
proximity, allowing to provide a reception quality and adapted to public
young people ;
Provide support to enable the effective implementation and quality of projects
returned by collective of young "distant" approved associative realities;
Assess the cultural-school program to make it cross in a
Enhanced dynamic partnership between actors from school and culture and in a
concern for quality of selected projects from the perspective of partners;
Finance the association "Article 27" in order to expand social partnerships with youth associations;
Encourage operators to develop arts and cultural programming that
meet local realities and value diversity. In recent years,
initiatives to involve the public works have been deployed: shows
mixing amateur and professional entertainment district, created by and with houses
young, featuring disabled, etc. This is to support artists
and associations that advocate for diversity on stage and help to reconcile ambition

PRIORITY 2: PROMOTE RESPONSIBLE PARTICIPATION AND CITIZENSHIP,
ACTIVE CRITICAL AND UNITED YOUNG
Citizenship is a major political issue. Considered in the complexity of "living together"
it inevitably refers to the need for a well-functioning society, reflect
the opinion and creativity. Consider everyone, including young people, as actors.
Citizenship is learned through practical exercise. Therefore Ecolo intends to support
youth participation at all levels and their involvement in all matters the
concern.
This necessarily implies strengthening political participation and supporting actors
associations that make citizenship and participation of young people at the heart of their mission.
Proposal: To support the participation at the heart of the youth sector
Youth organizations and youth centers are actors of great importance
in the lives of youth. These approved associations but also an impressive number of other
sports associations, cultural, supportive, festive ... enable young people to be both
beneficiaries, actors and builders of the action, this relationship between peers and with adults.

These approaches and learning places worth in the eyes of Ecolo, a voluntary public support,
which should help:
better visibility of actors who commit daily to youth and to
clarification of their place in the institutional field of youth work. Indeed, the
work of these many organizations is often too little visibilisé, while everyone
world recognizes the importance;
increased support for the development of sectors;
a consolidation of budgets to accredited youth associations in
response to the ambitions set on them;
to label the places available camps, making available public land,
strengthen and support the work of dialogue with youth movements
their needs and expectations and respond to them;
the gradual emergence of a common working culture that reflects the values
and methods in the sectors concerned, from the shared ambition to forge
responsible citizens, active, critical and solidarity (the "CRACs") - while
convinced that the vision of work "youth", citizenship and participation are
not univocal.
In this context, Ecolo proposes in particular to:
Increase the volume of permanent employment of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation for
association projects "youth", ensuring their financing by the WallonieBruxelles Federation and / or Regions;
Enhancing coherence between regional employment arrangements and sectoral policies
Youth to ensure transparency in the granting of these regional stations as well

Furthermore, it should encourage better coordination between youth policies at
local and at the Wallonia-Brussels. To this end, Ecolo offers:
Consider, with the associative actors, best practices to strengthen
local youth policies, to strengthen the identity and legibility;
Strengthen the territorial coverage of youth centers, local movements

Clarify the roles of the Regions and the Federation Wallonia-Brussels in politics

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HELP YOUTH AND YOUTH - p 9/27 Proposal: To support new modes of engagement and organization
young people
New types of organizations, driven by young, emerging around the new
solidarity, to alternatives to the traditional political pattern, sustainable development,
protection of the environment, of what citizenship today of renewed occupation
public space, soft mobility ... Through these associations, innovative projects and
original, convivial experiences are raised.
Ecolo intends to support these new forms of youth engagement by improving their visibility,
valuing existing experiences and ensuring adequate and sustainable funding of these
initiatives, in a logic of complementarity with the existing associations.
Ecolo therefore proposes:
Strengthen the resources allocated to policies that target youth, both in
cultural policies in social cohesion, for the realization of joint projects and
solidarity ;
To the day of 12 August, International Youth Day, an opportunity to make visible
all youth initiatives in partnership with the media.
Proposal: Promote participation everywhere and for tou-te-s
Consider credible policies for children and young people involves well
connaître16 and therefore actually taking into account their views or issues they
pose. Similarly, these policies should take into account a detailed picture of
multiple dimensions that covers the reality of youth. Opportunities to participate actively
the processes of decision-making must be created, consolidated and multiplied. This applies in
example of participation and the consideration of the claims of young people, as part
International climate negotiations or UN.
Many places of interest already exist: youth associations, local councils
young people or children, participation in schools, in fact associations, etc. Ecolo wishes to continue
to support pluralism and wealth of what young people are setting up their contribution being
essential in building a responsible and caring society.
The areas of youth organizations and accredited youth centers are obviously
key players to carry out these policies. The association is run by youth
and for young people. These associations are collective spaces for experimentation, discovery,
emancipation, of living together and daily participation.
Finally, Ecolo, it is important to remember that young people have the right to entertain,
to party, to play sports, attend cultural events ... for their sake. he
Youth must remain a period of discovery, learning, trial and error.
16
Therefore, it is important to have a true "photograph" of young people, their situations, their strengths,
their weaknesses, brakes they meet, their expectations, their desires, their hopes and fears. On the side
French, there is a quality scientific work on prevention, youth welfare, etc. However, few networks
researchers are supported to work specifically on youth. There is political work to carry over
to support research, especially from a perspective that allows to provide the academic world referents
to address youth related citizenship issues. We also mentioned the important work of the Observatory
Children, Youth and Youth Assistance (OEJAJ).
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HELP YOUTH AND YOUTH - p 10/27 Proposal: Promote the participation of young people from neighborhoods
disadvantaged
In general, it is shown that the introduction of policies would be better accepted if it
scope and was built collectively with the different components of the population covered
by these policies. It's the same with disadvantaged young people from a socioeconomic perspective, but also young people from immigrant families who attend less often
classic places of citizen participation: youth organizations, youth centers,
civic associations, political parties, etc.
Ignorance of existing participatory structures is one of the main obstacles
preventing youth participation. Consideration should be given, with field workers, the
how best to organize the work of information and facilitation, specifically to the attention
young people from low socioeconomic backgrounds.
For Ecolo, in addition to ensure decent living conditions, which influence the
participation of young people, should evaluate existing practices here and abroad who
consist of comparing the precarious public of public decision and equip stakeholders
social in this perspective.
Proposal: Strengthen and structure the consultation places
The Youth Council
The Youth Council has had new statutory amendments to enter into the
conditions of membership in the European Youth Forum. It will be necessary to evaluate the implementation of
these changes to enhance its durability and its means of action and enable it to
sensitize more and more young people, whatever be the medium from which they come, their
commitments, or location. The Council must be supported in its ability to collect
word of all youth and its role as "itching powder" of politique17 world.
Local Councils and Advisory Boards
Local Youth Councils or children, youth advisory councils, etc.,
enable more youth to participate in the life of their town, are often set up and
structured through (good) will of local politicians. Ecolo believes they should be extended to
all levels of government and that this development should definitely benefit from a framework
common democratic and legal educational tagging what should or should not be a Council
view youth representative and effective. This legal framework should enable production results
concrete and taking account of advice from those whose advice should be an associative youth
pillar.
Local referendums
Popular local consultation regarding the inhabitants of a town aged 16
made. They can organize and / or participate. This is already possible and held in
Wallonia, the municipal and provincial levels, as well as Brussels-Capital Region. 6th
State reform also makes possible the regional and Community
German, for regional matters, the exercise has been transferred to him. These terms
organization must also allow the participation of more than 16 years and the
popular initiative consultations. For the future, we hope that this possibility is
also extended, with the necessary modifications, to the federal level.
17
It would also be advisable to consider the installation of a "European Youth House" would be a place of
gathering of various participatory youth councils (CCOJ, CCMCJ, CJ ...). This house is expected to
better synergies between different participatory councils and improve the visibility of these and enable them
to have a clean place to them.
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HELP YOUTH AND YOUTH - p 11/27 Proposal: Provide education and critical media access
For Ecolo, the youth information policy through measures promoting their access
media, as well as training in the use and critical analysis thereof. Education
médias18 to, as awareness of the most critical use of new technologies,
must be able to be part of academic learning and be organized and supported in the
associative field. In the same context, the role of the RTBF educational media should
also be strengthened, including the integration of young people in general programs on
all matters concernent19 them.
More generally, the sustainability barometer of diversity in the youth angle should guarantee
a balanced place of youth in the media (broadcast and print).
Proposal: To limit advertising aimed at young people
Commercial advertising is primarily intended to sell and encourage the consumption of
products and services. It is often at odds with the dissemination of information
objective should clarify the choices of citizens in their consumption. Young people are at
Like their parents, increasingly subject to advertising manipulations.
Therefore Ecolo means:
Regulate commercial advertising, in particular to restrict certain advertisements
particularly violent, degrading, sexist or misleading;
Strengthening media literacy and learning critical reading of these messages
publicitaires20;
Regulate advertising to children under 12 years and make effective
the advertising ban in and around schools;
Prohibit the placement of unsuitable advertising products at various events
types of fairs, festivals, living room, etc.
Proposal: Lowering the voting age to 16 and raise youth awareness
political issues
Ecolo considers it essential to prepare young people to exercise their responsibilities without bias and
objectively, which is not always the case. Awareness devices in
formal education as there are places in the non-formal education should be
developed, widespread and institutionalized.
Indeed, specific times dedicated to the approach of citizenship to
understand the institutional organization of society, as the rights and duties that manage
our relationship to each other, must be proposed within the framework of the teaching obligatoire21. With
the help of external partners in education at school and on the basis of attractive and educational tools
appropriate synthetic training time addressing the "why and how to vote," the
concept of general interest and "what is the social security system, which finance, what are taxes" will
be offered to young people at different times in their school career.
Confident in the ability of young people to understand the political, to hold high ideals and
to be aware of their role as citizens actors in society, Ecolo proposes to lower the right
vote in 16 years. Given the aging population and the increasing responsibility that goes

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Youth, Education and Culture - Chapter HELP YOUTH AND YOUTH - 12/27 p lie to younger generations associate the policies that have a direct impact on their
their present and future is essential.
In true democratic concern and in view of the emergence of laws more draconian that
target young audiences (municipal administrative sanctions from 14 years22, for example), Ecolo
considers that they have a right to be truly part in the debate.
At European level, the abstention rate of 18-24 year olds in the European elections is the highest
of all age categories. Ecolo intends to support the Youth Forum and the Youth League
voters to strengthen information work and youth outreach. In this sense,
lowering the age of voting could lead younger people to be concerned about
these elections.
Finally, exercise their rights as citizens and develop a critical approach to the world and
institutions involved to have available a suitable and quality information on what it
play. Having access to information, with a critical spirit, solidarity and responsibility, that
necessary conditions for the exercise of democracy by and for young people.
To this end, Ecolo intends to conduct, with the incumbents of information to young people, a
reflection on how to inform young people today, and that the aim of ensuring
quality information adapted to new realities (NTIC ...), as part of the transition
ecological and sustainable development.
Proposal: To provide a framework for international volunteering
Under cover of foundation or association "humanitarian", commercial enterprises offer
(sometimes at exorbitant prices) "humanitarian" trips. These corporations operate
the good faith of young people who wish to leave as volunteers and use practices
disputed that seriously harm both the international voluntary sector, as
people who welcome locally and youth themselves.
For Ecolo, it is necessary to clarify the objectives of each and to ensure recognition
Real volunteering - that is to say, that has no profit and the organization meets the requirements
training of CRACs. This recognition and this control must coordinate at
European.
In addition, it is currently impossible for a volunteer outside the European Union to obtain a visa
to come to Belgium, it must go through an application for a temporary work permit. Ecolo
wants an exemption is provided for volunteers.
Proposal: To foster the emergence of new democratic skills
Citizen participation implies the existence of spaces and places in which people can
give their opinions and be heard in the decision making processes that affect them. Beyond this institutional dimension, an exercise in civic participation request
also mobilize essential skills: ensuring plurality of views,
ensure everyone listening, promoting adherence to collective decisions, etc. These
backgrounds are engaged in the longstanding work of youth associations
contribute on a daily basis to the development of citizenship skills among young people
generations.
Ecolo intends to support the development of cross-training offer, aimed at
actors in formal and non-formal education on the use of new methods of
governance, participation and management group projects, from the expertise developed
by youth associations.

For more information on the proposed Ecolo on this, see chapter "Justice and Prisons."
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HELP YOUTH AND YOUTH - p 13/27 Proposal: Organize with young people the right to party
Ecolo proposes to implement a right to party for young people, ensuring dialogue locally
between public authorities and representatives of youth and respect for each
components of the local community. Through this initiative, these include ensuring the
positive reception conditions, safety and health in places of youth festivals: home
everyone, existence of rest areas, free access to drinking water, preventive policy
in road safety, alcohol and drugs ...
If alcohol is associated with celebration and conviviality, the fact remains that it must arouse
reflection of young people about the use made of it, informing them of the risks in the short, medium and long
terms of excessive consumption, but also the awareness with the practical
Commercial manufacturers of alcohol, limiting the overvaluation of alcohol in our society or
by prohibiting sales to under 16 drinks in which the presence of alcohol is
masked (alcopops and beer "light").
To these are added the dimensions aspects relating to mobility and non-use of the car under
influence of alcohol or drugs, educating drivers and passengers to the risks.
Finally, it should encourage the middle of the party in respect of each. The "middle of the
night "(catering Cultural places ...) should not automatically be considered as a vector
nuisances (noise, drinking ...), especially by public authorities, but as
an actor promoting employment, friendliness, economic development and tourism and
can actively contribute to the party in a secure environment for young people.
PRIORITY 3: IMPROVE THE CONSISTENCY OF POLICIES CONCERNING THE
YOUNG PEOPLE
Proposal: Sustaining Interministerial Conference Youth
Ecolo wants the "Interministerial Conference Youth" 23 (CIM) set up by the
Minister of Youth Ecolo in the 2009-2014 term is largely invested in the next
governments to ensure a real transversale24 policy for the younger generations. Ecolo
CIM hopes that this is also extended to other levels of government (federal and regional)
in order to have all possible levers to advance the political priorities for the
young people. It is from there that a real strategy can be born and transcend institutions and
levels of power, with a strong vision for the future generations.
Proposal: Incorporate the "young" point of view in each law, decree or
order
The measures affecting young people in their daily lives is not limited to policy
youth, education or culture. Some economic measures, development of
territory, or employment, to name but these examples may greatly affect
living conditions of young people. In a sustainable approach to public policy, it is important
that governments of every level can anticipate the effects on youth and
children, they adopt new regulations, similar to what is already being done in Flanders
("Kind- in Jongere-effectrapport: Joker").
23
This ministerial conference is to be guaranteed by the Minister-President with a view to having all levers
to make youth a priority.
24
The desired cross here should, however, ensure that the identities of each sector are preserved.
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HELP YOUTH AND YOUTH - p 14/27 Ecolo hopes that the establishment of such a procedure is embodied in policies
French, reflecting the will to make youth a priority. This monitoring will need
also highlight the impacts on the socio-economically disadvantaged youth and the risks
discrimination between girls and boys.
Proposal: Realising the territorial coordination of initiatives in favor of
young people
It is thus to support and structure of alliances between partners involved in
Equity Shares, reception and support for young people in the territory of one or
towns. The goal is pragmatic: it is an update on initiatives
existing in a territory, to identify ways of better cooperation, for the benefit of all
youth and their families and in line with freedom of association. This is part of
elsewhere in the logic of educational alliances proposed by Ecolo around the school.
The support for cultural projects, sports, school, educational, associative, participatory, to
local youth councils, youth assistance measures, health promotion or
organization of public space, the use of infrastructure and communal mobility plans
will be the work of these local coordination of youth.
Proposal: Support structurally youth projects decompartmentalise
sectors
While each sector specificities and different objectives, it is important that actors
Course work together and, therefore, that the political world gives access to tools
common. For example, projects "Interculturality" aim to enable
workers of the Youth sectors and the Youth Assistance, facing the challenges of
interculturalism, can engage in a work practice reflection, through a
supervision or individual and / or group training, and develop concrete projects
around this theme.
This kind of call transversal projects must be consolidated and expanded to other areas. he
However, should ensure that this type of project allows decompartmentalize long
term and the operation "per project" nevertheless allow the development of these missions
structurally.
Collaboration between AMO, youth centers and youth organizations must also become
structural. In large cities, especially in Brussels where the actors who work with
Youth are French or Flemish, it is essential to develop synergies between these
different structures, and regardless the language rules which they belong.
In the Brussels Region, Ecolo supports and wants to sustain the action of "Het Werkt platform!
It works ! "(HWCM) which brings together youth workers from both communities. There
youth participation in regional policies must be strengthened and more cooperation
great between actors, for the benefit of all young people of Brussels, regardless of their language, must
be established.
To do this, we want to structurally reinforce these collaborations that already exist
today and opening up of sectors to sustain these projects.

PREVENTIVE HELP YOUTH
The youth aid sector is the receptacle of situations of discrimination or exclusion
their source upstream in school problems, family, economic, of
training or employment, housing, etc., problems that can be solved only by
aid actors to youth.
The decree of March 4, 1991 as amended in 2012 affirms the principle of priority to prevention.
Today, the resources allocated to the latter does not suffice to meet the problems experienced by
youth and their families. Ecolo wants to continue to invest in a coherent preventive politics,
Nearby, with players in the field of youth welfare and in synergy with other
sectors: education, childhood, youth, culture, sport, etc. Preventive policy must
aims to address the causes of exclusion and must therefore consider
policies affecting young people across the board.

Proposal: To ensure every young access to support services in an open environment
(AMO)
Established in the heart of neighborhoods, AMO are often the first contact between a young,
family, school and youth welfare. Ecolo wants to concretely support these actors

improving the coverage of AMO by creating services or approval of antennas
in areas not covered;

Professional;

Proposal: Allow access to school-hooking Services (SAS)
School-hooking Services were created to improve access to each young
schooling or training through an individualized labor mobilization of the youth. There
current geographic coverage of SAS does not guarantee that access for all young people
Francophones.
Ecolo wants to increase the number of SAS in the territory of the Federation Wallonia-Brussels
approving the appointment of a service catchment area.
Proposal: Strengthen prevention General Youth Assistance
The amendment, in 2012, the Decree of 4 March 1991 on assistance to youth in 2012 induced
a major reform of general prevention. The reform reorganizes and streamlines tasks
rounding Aid Tips for Youth.
Ecolo heard implement this reform through the following actions:
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HELP YOUTH AND YOUTH - p 16/27 Granting more resources (human, methodological support) for the development of
social diagnosis and the implementation of action plans Borough councils
the youth assistance (CAAJ);
50% increase in budget allocations to the general prevention measures;
Supporting the establishment of platforms for dialogue between youth welfare and
CPAS throughout each district;
Continue the development of educational alliances structuring work with other
sectors of the Federation Wallonia-Brussels, drawing on measures already taken
(Teaching, CPAS, ONE, etc.);
Allowing presidents of CAAJ to get more available by the grant,
benefit of the service which it is derived, a grant equivalent to 20% of its cost
wage.
Proposal: Guarantee the participation of youth and their families in decisions
concerning
Young people and families affected by the youth assistance must, and without exception, be
closely involved in decisions that affect them. They must also receive assistance
adequate in their mid vie25. The aim of our proposals is to aim the full autonomy
families, to this end, it is necessary to:
Extend the intensive intervention with family for very young children in difficulty, to
support their parents and allow in some cases, to avoid the child's placement;
Ensuring transparency of decisions taken by the youth welfare services (SAJ) and
judicial protection services (SPJ) as well as all writings which concern
these families directly;
Ensuring the inclusion of the word youth and families (both in
individual and collective);
Supporting families through conflict separations to avoid aggravation,
even litigious situations, developing the "parents in the spaces
separation ", in partnership with the Federal. These spaces are used to guide without
stress parents who are not spontaneously seekers to a service
will raise awareness about the benefit for their children-s-s, to collaborate in an effort
the restoration of parental cooperation;
Working in maintaining the child's relationship with his parents, in case of placement of it
in foster care or in institutions;
Support projects to promote good treatment and support to parenthood in
especially for underage mothers.
Proposal: Strengthen civic years
Ecolo believes that citizenship must also be integrated into preventive actions in question
Youth. The experimental project "citizen years" are to allow a
youth group, supervised by an AMO service to conduct during a full school year, a
program of civic activities and thereby positive experiences that allow them to
To end a trail of failures or ruptures and get back into a personal project. These
young people are mostly aged 16-18 years and school leavers.

For more information about our proposals on support for parenting in general, see Chapter
" Childhood ".
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HELP YOUTH AND YOUTH - p 17/27 The evaluation of these projects has demonstrated the relevance of their sustainability. This has been achieved in
the 2009-2014 parliamentary term to the initiative of the Minister Ecolo. In the future, it is necessary to amplify these
by developing projects throughout the Federation Wallonia-Brussels, ensuring
evaluation and strengthening their means.
PRIORITY 5: ASSISTANCE AND ENSURE ADEQUATE SUPPORT FOR YOUTH
DIFFICULTIES OR AT RISK AND THEIR FAMILIES
The situations supported by the youth assistance today and the suffering of young
ask the company in its operation and the problems it generates. There
complexity of these situations requires a systemic approach.
Counselors, directors of Youth Assistance and Youth Magistrates regularly attracts
the attention of policy makers and public opinion on the excessive number of young
for which a decision was made but can not be executed in the proper service, as
it is a service of the youth assistance, a medical-educational institute, a psychiatric hospital,
a nursery, a host family. The youth support services regularly relay the
situations of the families of the young people entrusted to them and are often extremely
degraded. This has the effect of increasing the time to support or
accompanying the young, and therefore reduce the possibility to provide new
supported.
Besides the absolute need for stronger preventive policy to fight against the
factors of exclusion faced by young people and families (cfr. Priority 4), it would
unreasonable to disregard the finding of waterlogging services that are unable to ensure,
with the means that are theirs, a prompt management of dangerous situations.
In addition, adequate resources to support children and young people at risk
are very unevenly distributed in the territory of the Federation Wallonia-Brussels.
Finally, young people are faced with very different sectors and actors. These must
improve cooperation to prevent young people and families are tossed a service
to another or from one sector to another. In recent years, collaborative protocols (with
CPAS, the disability sector, ONE, teaching ...) have increased consistency
interventions in these sectors and operationalize the complementary and
residual of the intervention of the youth welfare sector. It should continue and support
these dynamic intersectoral cooperation and to ensure that all of these protocols
are effectively implemented on the ground.
Proposal: To adopt a multiannual plan for refinancing utilities
and approved of the youth assistance
Within some SAJ and SPJ, delegates are in charge of too many situations
to ensure regular monitoring of the young people concerned.
Moreover, timely supported by the agreed services of the youth welfare are too
long and too many children or young people at risk can receive the necessary support tailored to their
situation.
The building plans implemented in recent years have created 650 taken
additional load. However, this represents less than 7% of the current capacity of the sector.
This movement must be supported and amplified in the next legislature, to aim for a
target of 20% increase by the year 2022. This increase in intake capacity
Charging must be accompanied by a workforce adjustment of public services and resources
granted to authorized services. It is also appropriate to provide for operating costs and
management fees greeted young, to be collected by the authorized service.
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HELP YOUTH AND YOUTH - p 18/27 Proposal: Having the analysis and management of the aid sector tools
Youth to improve the system for the benefit of young people
In recent years, the youth assistance sector has significantly improved its analyzes
sector, with, among others, the objectification of socioeconomic characteristics
arrondissements, characterization of young people in care, and analysis of the activity of the sector
assistance to youth. These analyzes have been published in various publications and reports
activities.
They showed very different realities from one borough to another that result
by different practices, both in terms of referrals to primary care services in
regarding decisions of constituents.
For Ecolo, it is first necessary to make professionals control their mains
choice. Thus, sector programming and capacity management capabilities
must be based on a needs analysis based on the population, conditions
socio-economic and geographical accessibility.
Furthermore, the priority of youth care should be decided by the counselors, directors
and Youth Magistrates, more than by order of registration on a waiting list.
To do this, Ecolo proposes to provide the sector with the youth of a real system
information, software tools and analysis that allow a better understanding of
sectoral activity and that will drive the best sector for the benefit of young people.
In this context, drawing on the strengthening of the management capacity operated during
the 2009-2014 parliamentary term, it should strengthen management capacity in
boroughs, analysis, appear in programming delay with respect to other
boroughs.
Proposal: To ensure the young person and his family continuity and consistency
in the support
Ecolo see today, with part of the industry, the consistency and continuity of decision
support is not assured. Indeed, a service that hosts a troubled youth does not receive
Always the information and assistance services that have taken this same young charge previously.
It is the young who suffers.
The continuity and consistency must be strengthened through collaboration between workers
social services and with different families.
The reform of District Councils (CAAJ), is one of the elements for a
therefore better dialogue and better collaboration among services sector.
It should also:
Strengthen the training of the directions of the agreed services to encourage teams
work in this direction;
Improve the dialogue and collaboration between authorized constituents and services;
Confirmed the halt to the extreme specialization of different types of service
assistance to youth.
Proposal: To support foster families and develop foster care
In Wallonia-Brussels, 7500 children are hosted elsewhere than their parents
as part of a supported by Aid to the youth sector. Of these, about 3400
youth living in foster care. These are about 2400 families who today welcome a
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HELP YOUTH AND YOUTH - 19/27 per child. And demand for care in foster care is increasing every year,
while the number of volunteer host families remains insufficient.
It is therefore necessary to increase and improve the offering in foster care. This goes through :
The promotion and development of this type of home;
Support families to make their lives easier when they are available to help a child.
Thus, like parental leave, adoption leave must be accessible to all
host families who want it. In addition, the financial management system
family benefits should be simplified;
Recovery, support and development of sponsorship. It is to accommodate
ad hoc but regularly a child, to bring him resources
soutenantes for news and developments.
Like the host families, the lack of "sponsors" for FWB. But sponsorship can come
assist parents who, at some point in their lives, struggling. This type of reception
family also enables us to offer a child living in an institution the chance to find a family,
time for a weekend or during school holidays.
Proposal: To fight against child abuse
The need to intervene at the earliest in situations of neglect and abuse is
undeniable. Emphasis must be placed both on prevention and on the articulation of interventions,
when it comes to properly take care of an abusive situation.
Ecolo considers that:
Workers and field workers (sports instructors, teachers, educators
schools and boarding schools, nursing ONE, youth movement leaders ...) must
be trained and informed to accommodate every young but also be
able to identify the signs of risk or symptoms of abuse. Their
Training should allow to easily activate the network mobilized, when
faced with an abusive situation;
Action must be conducted to make known to the general public and children,
prevention services and assistance to child victims of abuse and to facilitate access to
these services;
The service Children Hear the 103 free and anonymous, for children facing
a difficulty but also to adult children in situations of difficulty or
danger, should be better known;
The articulation between the actors that support situations of abuse must
be strengthened, including through local commissions for aid coordination
child victims of abuse;
The intensive intervention to families of very young children, allowing in
some cases to avoid the placement should be extended.
An intersectoral collaboration protocol was concluded in 2013 and the first action plan resulting from
this protocol should be adopted in 2014. It should support and strengthen this dynamic
involving all sectors of the Federation Wallonia-Brussels and all actors
first line (teachers, sports instructors ...).
Proposal: Fight against investment measures because of poverty
The youth assistance sector is regularly confronted with placement of a child or
Young because of precarious financial situation of the parents. An intolerable situation
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HELP YOUTH AND YOUTH - p 20/27 called coordination of policies and drastic measures to ensure that each
sufficient existence conditions. It does not in fact return to the youth assistance to alleviate the
lack of income to live decently. These are employment measurements,
social security, welfare, logement26 ... that must accompany these families to avoid
painful separations and enable these children to continue to live in their
family environment.
Proposal: Continue implementation of the cooperation protocol between
assistance for youth and CPAS
This protocol tag the roles of the youth assistance (SAJ and SPJ) and CPAS and
methods of cooperation for the benefit of young people in difficulty and their families. It allows to
take into account the ground realities of each judicial district.
Ecolo means:
Supporting regular meetings between stakeholders from both sectors within the
of platforms within CAAJ;
Implement joint training to improve knowledge of
Social workers from both sectors to bring the protocol into practice.
Proposal: Improve the link between education and youth assistance
Far too many young people face access to education difficulties or are not
School meets their aspirations. The numbers of school drop-out and exclusion are
far too high. Moreover, young people are faced with a multitude of stakeholders in
school and out of school, which can offer them guidance or support. Double
service offer related jobs are real actors in these dependent regions
or the Federation Wallonia-Brussels. Young people are the first victims of these confusions
Roles.
Ecolo wants to clarify this situation, both by improving the coherence and visibility of institutions
serving youth and their families and strengthening collaborations between professionals.
The goal is to substantially reduce school dropout rates and improve access to school.
The Decree of 20 November 2013 organizing joint policies between the Education and Aid
Youth must be implemented without delay and must be translated into:
Ensuring the establishment of consultation places provided by the Decree;
Providing the means necessary for the proper functioning of the facilitators provided by the
Fiat and responsible for facilitating the transmission of information and good practices;
Supporting local actors in their consultation processes;
Entering into a cooperation agreement with the Brussels Region and Wallonia.
Proposal: To ensure the articulation of sectors helps youth,
Disability and Mental Health
Some young people whose problems are at the edge of the fields of disability, health
Mental and youth welfare are not satisfactory response to their today
needs, both within taken into outpatient and residential load.
26
For more information on the proposals for Ecolo in these matters, see the thematic chapters.
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HELP YOUTH AND YOUTH - p 21/27 Although these issues fall under different power levels, it is essential and urgent to
conclude a collaboration protocol that allows tag and a joint intervention of the three
sectors.
Proposal: Ensure the implementation of the protocol on cooperation
unaccompanied foreign minors
This collaboration protocol between the youth welfare of both linguistic communities,
Fedasil and the Guardianship Service, provides a common framework for the three sectors,
to guarantee a welcome and a coherent management and quality to any minor
unaccompanied foreign ("MENA") present on the territory. The tag distribution of roles
each, depending on the laws and decrees governing and collaborative arrangements. It establishes
a point of contact "led" Standing within each administration (FEDASIL, Direction
General assistance to the Francophone and Flemish youth) to facilitate the evaluation of
problematic situations and, if appropriate, their management.
Ecolo means:
Support meetings between field workers and administrations within places
consultation provided for this purpose;
Support the establishment of contact points within each administration;
Supporting regular assessments of the protocol.
PRIORITY 6: IMPROVE THE MANAGEMENT OF YOUTH WHO COMMIT
FACTS OF DELINQUENCY
The transfer to the Communities of juvenile offenders provisions offers
possibility for the Wallonia-Brussels Federation to update legislation already widely
revised in 2006.
The future decree should bend the letter of the current law without upsetting: it must maintain a
balance of educational sanctions and individualized assistance. And include the right for
victims and for young people and their parents to be systematically propose an offer
restorative.
Like most actors working with these young people on the ground, is convinced that Ecolo
the successful reintegration of offenders through educational work and repairing,
Analysis of acting out and support.
Proposal: Diversify responses to youth who have committed an offense,
including intensive educational support (SAMIO)
Judges have many opportunities for reactions must put better today
enhance and encourage their use. Of these, intensive educational support of

youth (SAMIO) 27 implemented by the Ecologist Minister in charge of youth welfare, gives
satisfaction and offers encouraging prospects.
Ecolo therefore proposes:
ensure the optimal use of intensive educational support throughout the
Wallonia-Brussels Federation;

27

Sections Accompaniment, Intensive Observation and Mobilization.

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HELP YOUTH AND YOUTH - p 22/27

build teams that implement it where necessary;
ensure that the agreed services of the youth welfare stronger role in
care for minors who commit acts defined as offenses;
Judges encourage youth to use throughout the WallonieBruxelles Federation to the possibility of imposing public interest benefits;
deploy alternative measures that are not today, and first delivery
positive (training, participation in an organized activity ...) and training modules and
Awareness acts.

Proposal: To allow victims and perpetrators who want to access
mediation
The repair is an important step, both for victims and for the perpetrators of facts
offenders. Both parties, if they so wish, should be involved in the response to it
bring. This response should be constructive.
To achieve this goal, Ecolo offers:
improve the quality of communication with the victims, including strengthening
collaborations of the agreed services of the youth assistance with reception and
Victims;
systematize information on the right to mediation at all stages of the procedure and
allow potential participants to decide knowingly to go or
no ;
better training those involved in youth support this possibility of mediation;
encourage where necessary improved cooperation between judicial authorities
and authorized services.

Proposal: Improve the device IPPJ and consistency of supply post-IPPJ
The number of places in public institutions of youth protection (IPPJ) and center
closed has been increasing over the years. Since the 2000s, the ability of sections
closed tripled. A large number of times, this capability is not used 100%
including through the implementation of diverse responses. While constituting a response
appropriate in some situations, placement in a IPPJ must remain a last
spring.
Ecolo proposes to improve the quality of service provided by IPPJ and adapt it by
following:
For reasons both economic and educational and without making a rigid rule,
must bring the youth where they live, judicial authorities who are responsible
and social services that will enable better supervision and support;
Ensure the harmonization of the action of IPPJ and regulation within IPPJ
including through the implementation and evaluation of the implementation of the "code of IPPJ";
Ensuring that every young enjoys adequate support at the end of a measurement
placement by evaluating and, if necessary, adapting the supply of post-IPPJ support;
Aim for school reintegration of the young by enabling it to join as soon as possible
school outside JVIS order to register and the logic of
School bonding services;

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HELP YOUTH AND YOUTH - p 23/27

Before rehabilitation / educational reintegration phase, enabling all young people who do
not have to get their basic study certificate, ensuring compliance
compulsory education;
Evaluate and if necessary adapt the investment durations specified in projects
IPPJ of teaching.

Proposal: Improve the decision-making process of judicial authorities
In order to adjust the measures available to the youth judge the personality and
minor problems and individualize the decision up to the judicial authorities
take, Ecolo offers:
Meet the demand of many judges by creating an experimental basis first, poolside
multidisciplinary decision support, to quickly inform the judge of the
Youth on the action to be taken; this team must be able to react in time
a request for investigation judge of youth;
Experience a "reception and referral unit" in order to have a form of
dispatching for the Review and the proper orientation of youth. This section
constitute in the future a must for a maximum period of one month for young people
aged at least 16 years, for which public safety or security grounds
impose personal orientation in a closed section.

OTHER PRIORITIES FOR ASSISTANCE YOUTH SECTOR
Proposal: To support innovative practices in the aid sector to
youth
A budget must be guaranteed in order to support projects that meet, in an innovative way,
the needs of youth and families who are not covered by existing services. This is one of
means to change industry practices and in particular to meet challenges
which lie at the edge of several sectors.
After a testing phase, these initiatives should be evaluated and, if necessary,
spin-off from other services or perpetuated.

Proposal: To modernize infrastructure and reduce expenses
Energy services
The youth welfare sector is characterized by many very old buildings. Whether it
whether in the private or the public sector, energy performance of these buildings are
often very low. With increasing energy prices, part of more and more important
smoke of services operating costs leave. Young people and workers
are the first affected.
In 2013, a fund was created, allowing authorized service benefit from advances
refundable without interest to make these investments. This system should be continued.
Furthermore, it should continue the effort begun to improve the energy performance
buildings SAJ and SPJ IPPJ, both in terms of acquisition of new buildings
their renovation.

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HELP YOUTH AND YOUTH - p 24/27

Proposal: To evaluate the implementation of the Decree on youth assistance
The decree on assistance to young people over 20 years and was extensively modified in 2012. It is
imperative to assess its implementation and analyze whether the principles set out in the decree are
encountered. All the stakeholders: service workers, youth and families, will
be central to this assessment.

Youth, Education and Culture
SCHOOL
A school in the heart of the emancipation and
transition
Status and political horizon
State of play
Mirror of society, the school is located for several years at a crossroads. Requested all
shares, it somehow fills the roles that families want to entrust the World
work, the most diverse parts of society. Invested multiple missions and otherwise
supposed to correct all the evils of a world in search of landmarks, the school is under pressure.
And yet, the school and its players did not give up their ambition: to make effective
promises of emancipation, registered in the heart of the school system. Federation WallonieBruxelles, teachers, principals, parents rally at their level, to push
each student the maximum of its capabilities and make their school a place of friendly and citizen life.
Their action is often successful. Every morning, thousands of students take
way to school; each day, teachers are carrying out creative and innovative projects;
Each year, highly trained students graduate from our schools.
At the same time, the school remains profoundly unequal: school failure and relegation of
First of all sorts hit students from underprivileged backgrounds. Our education system Figure
among the most unequal in Europe, social mobility that represented the school plays more
his role. 30% of young people leave school without any diploma and each year 15%
children repeat in the secondary.
These findings are not new. The successful promotion policy officially alive
governments for many years. Yet, despite the avalanche of reforms
"Pedagogical" which, since the early 90's until today, have affected the objectives
and the organization of teaching, content of learning, access to education,
pedagogical tools, training of teachers, school failure, repetition and
Relegation pithy mechanisms remain within the education system.
Number of teachers, for their part, feel a sense of worthlessness of their trade, a
hand and complexity of their work, on the other. Thus, 35% of teachers leave the
ship in the early years in the profession.
Faced with this, since 2009, the "machine decrees" saw its pace slowing strongly in favor
a strategy focused mainly on pilot projects and supporting the emergence of
good practices in the field. If Ecolo supported this welcome development in the way
reform the education system, it is clear that simply support projects
pilots and promote good practice is clearly insufficient given the magnitude of the challenges
are ours. In addition, it still lacks Federation Wallonia-Brussels a real culture
evaluation of education policies. Reforms are abandoned, others are
amplified or initiated, without one takes the time to see whether these reforms have achieved
expected objectives on the ground.

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter SCHOOL - p 1/30

Result: in 2014, the French school still experiencing a double crisis: that of failure
persistent too many of his students, the discomfort and the growing shortage of its
teachers.

The political horizon Ecolo on compulsory education
For environmentalists, the interest and the emancipation of each child must be at the heart of
school policy. In this sense, the school is a key lever to change society in depth:
it is responsible for a fundamental issue of intergenerational transmission and reinvention
cultural. The school also aims to contribute to reducing inequalities and thus make
our just society.
This vision of the school puts students and teachers at the center of the game. Indeed, it is these
inhabitants' thousands of classes of the Federation Wallonia-Brussels who are the real actors
educational policies. Once the door closed, it is above all the chemistry between students and
Teachers will, or not, to achieve this famous objective of excellence for everyone. This
deep conviction invites its political thinking differently vis-à-vis action of school,
not forgetting to involve its internal and external partners are including parents
obviously an important place.
Ecolo confirms more than ever its ambitions for school without enough to believe that
to declare or launch pilot projects to transform reality. Indeed, the complexity of
our educational system requires fine political action, determined, concerted and enshrined in the
duration, which places its trust in local actors and integrates the specificity of each
school, which is itself connected to its socio-cultural environment.
However, Ecolo, through this program, is resolutely committed to qu'advienne finally, with all
the school partners, and in the interest of each child, teaching best suited to
our current society. Through the establishment of a true multidisciplinary common core
a "guidance-oriented" approach from basic education, the fight against school failure is
at the heart of our commitments. The desire for Ecolo also see if implementing
School basins inter-sectors, inter-levels and inter-network in order to strengthen
the capacities of schools within a particular geographical area, while providing
better school offers youth to enable them to build a future.

The Ecolo force lines for school
For the school can keep its promises of emancipation in this world in transition, Ecolo
intends to support a school policy for:
Allow each young to develop all its potential and take its place in the
company
Support teachers in their work
Improve and build new schools to meet the demographic boom
Piloting educational and differentiate the political system to stick to the realities of schools and
their school pool
Strengthening educational alliances to make the school a place of learning
Citizenship and Sustainable Development

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter SCHOOL - p 2/30

Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: ENABLE EVERY YOUNG TO DEVELOP ANY POTENTIAL
AND TAKE ITS PLACE IN THE COMPANY
Succession mechanisms set up by the Wallonia-Brussels Federation will succeed
not always ensure that all children acquire the basic skills, regardless
their cultural background. School failure and banishment of all kinds more striking
disadvantaged students. The results of external examinations organized by the Federation WallonieBruxelles highlight the difficulties some schools to bring their students to the
objectives; these schools are generally those that concentrate the most vulnerable students.
Without levers to remedy the problems revealed, external evaluations will only
aware of a reality that teachers already know and they will fail to
transform. Given this situation, Ecolo wants above all to mobilize all actors
education around the following aims: to give every young person the opportunity to make a choice
positive schooling and thus take its place in society.

Proposal: Strengthen the core
The priority today is the establishment of a genuine common trunk up to 14 years. By
"True core" Ecolo designates an educational continuum, like the model
Finnish, diversified learning content, while giving each student the opportunity
to explore its potential intellectuals, but also technical, scientific, artistic and body
before asking his choice of orientation at the end of the core curriculum. Only after this reinforcement
the theoretically existing core qu'Ecolo may consider lengthening the trunk
common in a second step.
In this sense, Ecolo means:
pay particular attention to the basic learning from teaching
fundamental, via the generalization of the immediate remediation and early detection of
learning difficulties;
consider incorporating a course or modules "discovery trades' in
especially during the three years of this core;
put up with the actors of secondary education (particularly Centres
PMS and teachers) or an alternative to the restrictive policy certificates
that require students to change industry or opt for an otherwise die
repetition. Rather than strengthening the logic of hierarchy between sectors with
restrictive guidance certificates, should accompany students in their
Choosing orientation and cross gradually, throughout the core
(especially at lower secondary).
organize, throughout each academic area, a one-stop shop in guidance
school. This window is the fruit of a partnership and coordination between all
stakeholders;
facilitate the transition between primary and secondary education,
including by the transmission of the results of basic studies certificate (CEB) and a
assessment of skills acquired by students in secondary school teachers;
strengthening educational continuity between the end of primary education and first degree

to open a debate on the future of the CEB and the first stage of secondary education.
The degree of self-observation trail (DOA) 1 should be seen in this context as well
the introduction of skills bases for the 10-14 cycle (like the pedestals
skills 5-8) to encourage collaboration between teachers at the end of primary and
early secondary.

Proposal: Mobilizing qualifying education in Wallonia
and Brussels
Ecolo considers qualifying education as a major lever for the transition of our Regions
and believes that the redeployment of supply and the educational quality of the course, there
including for its alternating sector, has become a priority for the coming years. In
Indeed, retention and relocation in Wallonia and Brussels of an economic activity
innovative, meaningful and sustainable employment, require training future professionals
and equipped and critical citizens to play an active role in this redeployment.
But these sectors, which are aimed at a younger two, take two faces today: the face of
these many qualifying sections that lead to actual path of success, both school
a professional; then the other sectors that remain face relegation places, symbols
of a dual school that in this case no longer fulfills its role as a social elevator.
Ecolo intends to implement this wide priority school basins (IPIEQ), so
allow mobilization of school actors, alongside socio-economic actors,
the scale of their territorial realities. In this context, Ecolo 5 package proposals.
After evaluation of the current functioning of IPIEQ, strengthen their means of action,
operating budget and autonomy of action. Whether on link
the provision of education and employment realities in the pelvis but also
technological equipment (advanced technology centers, centers of reference and
Competence centers), promotion of qualification courses, orientation, internships
business or calling transition between education and the labor market, the basins
School must become the body that coordinates and co-empowers local actors.
Specify at the Wallonia-Brussels Federation the purposes of qualification pathways.
In this context, it should not dissociate the education of qualifying stage
curriculum that precedes it. The redeployment of work qualifying education,
to be effective, must indeed be initiated within the core that must value all
types of knowledge.
Significantly improve the student orientation process for the positive choices
override the relegation logic, including the establishment in
each school basin of a single window in guidance or gathering,
when the building permit, the three streams (professional, technical and general)
in the same school or implantation rather than schools specialize by sector.
Strengthen the company offers internships to facilitate the transition from school curriculum
and the world of work. Rather than letting teachers qualifying education
knocking on doors to find internship places, also offers Ecolo
performed by a cadastral Basin school offering courses available.
Lead at the start of term, an assessment of the certification unit set up by
in some qualifying sections to ensure that the modularization is a track
pedagogically relevant, and adjust if necessary.

Proposal: To assess and strengthen the decree "differentiated supervision"
The decree organizing differentiated supervision of schools (instead of the decree
"Positive discrimination") voted in 2009 with the support of Ecolo, aims to strengthen the supervision and
the operational resources allocated to schools with greater needs, because of
features of their school population.

This differentiation policy aims to avoid the ruts of the past rather than
to provide a standardized and identical solution to all schools, adapt the modalities
finely as possible to the problems encountered in each of the institutions. In a first
time Ecolo proposes to conduct a participatory evaluation of the policy in place since
2009.
Secondly, Ecolo wants to increase solidarity between schools via the increase
progressive pooled resources (possibly at the school pool) and then
distributed differentially.
Finally, Ecolo insists that this human and additional materials will be mobilized to
concrete objectives and targets, related to the specific characteristics of the school population of establishments
school. In this context, Ecolo proposes to charge a member of the educational team (direction
or teacher) coordination and mobilization of resources. Time must explicitly
be devoted to such coordination; it is also necessary to provide school teams
multidisciplinary experts (researchers, educational consultants, inspectors, etc.),
promote innovative strategies and good use of the additional resources allocated;
organize moments of intervision with other teaching staff coaching in schools
Differential and external actors to share promising strategies in place; do
evaluated at regular intervals by the Wallonia-Brussels Federation and the educational team ellemême to measure the relevance of learning dynamics in place and make the
adjustments or improvements that are needed.

Proposal: Attracting teachers in schools with more
of pupils
The specificity of students differentiated coaching schools or special schools request
preparatory work and greater sharing: the number of hours worked
before the class should be adapted accordingly.
Similarly, the additional resources allocated to these schools will only be effective if
teachers working there are prepared for the challenges that will be theirs. In Ecolo there
therefore appropriate to take measures to attract experienced teachers or more
innovative in these schools in order to develop innovative and emancipatory pedagogies.
In this sense, the project set up in the Lille region of proposing so pretty
conclusive of new teaching disadvantaged students or new schools could
serve as inspiration for school projects in Wallonia-Brussels.

Proposal: Move towards the actual free compulsory education
If compulsory education is constitutionally free, the school actually costs too
dear parents, and this cost increases as and schooling. In a context of
school quasi-market, schools practices in terms of cost and speeches on the subject
are, a growing number of parents, determinants in choosing school.2.
Ecolo promotes an overall policy of reducing the cost of schooling in charge of families,
tend to run towards full free nursery and primary education and then

2

This is particularly highlighted what the League of Families in its latest study on the subject.

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter SCHOOL - p 5/30

secondary education. In this context, Ecolo has supported the Decree introducing a
obligation for schools to provide parents with periodic settlement of school fees
claimed. But to effectively reduce school fees and avoid abuses, other bad
more ambitious will be installed:
at first it is necessary to evaluate the implementation of the decrees provisions
for free (including the distinction between compulsory and optional charges fees
under the decree "Missions" and the periodic settlement recently set
up) and fixed by order of the maximum amounts for the said expenses "authorized" by
Class fees and globally;
evaluate the functioning of the 90% rule 3 it allows to effectively
largest number of children going on expatriation classes. Ecolo advocates
the adoption, in consultation with representatives of education, families and
operators expatriation classes, decree that would set quality criteria in
educational, safety, consistency with educational content and a
price ceiling;
encourage schools to adopt good practices free having made their
Evidence in other schools (bulk orders, grants to
school supplies, etc.);
ensure free for teachers in educational activities organized
school setting, without this be done through an additional cost burden to students and
their families.

Proposal: Advance the starting age of compulsory education and make
compulsory school enrollment as early as three years
When they enter primary school, sometimes children are disadvantaged in
academically because they did not attend nursery education. They have not developed well
prerequisite skills necessary for learning, such as acquisitions and psychomotor
perceptual-motor, socio-emotional and language skills. Children acquire indeed,
as they pass by the kindergarten, essential assets to their future academic path.
It appears once in essential to ensure that all children and regular attendance
Early school. Therefore Ecolo recommends one hand, a gradual lowering of the age of
the obligation to enrollment to 3 years and, secondly, a reduction of the obligation
attendance to 5 years. These provisions must be accompanied by an awareness of
socioeconomically precarious families the importance that represents an attendance
Early school.

Proposal: Provide each and every one of mastery français4
Mastering the language of education is an essential skill; because it is the key
essential for access to further learning and understanding of the world around us,
it conditions social emancipation, access to culture and the development of skills
cognitive and relational. However, many studies have shown, this priority objective of
mastery of the French language is far from being achieved, especially in Brussels and in other
big cities. To ensure everyone mastering the French language, Ecolo offers:

This is the minimum participation rate of students in a class required for the organization of outdoor activities
to the school and expatriation classes and discovery. This rate was modified by circular 75
90% in September 2006. Again, a measure with good intentions, but clearly the perverse effects.

Also ensure everyone mastering the German-speaking Community.

develop and adjust the reception arrangements and new arrivals schooling
(DASPA, formerly bridging classes) for the benefit of newly arrived pupils. Ecolo
proposes the following measures: allow students to attend bridging classes on
a full academic year (regardless of the time of year when they arrive in
school); systematize the establishment of a "French foreign language" option in
schools with bridging classes; strengthen training, autonomy and
status of teachers in bridging classes, and finally expand the beneficiaries of this

Proposal: Expand the Early Language Learning
For Ecolo, mastery of one or several languages, it is first and foremost an opening on
the world, an invitation to the discovery of cultural diversity. But we must also admit
that mastery of one or even several foreign languages ​​has become a Sesame
professional integration. It is symptomatic that the language training
Foreign, alongside training in the use of IT, dominate in
the provision of training for the unemployed as well as in higher education and
social promotion.
Ecolo poses the finding of a two-tier language teaching and regrets that so little has been
made during the last legislature on the matter. Indeed, on one hand, there is the large

As for the language immersion experiences that develop, aims to clarify the Ecolo

train future francophone teachers who intend to immersion teaching in diplomation with Universities and High Schools Flemish (as is already successfully
in some Hautes Ecoles).
Finally, Ecolo can not accept that young people enrolled in certain courses are qualifying private
second language courses, as this contributes to the difficulty of finding a job,
particularly in Brussels where the command of Dutch conditions access to jobs, even
low-skilled. It is important of course that the content of these second language training is adapted to the
specificity of qualifying courses.

Proposal: Integrating multimédia6 Support
For several years now, teachers and textbooks have lost their monopoly
the transmission of legitimate knowledge; they must now deal with the immediate knowledge
and accessed with a click on the Internet. Beyond this issue positioning of school knowledge
in relation to these new sources of information, the advent of new technologies

Additional learning in school here: the formation of autonomous users and critics,

Moreover, for the concept of digital Eco fracture must not be designed only in terms
access to computer equipment but also in terms of use. Governments
must play a central role of education in new technologies, especially towards the younger
generations. The young audience is for example increasingly tried, mainly through networks

what one makes available on the Internet, these data do not disappear and that there is a
number of confidentiality criteria that can be configured, are things that
are learned. This training could be given in the Digital Public Spaces (EPN)
even in the school curriculum.
To do this, Ecolo considers that particular attention should be paid to the following:
significantly improve the maintenance and replacement of used equipment. For this
how, resources must be made available by the Regions and shared between schools

teacher training);
promote and train teachers in the use of free software.

Proposal: Continue to support special education and move towards
school integration
Each child with a disability must be able to benefit from educational and school project
individualized, whether educated in mainstream or special education. In this sense, Ecolo
wishes to continue to support specialized schools and educational teams working to
quality education. In addition, Ecolo wants further encourage ordinary schools
specialized to ally together to treat the reception of different children.
Ecolo notes that the decree "integration" has increased the number of integrated children
in mainstream education. If many students already attending actually teaching
Usually, they are now receiving appropriate support. On the other hand, it is obvious
many brakes still limit the effective integration of children with a disability
in mainstream education: prejudice, the cost of integration, problems of transport,
too much separation between regular and special education.
To address these many obstacles, Ecolo considers it necessary to:
better organize the communication between regular education and teaching
specialized, including by drawing on innovative and successful practices implemented
in some schools. This is to support the integration logic, not only with
school actors, but also in the administration, inspection and centers
training ;

Proposal: To evaluate the registration decree and make, if appropriate,
necessary adjustments
For Ecolo, it is important that the registration process is a guarantee of transparency, simplicity and
equity. An objective analysis of the balance between the objectives of the decree passed under
this legislature and the decree of concrete results is essential today and will be
primarily conducted by the new government before any possible adjustment of the Ordinance.
Although "well up», transparently and fairly, is required to
begin to regulate school quasi-market, many people recalled, at the
debate on the decrees "inscriptions" successive, that simply would not be enough to register. For
Ecolo, it is essential to support pedagogically progressive increase
social and academic diversity of students. Ecolo and followed in the footsteps of Bernard Delvaux7 sociologist
UCL, when stating that "it is necessary to ensure that the small dose of mix introduced in the first

degree will quickly lead to the exclusion of the weakest students which would be introduced
where we did not expect them. For this, we must give teachers the tools they
can cope with the heterogeneity: practical training in differentiated instruction,
immediate remediation, "flying" courses for teachers on several classroom, etc.
Do not worry about it would be to ignore the difficulties already generating mixed in the first degree of
secondary and instantly condemn the eyes of teachers. " These tools should be
built with the teachers of these schools and have the support of external actors
(educational consultants, inspection, researchers, experienced teachers). They should

also fit in the educational project of schools and aim to meet objectives
encrypted "maintenance" of disadvantaged students or those with learning difficulties in schools.
PRIORITY 2: SUPPORT TEACHERS IN THEIR BUSINESS
Teachers are the first actors of school policies. At the heart of the relationship
pedagogical, it is primarily their activity that allows students to acquire the skills,
appropriating knowledge, develop attitudes of critical citizens, solidarity and
officials. After the string of political action, it is the teachers who give life to
educational reforms and their ambitious goals. Until the day breaks the link between theory
educational reform and practice of the profession; the day when the teacher feels to go
give way with a suitcase in each hand: the first containing the reforms, the second
the realities of his classe8.
This is what is happening today in Wallonia-Brussels: a gap widening between
official requirements of the authorities, on one hand, and the actual working conditions, on the other.
It is telling, for example, found that many teachers no longer know if they are or
should be, teachers, educators, psychologists, social workers or family mediators. They
say they are also sandwiched between the complexity of working with very different students
and immediate expectations of institutional actors (inspection, the responsible authority and
their representatives, politicians ...) or relatives.
International surveys (PISA) and external assessments reinforce this feeling
helplessness and loneliness teacher, indirectly pointed as responsible for
poor performance of the school or the entire school system; waiting for
concrete and operational responses to educational situations more and more complex,
the teacher receives an echo of misunderstanding or even suspicion.

Ecolo 2014 Program - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter SCHOOL - p 11/30 This devaluation induces the teaching profession and a growing malaise in our measurable
schools: the number of teachers who drop out of education has never been
important. What is particularly challenging is the early-dropping: 35%
of young teachers leave teaching for the first five years of business (and
20% just in the first year) 9. At the other end of the career, hundreds of teachers
seasoned but make their aprons worn every year. Finally, there are schools, increasingly
many who are no longer candidates with the qualifications required to teach,
particularly in technical subjects and language courses, and which therefore call for

Given all this, Ecolo considers it urgent to better support those who are

Proposal: Support and support teachers who start
Because entry into the profession is a pivotal moment in the career and determining
teacher, Ecolo proposes to deploy a range of measures that will respond
so targeted to the specific needs of beginning teachers:
gradually develop in all schools a collective dynamic Home
and support for beginning teachers. Ecolo proposes to build on what
works on the ground, releasing time for teachers who wore

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter SCHOOL - p 12/30 Proposal: Change initial teacher training
the reality in the art
It is clear now that only a high-level training may
develop the attitudes, skills and abilities required for the performance of a profession as
demanding that the teaching profession. National and international studies and the
observations of the actors of education converge to consider training
teachers as the most effective lever for change to bring structural reform
of our educational system, the challenges of the fight against school failure and inequality. In front of
the magnitude of the challenge, Ecolo proposes to act in two stages:
without waiting for a long-term reform that will take effect in several
years and gradually, should be taken as soon as measures today
for the training of trainers, collaboration Colleges-Universities to
valuation of tutors, strengthening internships for aggregations
upper secondary education (AESS) and strengthening the disciplinary baggage
for aggregations of lower secondary education (Teacher Training Course). These measures
allow one hand to correct the defects of the previous reforms unanimously
criticized by the participants in the Participatory evaluation conducted by Saint Louis University
and, secondly, to prepare the long-term reform.
gradually reform and the 2022 initial teacher training so
they are trained in 5 years. In his reflection, WallonieBruxelles Federation will necessarily incorporate the following tags:
-
Reform will not be content to simply extend the period of study:
lengthening the training must both strengthen the academic background of
departure and allow greater immersion in the art, in particular by
alternating avoiding a transition surprising-business training or
painful for too many teachers;
-
this extension may not lead modest students to abandon these studies
for financial reasons and must include a dimension of aid to successful
students, particularly first year of training;
-
Reform can only be realized when sufficient budgets have been
be identified by the Wallonia-Brussels Federation;
-
this measure should be accompanied by a progressive alignment of all
scales of teachers holders of a master with that of current holders
a master / license
-
the site of the reform of teacher training should not cover
only teachers and regents. It is also essential to review the
teacher training university-trained, especially to enhance their
educational background and their volume of training. Furthermore, should, on the occasion
the overhaul ahead of initial training, to end the outdated hyphenation
between regents and licensees in the secondary. The end of the core curriculum (second
secondary) could therefore be used in the future, logically, between the cursor
school teachers of core subjects and those of the common post-trunk;
-
the reform should be an opportunity for a global reflection on the teaching profession,
so that in future there is a greater awareness of belonging to the same body
professional, at the same institution. This particular requires a base
common skills that future teachers should share, regardless
the level in which they are about to give way.
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter SCHOOL - p 13/30 Proposal: Assess the continuing education system and bring it
the necessary improvements
Career training is now a reality that are appropriate to all
school actors. However, despite numerous quality training provided by interlined, in networks or in schools, it is clear that substantive evaluation is needed
before taking any measure to improve and enrich the training. Rather
than throwing the baby out with the bathwater, Ecolo therefore wants to evaluate with all actors
concerned - including teachers themselves - the implementation of this training device
mid-career and its articulation with the upcoming overhaul of initial training. This
such assessment should address the following elements: training modules
orphans, disaffection disciplinary training in favor of the cross-functional training,
training undertaken less for educational reasons and organizational (see replacement
teacher training), functioning of the mid-career training Institute
articulation with the network training offer ...
Then it will be necessary to proceed, without delay, the necessary adjustments for the device
continuing education actually meets the needs of teachers. The formation continues
is indeed an indispensable tool to support teachers in the complex
educational situations they encounter. In this context, Ecolo proposes the following areas:
integrated training modules, in addition to traditional training for the day;
enhancement of training undertaken outside of school time;
individualized training plans and long-term teachers can be
actors;
the development of continuing education as a tool for reform implementation
in schools and as a lever for the collective project implementation of educational teams
(including through training to prepare teachers to diagnose, to target
goals and determine priorities);
a diverse and differentiated offer according to different career stages and
different teacher training (High School, University, "Article 20") and in
the needs of teachers (teaching and learning but also on issues
transverse and school life);
more training given by experienced teachers and focused field
on collective exchanges related to the relationship between practical difficulties and solutions,
on the one hand, and theory, on the other hand;
a replacement system for teachers in training (interns or actors
socio-educational).
Ecolo regrets that, despite the commitments the Government has taken through its
Community policy statement, the Minister for Education has begun to think
that end of the legislature and has lost five precious years in this folder.
Proposal: Boost the teaching career
The teaching career is characterized by its uniform and straightness. While most
teachers love their job, the fact remains that many would sometimes relax in
Other functions inside or outside the school, sharing their acquired experience,
try another profession before returning to teaching, discover another
public school, or just bring their work from home. Similarly, of
Many teachers have personal resources that are insufficiently valued by
the current system.
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter SCHOOL - p 14/30 Ecolo believes that this lack of mobility opportunities is no stranger to the feeling of wear that
spreads in the teaching profession. It is important therefore to propose concrete measures to
energize and replenish the teaching career.
This is what leads to Ecolo to debate the principle of a career now based
meeting the "professional project" of the teacher with the school's needs, PO or more
largely of "basin". This formula, which is especially practiced in some Länder
German, provides that, every five years, the teacher layer on paper wishes
professionals for five school years to come (assignment, teaching materials, resources
Personal make available to the school community, continuing education, detachment
for other functions within the school, such as tutoring, animation or coordination
educational, or possibly outside of school: cultural associations, activities
associative or continuing education, ...). These wishes are then faced not only
Maps of the needs of the school and its organizing power, but also those of a
wider group of schools within the same basin.
This proposal, which is similar to a small revolution for the teaching career, but also
for the organization of schools, particularly require a common definition of a status
valid teaching in all schools, instead of the three statutes currently in force

Ecolo also defends the fact that we must allow teachers to diversify and expand their role
in school. One way to enhance the expertise accumulated by them throughout their
career (and which unfortunately loses at retirement) is their given responsibilities
intermediaries responsible for the support of beginning teachers, responsible
project management consulting, person responsible for bridging the implementation and monitoring of reforms,
disciplinary referent, "teacher-relay", etc.
Proposal: Strengthen the collective work of teaching teams
and autonomy
The valuation of the capacity for action of local actors is accompanied by a strengthening of the
collective dimension of the teaching work. To do this, Ecolo deems essential to provide
space and time in the school to allow educational teams to design, nurture and
assess their action. For Ecolo, the teacher's model alone in front of his class and one face
difficulties of his students not only exceeded but it is also unsettling for
teachers who do not have the opportunity to draw on the expertise of each other to
meet the difficulties and challenges they all face yet. In this context,
Ecolo offers:
develop methodological tools to better exploit both periods dedicated
to consultation in basic education. Similarly, in education
high school, class councils could usefully promote collective dynamic
between teachers and cooperatives;
ensure that the renovation and equipment of school buildings fit
This collective dimension of educational work. It is important that teachers
found in their school meeting infrastructure that responds to this aspect
important to their job;
better support educational innovations implemented in schools by
teachers, particularly through recognition by the Wallonia-Brussels Federation and
the granting of targeted resources for this purpose;
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter SCHOOL - 15/30 p create a guide with the different ASBL and associations that exist and that can help,
support teachers in their educational and teaching work;
enable educational innovation by ensuring, where necessary,
a relaxation of decrees or administrative constraints (particularly in terms
evaluation and class-groups);
Initiate action research on the issue of school timetables in order to identify
concrete ways for gluing more biological rhythm of the students.
Proposal: Make the teaching profession attractive to professionals
external to school
The shortage of teachers to school attracts women and men who have a
previous work experience. The contribution of these looks is rich and undeniable for
students. Ecolo wants everything to be done to attract the best people
in schools (especially when they are differentiated supervision) and of course
to keep them in the education system. But the task of these new teachers is not
easy and unenviable status. Ecolo also intend to support their integration into the school. In this
sense Ecolo offers:
recognize the seniority wage scale map acquired in the (s) business (s) earlier in
Since the teacher is committed to address its gaps in terms of
teacher training;
develop a specific continuing education offers for those teachers who
not have pedagogical titles so they can find answers to their
pedagogical issues and, if they wish, land a specific bachelor or master.
Proposal: Supporting teachers before, during and
after crises
The French Community since 2004 has mobile teams involved in schools,
at the request of principals, in a crisis among school actors (students,
teachers, management, third party). In addition, schools can appeal to
services of school mediators. To those still add others as
Regions, municipalities or associative actors working alongside schools. It is essential,
for both teachers and pupils, parents or directions, that these crises are
settled, and that mediation solutions are found sustainably. This applies as much of the
difficulty or even individual suffering, actors and their ability to continue their work
after the crisis, as the image of the school and the confidence it will benefit thereafter.
Ecolo wish, on the basis of a land registry problems encountered and of the answers
through existing mechanisms, governments can adjust and strengthen the capacity of
prevention and intervention, to stick as close to the real needs, including teams
education. This development will also take into account the need to better coordinate
all available resources and the operation of such devices and PMS centers, actors
first line alongside teachers.
PRIORITY 3: RENOVATE AND BUILD SCHOOLS TO MEET THE BOOM
DEMOGRAPHIC
Since 1986 and the drastic savings plan concocted by the Government Martens-Gol, the
school buildings were victims of a very detrimental to the preservation of divestment
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Youth, Education and Culture - Chapter SCHOOL - p 16/30 heritage. Nearly 25 years this regime have left school buildings in a general condition
concern. The disastrous attempt to launch a public-private partnership potential
ruinous for Wallonia-Brussels Federation has further aggravated the situation by losing close
5 years. Moreover, since 2010, population increases provided in Wallonia
especially in Brussels have given rise to new and urgent needs.
Therefore, during the 2009-2014 term, unprecedented investments were made:
1.2 billion € allocated to renovations and constructions for the creation of new
places (three times between 2004 and 2009). These efforts must absolutely be prosecuted
during the next legislature.
Proposal: To continue the policy of creation of new places
Brussels and Wallonia in order to adapt to demographic change
Under the exceptional investment plan of 640 million € in buildings
School decided during the 2009-2014 term (in addition to "traditional" investments
maintenance and renovation, bringing the total investments planned between 2009 and
2014 to 1.2 billion), a significant portion of the budget was devoted to the creation of
new places, both in Brussels and in Wallonia ... while there was not a € was spent
between 2004 and 2009. This way, more than 15 000 places "hard" to be created in Brussels
and more than 8000 in Wallonia through budgets of the Federation Wallonia-Brussels. In addition, end
in November 2013, under the impetus of Ecolo, an additional plan of 55 million €, to the
Emergency creation of 13,750 seats, was launched in addition to these 23 000 seats "hard"
to interface with them. The effort must be continued but it is clear
the Government was able to provide answers to the short and medium needs
term but also long term. Given the needs identified, but the effort must be
continued with the same enthusiasm in the 2014-2019 legislature.
This effort must be continuous evaluation so that seats creations fit
the needs of different school basins and that resources are allocated according to
this evaluation. Therefore, continuous monitoring (both basic education as
secondary) must be established. The creation and implementation of new schools must,
also be hingedly with the regions, as regards skills
urban and regional planning which they are responsible.
Beside that, it is necessary to adapt the statistical tools so they can determine the
maximum precision changes to a horizon of five years, which corresponds to the time in the field
school construction.
Finally, Ecolo intends to promote, wherever possible, maximum valuation policy
existing infrastructures via extensions and renovations, often less expensive than
new construction.
Proposal: To continue the renovation of school buildings by integrating
required energy savings
Sustainable development applied to the school setting, it is also a question
infrastructure and operation. The school, of course, is a place of learning, but it is
also the workplace of thousands of teachers and hundreds of thousands of students, to whom
Wallonia-Brussels Federation should ensure a healthy environment and working conditions
invite exchanges and conviviality.
Furthermore, it is appropriate to amplify the policy on energy savings, margin
growth remains important. Concretely, this should result in the following:

in school infrastructure, a measure provided in the St. Boniface Agreements

the next Parliament);
the revival of an investment plan, of a magnitude of at least one launched in 2010

and the creation of new places in Brussels and Wallonia;
the imposition of ambitious energy and environmental goals in the specifications

Specifically, the problem of radon11 must be systematically integrated as part

Proposal: To promote the opening of school infrastructure and
maximum use
Too often, school infrastructure remain unexploited outside of school hours
or they could be used for collective purposes, particularly in the fields of sport and
cultural. As is already the case in some places, heated school all day is no longer

deserted at the end of or during the weekend: it is used by associations, sports clubs, and
others who share therefore the maintenance costs. Ecolo wants to promote open
institutions on their neighborhoods and through the creation of management bodies for better
operation of infrastructure often funded in whole or in part by public money. In this
goal Ecolo offers include:
10

The exceptional UREBA 2013 program is intended to support some organizations who want to reduce consumption
energy of their buildings, it is the thermal insulation work on the buildings walls, replacement and
improving heating and lighting systems.

Radon is a radioactive gas present in the earth's crust and which, from soil and water, diffuses into the air and
found, by effect confinement in higher concentrations inside buildings The health risks
related to radon exposure have been established from numerous studies that show a link with cancer

the creation by the school pool, a management body responsible for the provision
these infrastructures to associations;

different users of the shared infrastructures:
promotion of joint projects funded by the way school infrastructure, sports
and cultural, which involves pooling certain resources;

PRIORITY 4: MANAGING THE EDUCATION POLICY AND DIFFERENTIATE
STICKING TO THE REALITIES OF SCHOOLS AND THEIR SCHOOL BASIN
In a political context marked by institutional discussions, voices more
Many amounted to claim, rightly, a better articulation between actions
taken by the Wallonia-Brussels Federation in education and realities of different
School basins. Parallel to this institutional issue means teachers regret that
pedagogical and didactic reforms, thoughts without them being difficult to use because
disconnected from the ground truth. At a third level, a research report
interuniversitaire12 concluded unanimously that the logic of school basins is the solution
the most feasible to curb the negative effects of our school quasi-market (inequality,
dualisation, competition among institutions and networks).
So many different signals that converge on the obvious: it is time that the authorities
government recognize that school policies are that they will secrete more
decree; it is neither appropriate nor required to build operational educational policies
apply equally to Saint-Josse schools of Louvain-la-Neuve or village
near Stavelot, Arlon or Tournai; it is now to focus on political action

local actors and intermediate players the choice of means to achieve them. The act of
trust local actors and intermediaries involved wishes to ask that must Ecolo
be accompanied by the human, material and teaching that enable them to take
this autonomy and thus, this responsibility.

Proposal: Spending political centralism collective responsibility through
school catchment areas
Ecolo calls for a new way of public action in education in Federation WallonieBruxelles that promotes dialogue and co-responsibility of the players to face the challenges
common and shared. It would decline in three levels:
Wallonia-Brussels Federation as a public regulatory authority, responsible for:
-

to define the missions, specific objectives, core skills and profiles
common qualification for all schools in the Federation Wallonia-Brussels;

-

accompanying their implementation (human, material and
teaching to the needs of affected populations school);

-

strengthen action and coordination means between intermediate players
(inspection, education consultants, internship masters) and strengthen their presence

For example at the Brussels level, to simplify the lives of relatives confronted Brussels

school, inform clearly and effectively on all the families of the offer
of basic education available in Brussels;
implement a real-time monitoring of database inscriptions
would refer families who have not yet found a place, educating their
schools where there is room and are, to the extent possible, near their
Home and expectations.

Proposal: Release the Wallonia-Brussels Federation to its role
organizer and strengthen the synergies between formal education networks
The Wallonia-Brussels Federation can continue to perform two roles simultaneously: that of
regulator and that of organizing power. This causes it to be judge and jury for all
schools it organizes.
Ecolo supports a formal education system managed independently by a body
and decentralized public school by basin. Also, Ecolo wish, as is the case in Flanders
for many years, an independent public body to resume the role of power
Organizing for schools organized by the Wallonia-Brussels.
This decoupling of the role of organizing power and control of the education system was not
brought to completion during this parliamentary term, even though the policy statement
adopted by the Government provided for the black and white. Ecolo therefore wishes the
next government begins work immediately and priority to this essential reform,
especially for the education network of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation, due out its
Current centralized and bureaucratic management in order to have an educational pilot
effective and non-politicized.
This decoupling should also be an opportunity to set up a dome gathering all
organizing powers of formal education, to strengthen synergies in
pedagogy, educational supply and human resources.

Proposal: Reducing administrative work of principals and
support as an educational teams coordinators
If teaching Federation Wallonia-Brussels is sometimes presented as a boat which he
is not easy to change course, rather Ecolo believes that the education system is a flotilla
composed of schools, each at their level, can cause global change. It is
therefore urgent to strengthen the attractiveness of this function suffering from a growing shortage in
structurally acting on two levers: reducing administrative tasks and
support of the Director or the Director's role as coordinator of an educational team.
The success of team work depends largely on the ability of principals to
assume their role of leadership and coordination of the educational team. It is known that, in a
school management regularly oven and mill. In basic education, aid
Technical remains minimal, given the extent of administrative tasks. The result:
directions schools find themselves alone in having to manage an educational team sometimes
dozens of teachers, where a government or company size

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter SCHOOL - p 21/30

similarly, they could count on intermediate relay. Ecolo intends to reduce the burden
of administrative principals include:
Significantly reducing the number of ministerial circulars that are piling on
offices of principals by the legislative inflation stop (consequence of a
excessive centralization of education policy) and a relief work and
coordination of regulations and circulars. In this sense, simplifying board
Administrative bringing together the administration of Wallonia-Brussels Federation and
Representatives of directors is likely to Ecolo, to contribute to the establishment
gradual and continuous best practice (informative cartridges, response times,
fusion flyers, time of year, etc.) to simplify and reduce the size of
the administrative burden on the part of school principals;
Strengthening the administrative support of the directions of basic schools and
pursuing their catch wage scale;
By helping directions in their facilities management function particularly via
audits and the provision of experts per school for performing pool
savings including through joint purchasing.
In addition, to support school leaders in their role of coordinating education team,
Ecolo offers:
Facilitate entry into the function through internships, a gradual entry into the profession and
coaching by experienced colleagues;
Breaking the isolation of principals by encouraging the exchange of good
practices, coordination and the pooling of resources and strategies face
common challenges. These meetings between principals could make internetwork
within school basins, as is already successfully Community
Flemish in the "schoolgemeenschappen";
More support for headteachers during moments of crisis in their
school or when they have difficulties playing the role of engine of their team

it should empower principals and their ability to learn

Establishment respondent so thin the diverse needs of these (routes
personnel, type of school and school children). This reinforcement will include forming
more principals in their role of setting collective project team
education (a diagnosis, identify goals, set priorities, coordinate
collective work and human resources).

PRIORITY 5: STRENGTHENING THE EDUCATIONAL ALLIANCE TO MAKE A SCHOOL
LEARNING PLACE OF CITIZENSHIP AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
Close observers of our educational system have regularly reminded that the school was
not alone. We must now add that teachers, either, not all alone. They
need allies to bring every student to meet the objectives set by the
Decree "Missions". In order to fill the initial inequalities, overcome difficulties
learning as soon as they appear, educating for citizenship, environment, media,
health, help orientation, stem violent behavior, improve relations between
school and parents, give a taste of the sport or music, you must create "alliances

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter SCHOOL - p 22/30

educational. " These alliances should be deployed inside school between fellow teachers,
CPMS, mediators, educators, health promotion teams at school ...; and out
thereof within the homework schools, cultural and sports associations, services
unconfined help, Planned Parenthood, libraries, the service of the attachment
school, etc.
Today we see, schools, services Assistance to Youth, CPMS and other
actors have adopted such practices. These collaborations, the fruit of knowledge
reciprocal exchange of best practices, working methods of construction
multidisciplinary and adapted to the realities of young people, demonstrate the relevance and success of
"Educational Alliances", internal and external to the school.
This requires dialogue and regular exchanges between teachers and their "allies". Also,
Ecolo proposes that, like the interesting dynamics implemented in pilot projects
initiated during this legislature, the collective work moments educational teams can
be devoted to this issue.
For Ecolo, the mobilization of school actors and school partners, expertise and
their enthusiasm is the most direct way to meet the school's ambitions. And these
ambitions, what are they if not the construction of a more sustainable and inclusive world? TO
a time when the mode of development of our society shows its ecological limits, social and
economic, it is important to remember those close links between values ​​and practices
sustainable development and education. This educational effort called for by the United Nations in the
part of the "Decade of Education for Sustainable Development" should result in
real direction of school knowledge, which involves a compartmentalisation of knowledge and weaving
very concrete links between learning and major social issues.

Proposal: Decompartmentalising learning and integrate
societal issues
Ecolo calls for the educational autonomy of educational teams is harnessed to
better connect the content of learning the challenges of our contemporary society. More
than ever, it is important that schools provide students with the keys to understanding and acting on the
logical socio-economic, technological, cultural and institutional governing the world
in which they grow.
Ecolo wants renewed confidence to local actors authorizes more
now conduct experiments unpublished decompartmentalisation.
Thus, on such critical issues as the energy challenge, intercultural or
overconsumption, teachers may decide to pool their contents and compare
their disciplinary approaches to help students build a complex representation and
Integrated reality. With regard specifically to intercultural school is Ecolo
believes that diversity is a reality more and more present in schools and that it calls
thoughtful measures. On the one hand, schools could, like the administrations and
companies be required to implement a true diversity management policy (as
Staff and students) would be integrated into the school development plan; on the other hand,
school staff member who, in big cities, concentrate a school population
mostly from immigrant should be able to exchange in the intervision sessions
Specific achievements of strategies put in place and having borne fruit.
In the same vein, Ecolo calls for an introduction to system operation
democratic, communal level at European or world level. For Ecolo, this initiation will
should not be done in a disembodied theory course but must be at the heart of the educational project
schools, particularly through dynamic Citizens Advice and all the approaches
democratization of the school system based on it.

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter SCHOOL - p 23/30

One way to reintroduce solidarity within the school while fighting against school failure is
support for tutoring and mentoring initiatives within schools, classes, between
children: either peer or between children of different ages and classes.

Proposal: Establish philosophical course to train citizens
twenty-first century
The current compartmentalization of students between courses of religion and morality is problematic
intercultural and civic society that we are calling for. On the field, teachers
religion and ethics classes did not wait for the policy to integrate social issues
in their courses but they face the limitations of the existing organizational framework.
For Ecolo, these "philosophical" said courses must promote "living together" young,
whatever their age and school attended, by bringing to treat questions of meaning.
In this sense, it must make them evolve gradually toward philosophy course and history
religions that would be built and delivered in particular by the current masters and religion
morality.
One way to achieve this short-term goal, that is to say without waiting for a necessary
constitutional amendment is to include in the schedule, both the primary and the
secondary and all networks, a new course that brings students to introduce them to
philosophical inquiry, to support their leader in active citizenship and their
provides keys to understanding of different religions and morals. This insertion of an
new course in a timetable (which may be aggravated) is possible by a reduction in
due to time zone volume of current courses of religion and morality.

Proposal: Diversify the profiles and professions in the school
Schools must, of course, have a pedagogical framework that allows for
optimal learning, but parallel to this, he is also to meet the teachers
which need to be better supported in their educational work, including the commitment
staff specializing in the management of social or psychological problems of the students. The
first allies of teachers are those who share their daily lives within the school.
Ecolo wishes that local actors can, depending on their needs, have the
flexibility and autonomy to diversify or strengthen either the socio-educational profile: educators, speech therapists, flying teachers, nurses and child minders,
therapists, social workers, psychologists, mediators, ... When this
proves necessary, these human resources could be pooled across
basin.
Ecolo is attached to the essential function performed by educators: facilitators of "living
together ", they establish personalized relationships with children and adolescents,
thus promoting their socio-emotional and intellectual development. Unfortunately, it appears that
educators too often are distracted from their original function to fill gaps,
especially in terms of administrative support. The work of educators, complementary to that of
teachers, is an integral part of the educational process. These jobs can be
diverted for other purposes.
Finally, in the nursery, the nursery nurses and child care workers also play a role
particular. But the majority of them still do not have an organic status while
many schools do not have them at all. Faced with this double statement, wants the Ecolo
Wallonia-Brussels Federation maintains its effort to stabilize a number of more
increasingly important to nurses and child care workers, and that the EPA released positions are assigned to
new commitments to meet the needs of the kindergarten classes that are
Today private.

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter SCHOOL - p 24/30

Proposal: Create true partnerships-school families
It is recognized that a good relationship between the school and the family facilitate education and youth
children. Yet for many years, means teachers and directions
complain that they are not the parents where they await - parents are often described either
as too intrusive or have resigned. Same time we observe that a number
Parents sometimes important to conflict with the school (use, lack of confidence and fitness
issue of teachers), now, what is worse, cut all ties with it.
Ecolo is convinced that the re-weaving strong links between the school and families through care
brought in daily relations through which the school and its teachers recognize
families in their diversity and behavior vis-à-vis the role of the school world. The relationship
between families and schools should be seen as a win-win partnership between the two actors
do not have the same role but both tend towards the same goal. Thus, many
practices identified by ATD Fourth World and the League of Families show that better than
big plans, this constant attention to the quality of relationships (notably by multiplying
contact moments and opportunities to participate in school life) allows an improvement
sensitive relationships between schools and families and promotes effective eg attendance
maternelle13 the school, thanks to a better knowledge and acceptance of the workings of
each.
These practices must point the function can play in welcoming and hospitable
after school, often the most regular contact between the school and parents who file
and resume their children to daycare. To allow them to play this role of facilitator link
between schools and families, it is important that they be integrated into the dynamics of
the educational team and they benefit from ad hoc training.
In this logic, Ecolo hope that in schools where mediators are present, and where one
meeting proportionally more parental dropout, their mission is directed
especially towards the improvement of school / family relationships.
In terms of school exclusions, Ecolo also proposes to conduct at first a
evaluating existing procedures and in a second time, in consultation with stakeholders
and out of school, work to improve procedures to make them simpler,
transparent and fair. Must be remembered, school exclusion is always a failure for both
student for the school and teachers.
Finally, Ecolo believes that the Participation Councils must play a greater role on the ground
alliances between the school and its environment: in addition to being a place of dialogue between
representatives of teachers, OP, parents and students of the Councils Participation
indeed been designed to also involve potential allies in the educational dynamics. For this
do Ecolo deems necessary for the early organized an assessment of the functioning of
Participation Councils, in order to identify places which hinders or impedes, then
local democracy elsewhere this instance is source projects of all kinds.

Proposal: To support and develop synergies between actors
school and those of the youth assistance

In addition to school-family partnerships, it should develop a partnership between
school professionals and those of the youth assistance, which are at the forefront
additionally involve educational teams. The decree on joint policies between
education and youth support aims to realize this partnership will and
collaboration. The deployment means for applying this decree will have to mobilize energies
that all stakeholders can take ownership for the benefit of jeunes14.

Compulsory schooling begins, in fact, at the age of 6 years.
See in this respect also our proposals in Chapter "Youth and Youth Welfare".

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter SCHOOL - p 25/30

Proposal: Articulate the school to its environment
School time rarely corresponds to professionals schedules of parents. Many
Students of primary education who attend school daycare until 18pm.
There are also many parents who want their children to enjoy 2 or 3
hours of free time after school, when they had fulfilled their school work, doing
sports, music, theater, go to library, Ecolo ... upholds the principle of "contracts
Local Children "through which, from an inventory of needs and Home
resources available on the territory of the community, parents, schools, associations, organizations
youth, sports clubs, build appropriate responses and unpublished Partnerships
accommodate children under 12 outside school hours.
Ecolo wish this logic Contracts local Children's swarming across the
compulsory education and it leads the school to integrate permanently in their environment. TO
Like the "Brede scholen" in the Netherlands, Ecolo sees the future of education in logic
broader educational partnerships in which each of the roles are clearly defined and
where the school assume a central function.
Thus, next to the school time devoted to learning, students will tomorrow
benefit from a consistent and coordinated range of sporting, artistic, cultural,
associative prolonging these apprentissages15. The term "school, place of life" then take
its meaning, since it will become the core of a true educational network, cooperative and negotiated.
This "articulated school" could be the engine of education projects to the environment
involve teachers complementary scientific branches and centers
the regional environmental education (CREE), the Idea network, or other associations
of environmental education. Similarly, the link would be facilitated between, on the one hand, actors
the promotion of health and family planning, and on the other hand, the animation modules

schools of Wallonia-Bruxelles16.

Proposal: Improve nutrition at school
Ecolo wants to make the school a privileged partner for the promotion of good practices
Food, in collaboration with associations of parents and health actors. Young people
and children spend almost 35 hours a week at school, it usually take a meal
(meal bread, whole meal or meal type "fast food"), a - sometimes two -
snack (s) and for some who remain in school after class, an afternoon snack. It is therefore undeniable
that the power outlet in the vicinity of the school is essential as part of the equilibrium
food. For Ecolo, you have to change school catering to a sustainable diet.
Thus, Ecolo intends to support the initiatives of local actors (offers soup or fruit 10
hours instead of the snack, organize a tea-sandwiches for the children that remain after
16 hours ...).
If the model of specifications (products from organic agriculture, fair or channels
short) school meals distributed by the Wallonia-Brussels Federation will certainly in
common sense should nevertheless facilitate the appropriation of this tool by schools, by making
available to them, within each school pool, facilitators, consultants
sustainable food. This new function qu'Ecolo propose17 created to accompany
schools on the path to good eating practices actually may assist them to
realization of the specifications for the preparation of menus, to ensure a suitable logistics
(eg to receive fresh produce) and adapt the work in the kitchen ...

In addition, Ecolo wants the schools are all equipped with water fountains
current, in order to provide children in good hygiene, water quality.
Ecolo argues more broadly to a "diet plan" established a comprehensive and coordinated way
the scale of each establishment. The participation council is the appropriate place for the
design and implementation of this plan, which must involve all stakeholders:
parents, students, administration, teachers, heads of canteens, commissary, promotion team
Health at school (PSE), ... Similarly, the presence of distributors and sodas
"Junk food" in schools should also be reviewed, following a debate with all
actors of school life.
Finally, the school is a key player in preventing obesity and overweight, by
particular through the intervention of health professionals in the scope of the school (PSE).
Early detection of obesity is essential for the timely management of overweight by
other health professionals.

Proposal: Promoting sustainable educational mobility
Promoting sustainable educational mobility, it is of course interested in travel patterns,
but also to the volume displacement. In this regard, Ecolo reiterates its commitment to schools
proximity, which play an essential role in weaving the social bond in neighborhoods or
villages. The clear benefit of these schools in terms of mobility is coupled with an educational interest:
young child, who has no need for taxis parents to join his school experiences faster,
with pleasure and pride, autonomy that will help him grow.
In terms of modes of transport, primarily intends Ecolo encourage the use of
soft modes (walking, cycling). This is why intensified cyclist and pedestrian policies
for pupils and parents. Thus, additional financial resources should be
released to generalize to all schools patents cyclist. Similarly, the practice of
ranks on foot or cycling and carpooling should be encouraged and better supported.
But it is not always possible to go to school on foot or by bike, why Ecolo
also intends to facilitate the use of public transport. This important measure is
be accompanied by a voluntary policy to increase capacity transport services,
to absorb this influx of additional passengers, either in areas where the
peak supply is already saturated by the application, or in areas where the supply is very low
if at all. Free public transport (STIB, TEC, SNCB) must also apply for
activities that take place during school time. For these two proposals take
their full effect, Ecolo wants to load the public transport companies with a mission
initiation and education in the use of public transport, as is already done with
success in some school basins.
More broadly, Ecolo want to give them full speed to School Travel Plans (PDS)
Coordinated by the municipalities. In Brussels, the PDS demonstrated by the
practice they were relevant and effective, so it should be guided to strengthen this
dynamic Wallonia. In addition, Ecolo wants to strengthen ties between the PDS, on the one hand, and
Municipal mobility plans (PCM) or inter Mobility Plans (MTCP), on the other.
Finally, school transport is a right for all children attending special education
and who have no other possibility to go to school: it must be comfortable and safe; the
Staff should be trained in the management of disabled children and the various groups
forms of disabilities; adjustable seat belts should fit all vehicles. It is
also essential to take account of different disabilities experienced by children, to
to adapt the length of the path and the frame as a function thereof. In addition, to shorten
the journeys of children attending special education, it is appropriate to provide for Ecolo
answers for school provides not only for school transport. Indeed, the
poor geographic distribution of schools of special education according to the levels and
areas considered to have a very significant impact on the quality of school transport. Finally,

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter SCHOOL - p 27/30

Ecolo wants to start a school emergency basin in reflection to determine how, when
the interest of the child permits, it can be integrated into mainstream education, and where
necessary, beyond the interest of this integration for their personal development, how it
Also avoid long trips.

Youth, Education and Culture
HIGHER EDUCATION
Residents with critical citizens
Status and political horizon
State of play
In a society in transition, higher education is the focus of attention. He
responsibility to convey to as many knowledge and skills necessary to meet
the challenges of the 21st century, while enabling each and everyone to realize his life project.
The attractiveness of universities, graduate schools of Arts (ESA) and universities
Federation Wallonia - Brussels (FWB) is undeniable. Between 2001 and 2011, the population
student increased by nearly 20%. Over 2000 graduates of the short type of training
choose each year to borrow the gateways to the masters, which lead themselves
specialized training. Adults are, moreover, the choice of resume studies
after a period of professional activity. In addition, the attractiveness transcends borders
national, since in five students is of foreign nationality. The grand opening of our
scheme allows wide access of public higher education. Our accommodation
therefore obliged to significant efforts to bring to student success in numbers
growing and varied courses.
These developments have inspired several reforms Wallonia - Brussels in the legislature
2009 - 2014. Thus, positive steps have been taken regarding free and
democratization (free for beneficiaries of a study grant, freeze tuition
for all students, setting free online course materials), reform of studies
health that ended at Community supply restrictions or strengthening the system
study grants.
Furthermore, said reform "of higher education landscape" created new
coordination structures bringing together players in the Academy of Research and
Higher Education (ARES) and géographiques1 pole, embodying the commitment in Ecolo
for democratic support of the development of higher education. She
also has an important part reorganizing the academic year, giving more
flexible courses to students while preserving the structure of curriculum in years
academic.
Furthermore, the first alternate masters courses were launched in September 2011
as a pilot project entering into the logic of the Marshall Plan 2.vert. For now limited to
four programs in high schools, this experience could be extended to new projects
case of positive evaluation and with the appropriate tags.
Finally, many debates have enlivened the sector during the past five years. Low levels
success in the first year and constraints on funding institutions are
rightly denounced by different actors. The next legislature will have to provide answers
adapted to these recurring observations, while supporting the implementation of reforms undertaken
since 2009.

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HIGHER EDUCATION - p 1/16

The political horizon of Ecolo for higher education
The role of higher education in the formation of citizens and critical citizens and
is qualified capital. Access to knowledge and a thorough understanding of reality is a
valuable asset for individual emancipation and integration in a growing company
complex. The rise of more training level is essential for
social, economic and cultural development of a democratic society. For Ecolo, the issue
remains central.
The training in high schools, colleges and universities of the arts
shall result in the skills and knowledge necessary to carry out the project
personal life. In all sectors, interdisciplinary and critical distance vis-à-vis the
knowledge should be targeted as well as the acquisition of specialized skills and
valuable in the job market.
This project can not succeed without the support of all stakeholders. On the one hand, the participation of
members of all staff and students in the management of the system and the definition of
guidance is essential. On the other hand, the dialogue must be encouraged to allow
institutions to work harmoniously and build partnerships. The
Governments must promote the achievement of these objectives at all levels by organizing a
steering and effective higher education funding.
The pursuit of these objectives will require new efforts of the FWB in future. As elsewhere
in Europe, welcoming a wider audience in higher education is a
difficulty, which is marked in particular by high failure rate in the first year. This
massification puts the funding of our institutions under pressure. For the future, Ecolo wishes
that new means be released in order to create the conditions for success for the greatest
number while ensuring excellence of our higher education.
The main points of the Ecolo project are therefore the following:
Promote success
Ensure equal access to higher education
Ensure effective public support to higher education
Open higher education to contemporary issues

Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: PROMOTE SUCCESS
Our universities, colleges of arts and universities each year lead to success
a very large proportion of students, allowing Francophone Belgium to know the rate
of higher than average européenne2 graduates. The important failure rate in first year
Bachelor however highlights a major challenge of our educational system to the hinge
between compulsory education and higher education.
Moreover, even if it is relatively constant over the last thirty years, the first failure
year bachelor's not a seasonal virus irreparably mowing some cohorts
students. The idea that one could detect early failure and thus deter some
students to register is contrary to the emancipatory vocation of our education system. There
no inevitability in failure: success rates can be influenced favorably by
investment in innovative teaching methods in an effective orientation

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HIGHER EDUCATION - p 2/16

students out of high school, in the frame in the first year of Bachelor or in the
development programs open to different disciplines.
Several efforts have been made to improve access to education, particularly in
the legislature ending, thanks to the support of Ecolo. This dynamic democratization
access should help maintain a high rate of access to higher education (cf.
Priority 2) above but must be accompanied by proactive measures democratization
the success of those who register in order to pursue the prospect - committed there more than one
century - to access for all to knowledge and qualifications

Proposal: Identify and generalizing practices for success
In recent years, involved in education have developed many
policy initiatives, remediation and support for students arriving or
intending to continue their journey beyond compulsory schooling. This dynamic is
stimulated by the expertise developed on this topic in academic circles, which inspired
varied experiences. The FWB supports these efforts by assigning specific resources
for several years.
The in-depth evaluation of these practices should be the first step in a
politics of achievement in higher education. Participatory structures set up by the
last reform of the sector bring together all stakeholders concerned by this
theme within a specific commission. Ecolo wish that this opportunity is seized
for :
share experiences and practices developed by the various types of education
superior ;
identify methods that provided the most convincing results;
arrange (decree and budgets) to the generalization of these
methods.

Proposal: Strengthen guidance tools
The transition between secondary and higher education is a particular moment
sensitive in terms of access: the young decides whether to continue his studies under different
factors (family, socioeconomic status, personal project, job prospects ...). It should
to ensure that future students have a maximum of assets in order to operate the
policy choice in any clairvoyance.
In most cases, higher education institutions and PMS centers offer
prospective students an information and referral service on higher education. Of
Many centers also subsidized information pursue this goal. In addition, several
collaborations between secondary and higher education available to inform future students about
the choices occurring at them, such as open days and meetings with
teachers in higher education organized in secondary schools. Finally, the FWB has recently developed
a search engine to locate the higher education provision.
All of these initiatives should be encouraged and integrated into a dynamic
Common to ensure effectiveness. The steering bodies created at the end of the legislature (ARES
and poles) provide useful framework to carry out this work. In this perspective, Ecolo offers:
to develop an integrated referral service bringing the active services in both
of guidance regarding education levels (CPMS3, "guidance" services) to

Psycho-health centers.

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HIGHER EDUCATION - p 3/16

stimulate reflections and joint actions and to explore new opportunities in the
field;
to develop the recently launched website in place to centralize it all
essential information for informed guidance (prerequisite, course organization,
Pedagogy implementation, gateways, outlets ...).

Proposal: To develop links between secondary and higher
The gap between secondary education based on relatively clear goals and skills
and higher education in which the objectives are less defined and skills
less formal identified is another factor complicating the transition between these two
levels of education. In this regard, the development of a structural collaboration between the
players in the secondary and higher education would reduce this
difficulty.
Ecolo such wishes the following opportunities are captured:
encourage meetings between teachers of secondary and higher education to their
allow to better identify their respective realities, for example through mentoring
spouse of certain works or organizing activity days dedicated to this
end ;
initiate the establishment of a genuine educational continuum between the two levels to
ensure consistency between the prerequisite of higher education and the level achieved
at the end of secondary education.

Proposal: To strengthen leadership
The higher education funding mechanism in a closed envelope to the conjugated
steady increase in the number of students in Wallonia - Brussels recent
decades has led to a decline in the rate of supervision in schools. The efforts
point made by the government and those made by the institutions with the means
they have are beneficial, but does not improve or even maintain the
teaching conditions.
To reverse the trend, Ecolo supports the principle of differentiated financing
higher education institutions to guide resources to mentoring
public knowing the lowest success rate, especially students first
generation. These resources must be used to promote methods and modalities
the most conducive to a successful organization: small group work, participatory pedagogy,
interdisciplinary approaches, remediation sessions ...
The pedagogical training of teachers and supervisors must also be a
particular attention. Since 2006, a specific certificate for teachers exercising
High school was created to strengthen the educational tools necessary for their function. Ecolo
wants training giving access to the fitness degree in higher education (CAPAES)
be accessible to all teachers in higher education. As regards more particularly
universities, a reflection should be launched on the development of educational activities
the career of scientific and academic staff to a level equal to that of activities
research.

Proposal: To promote multidisciplinary in bachelor programs
Outside the necessary contributions in human, the democratization of success in
Higher involves examine how studies are organized, and in particular in
the early years of the curriculum. In this regard, we note that most of the training courses organized

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HIGHER EDUCATION - p 4/16

in higher education are part of a division into disciplines or professions. The
multidisciplinary programs are rare and are found mainly at Masters level. In
some cases, bachelor students can choose to spend some of their training
outdoor lessons to their curriculum or to enroll in undergraduate programs
giving access to a multiplicity of masters, but these opportunities are limited.
Earlier curriculum, interdisciplinarity represents a real benefit: it prevents the student to
partition immediately in a specific sector. This dynamic allows everyone to build
his study project throughout its journey, without undergoing failure automatically or return
back in the program in case of reorientation. It is also beneficial to students whose
choice is already established, whose formation is found enriched by the confrontation with the disciplines
multiple.
The creation of graduates combining several disciplines or types of education therefore has
many educational benefits and can be a way to fight against early failure
in higher education. Ecolo wish this track is seriously explored and projects
already registering in this perspective are the subject of support and a special assessment
in order to identify strengths and weaknesses in practice.
Proposal: Strengthen links between courses of education
superior
Any student may extend or reorient its curriculum through gateways defined by
stopped. This mechanism facilitates transitions between different types and streams of education
higher, particularly by offering students the type runs a possibility of acquiring a diploma
Master, upgrading skills already acquired. This process often involves passing
with a preparatory year or a complementary program.
Despite the efforts, the transition from one type or a die at a (an) other radical an approach
complex. The identification of acquired skills can sometimes be daunting, like that
Prerequisite courses related to accessible by this route. General rules are planned,
but they do not help to clear up any situation. Furthermore, we find that
students attending the preparatory year are a public "at risk" in terms of success.
These gateways, carrier decompartmentalisation, promote democratization of access to
degrees. Special attention must be given to support student success
who engage in this process. As such, Ecolo offers:
to better determine the necessary prerequisites for addressing years of studies in
Gateway an objective assessment of students' skills at the end of each
Bachelor type;
to encourage synergies between the various types of education organizing courses
linked by bridges to ensure the continuity of educational courses
students;
enable students intending kind of short for a reorientation towards the long type
anticipate some during the preparatory year as part of internship activities
("Bridge course") in the third year of the Bachelor.
PRIORITY 2: ENSURE EQUAL ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION
Beyond issues related to success, the question of affordability remains crucial in
democratization of higher education. Again and again, the choice of undertaking
studies often means giving up income and solicit family support, which
causes an additional burden for households and implies a relative loss
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HIGHER EDUCATION - 5/16 p autonomy. In other cases, the student is forced to work to support his project, which
is not without effect on the chances of success and quality of life. This situation carries
inequality, as evidenced by the precariousness in which many live étudiants4.
For Ecolo, a citizen who chooses to study to be encouraged. Higher education does
can be fulfilling if they involve giving up its autonomy or quality of life.
Everything must be done to reduce these barriers, which affect the least
haves. Efforts to promote access of all public higher education in
Optimal conditions must therefore continue.
Proposal: Improve the efficiency of the benefit system studies
To facilitate the access of socioeconomically disadvantaged students, the Federation Wallonia -
Brussels organizes the award of study grants. This system can offer assistance to a
about five students. This proportion remains low: many students are in difficulty
excluded by the criteria used - in particular we think of those who experienced more failure in their
academic background. Moreover, the allocation does not substantially cover the costs
direct and indirect related studies5. This aid mechanism, although beneficial, is insufficient to
several respects. To allow our higher education to be accessible in
democratic conditions, it is necessary to upgrade these allocations. After contributing
actively to efforts in this legislature for improving system.6, Ecolo wishes of
New advances in the future, such as:
removing the criterion sanctioning failure, true "double punishment" considering the
well-established link between failure and the social situation of the student and that student
failed several times already subject to restrictive measures for inclusion;
increasing the number of students receiving, reviewing the ceilings giving
access to benefits;
the revaluation of amounts of allowances in connection with the development of costs
indirectly related to education;
strengthening the study grants department to improve the processing time
applications and eventually enable the payment of the allowance as from September;
updating the list of types of studies opening an entitlement to benefits, including
to incorporate the training of higher education and social promotion
specialization studies.
Proposal: Reforming the registration fee and promote democratic access
to course materials
Since the academic year 2010, new measures in favor of free
higher education are vigueur7. Ecolo campaigned for these advanced and closely followed
their implementation.
However, many students are poorly informed about the existence of this new law on
course materials. Those who are must sometimes face prohibitive procedures
benefit. In addition, teachers have at times been subject to excessive constraints
4
For more information on the proposed Ecolo on this, see Chapter "Fight against poverty".
The allocation amounts to an average of a thousand euros, or barely 10% of the total cost of a year at the top.
6
A reform has extended to the entire curriculum the profit for the year "joker", preserving the right to allocation
after a first failure, better take into account commuters resident students at more than 20 km from their place of study
and make a series of technical and administrative details.
7
Registration fees have been reduced to zero euro for scholarship students, who can also benefit from
free printing of compulsory course materials, now available online just as free.
5
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HIGHER EDUCATION - 6/16 p arising from an overly strict application of the decree. Conversely, some institutions have
distinguished by good practices.
In most sectors, the existence of educational materials reference is valuable for
student success. Ecolo wants to generalize the most favorable practices broad access
mandatory course materials, especially the establishment of a system of
checks enabling the scholarship student to benefit from free training materials without
having to advance the amount when purchasing.
Furthermore, the recent reform of higher education called harmonized rules
on registration fees. Ecolo has defended and obtained the extension of payment deadlines
registration fees until January in all types of higher education. For
Subsequently, further progress should be considered, such as:
extending the possibility of deferral of payment of any fees along
académique8 the year;
the introduction of additional modalities for reduction in school fees, in addition to the current
through rates and extension of free school fees for students whose income
little exceed the ceilings giving entitlement to a study grant.
Proposal: Propose housing available to students
The problem of student housing is of particular importance in terms of access
Democratic studying. Indeed, for citizens who do not have the opportunity to realize their project
study near their place of residence, access to housing near the place of education
is a decisive criterion.
Studies of student housing needs has been conducted by the Walloon Government and
Brussels. It appears that it is the quality and price of kots, far more than their nombre9 which,
generally speaking, a problem. Furthermore, students are sometimes clueless
their owner.
To remedy this, Ecolo propose10:
to perpetuate the social estate agency mechanism (AIS) "student" and extend it
to municipalities with high student population. This formula meets the absence
an intermediary between owners and students guarantees quality at a price kot
affordable and stimulates the supply;
support the creation of public housing buildings for students in
investment programs of municipalities in which the mismatch of supply and
demand for student housing is established;
strengthen partnerships with universities and colleges and increasing
devices to better inform students about finding accommodation
(eg platform "Brik" in Brussels);
to support any initiative aimed at developing the student homestay in
an intergenerational perspective, like for example the experience "A roof, two
ages ".
For the rest, better support for establishments with a rental fleet available to
students should be considered, especially to guarantee priority access to the least public
favored.

Also the proposals of the Chapter "Housing".
9
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HIGHER EDUCATION - p 7/16 Moreover, many students prefer for cost issues, share a dwelling
than renting individual kots. But because of the regulations and mainly
non-individualisation of rights, they are penalized if they regroup and
share a dwelling. Indeed, when the student has a replacement income, a
unemployment benefit or an integration income and is cohabiting, the amount of
allowance is automatically lowered. Thus the economy of scale to which habitat
pooled finally sanctioned. This situation is unfair and surreal in a context where
affordable and decent housing is too scarce; it is also in the field of savings
energy. To terminate, Ecolo proposes to individualize sociaux11 rights.
Finally, current leases do not allow to take into account the condition of the students. A
reorientation earlier this year, a study period abroad or second session up
often difficult for kotteur. A rental deposit equal to two months' rent
prohibitive and also little justification for rentals of this duration.
In the context of student housing, it is appropriate to consider possibilité12:
to conclude a lease for only ten months, extendable in the case of second session and
allowing termination in time reduced in case of change of orientation in
beginning of the year or going abroad for example;
allow subletting a kot or transfer the lease during the year if
foreign trip ;
to limit the security deposit of one month's rent.
Proposal: Make it easier for foreign students
The opening of our higher education system to foreign students is a
cultural exchange opportunity for Belgian students attending the same audiences. She
constitutes, moreover, long been an important form of development cooperation.
Ecolo will facilitate procedures imposed on foreign students from outside the European Union
wishing to enroll in an institution in Wallonia - Brussels. Improving
devices equivalency diplomas of foreign students, especially for better
information and greater efficiency of the administrative department in charge of these equivalences must
be put to the agenda. Furthermore, Ecolo calls late application fee levy in
part of the registration process of these students as well as the reinforcement of the arrangements
accompaniment of foreign students (housing assistance, language support, access to
school supplies and textbooks, etc.).
Proposal: To facilitate access for students with special needs
For people with disabilities, access to higher education is fraught with
physical barriers, educational, social, cultural and psychological. These barriers can
be reduced by accompanying measures and specific equipment. A lot
institutions have developed projects in this perspective. In addition, the Federation Wallonia
- Brussels has recently adopted a decree supporting these initiatives. Ecolo wish this
dynamic continues to allow students with special needs to carry out their
study project. The poles recently created must allow the pooling of efforts and
develop new initiatives to ensure the right of all students to treatment
equal.
11
On this subject sections "Social Security" and "fight against poverty".
See in this respect the Proposal to amend the Civil Code to provide special rules for leases
Students filed by Ecolo in the House of Representatives.
12
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HIGHER EDUCATION - p 8/16 Proposal: To facilitate access to education of people inserted in the
active life
Interest in higher education of persons included in the workforce is growing:
whether to resume studies previously abandoned, with a view to reorient
professionally or for continuing education. Ecolo wants to lift the obstacles
the access of these citizens to higher education.
The valuation of acquired originating from prior work and life experiences to
Graduate is an interesting mechanism. It allows to provide the interested
Some courses, but also to promote a comprehensive approach to training, made to
both experiences from practice and learning reaped in education. She is
also particularly suited to the needs for training. However, although a
skills validation system and professional and personal achievements are in FWB,
it is clear that few institutions actually play the game of the opening to this
validation. Also, Ecolo has increased awareness of the issues of settlements
the validation of acquired experience, as well as strengthening practical arrangements
to extend its implementation.
Moreover, the shift schedule to offers of higher education must also be supported
and multiplied to meet the continuing education needs of workers and
workers, with special attention for those whose working hours are irregular, this
which sometimes allows them more regularly attend classes.
PRIORITY 3: ENSURING EFFECTIVE PUBLIC SUPPORT TO EDUCATION
SUPERIOR
To meet the many requirements imposed on them (as in the entire system
education), the government support for universities, colleges of arts and
universities is vital. This investment in higher education to achieve missions
First usefulness for society and for each individual who composes it. It's a
capital dimension to social, economic and cultural.
The student audience was up 25 percent over the past fifteen years. Constraints
hanging over the funding of our institutions must integrate this new and
the allocation of resources must meet many needs. The sensitivities of each
must be able to combine in federative projects, directed to development
New training and enhanced services. Finally, special attention must be paid to
personnel responsible for these important missions.
Proposal: To implement the reform of the educational landscape
higher and support the dynamics of decompartmentalization
The landscape of higher education in Wallonia - Brussels is characterized by
disparities between different types of education about the services offered for
educational community, the unequal territorial distribution of the offer or the lack strategies
agreed at the summit between the different actors. The structures put in place as early as next
returned under the decree says "landscape" will, for the first time, integrate
all the actors in a logic of dialogue and coordination to address these
weaknesses. Ecolo supported this positive dynamic. The abolition of historical borders is
best way to develop new projects for the benefit of all and in the
respecting the specificities of each and every one.
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HIGHER EDUCATION - p 9/16 Beyond the institutional issues settled in the 2009-2014 term, it appears appropriate to
put in place the right incentives so that the ARES, the poles and areas meet the objectives
which were respectively assigned to them in service and mutual respect
infrastructure, support to the success and management of higher education.
Ecolo especially wants to enter the following opportunities:
developing new courses in sparsely filled territories, in
through collaborations involving institutions in the vicinity;
integration projects on preparatory activities for education, guidance,
remediation and instructional support to teachers and supervisors, as detailed
in Priority 1;
pooling infrastructure (housing, restaurants, libraries) and services
administrative possible to offer benefits equivalent to students and staff
all types of education;
the production of statistical indicators and research to inform
various realities of the sector and to open new perspectives in continuity
work already carried out;
the upward harmonization of social budgets, in particular to guarantee rights
equal to all students, regardless of the institution or the type of education
frequented in the perspective of a single student status.
Proposal: Improve the financing of higher education
In Wallonia - Brussels, subsidies granted by public authorities to
higher education institutions are organized on a principle of sealed envelopes
distributed in proportion to the number of students (except colleges of arts).
This formula does not follow the growth in student numbers. Thus, these
years, despite some additional funding, higher education has undergone
structural reduction in funding per student. Indeed, the number of students is
constantly increasing while the budgets, they do not increase accordingly. This
situation is denounced by most of the players who see the conditions in each year
work or study deteriorate.
For Ecolo, there can be no question of increasing the fees charged to students or
restricting access to higher education to address the issue. Instead, a new
funding mechanism must be developed so that institutions can continue to
offer quality training to all students they host. The progressive output
the closed envelope should be one of the priorities of the next Parliament.
Furthermore, the means must be better oriented to basic needs. Far formulas
related to "yield" (scientific publications, diplomas) considered in some
media, public funding must remain linked to the number of students enrolled and consider the type
Public welcome to allow institutions to target the success of each. For the
next Parliament Ecolo thus defend:
the gradual release of the sealed envelope and maintaining public funding
higher education linked to the student population received by each establishment
and taking into account the evolution thereof;
the establishment of a differentiated funding for first generation students or
from less affluent, as envisaged by the circles Interuniversity study commissioned by
the Government of the Federation Wallonia - Brussels;
taking into account the specific research missions conducted in universities,
on the one hand, and higher institutes of arts, on the other;
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HIGHER EDUCATION - p 10/16 strengthening incentives for the development of specific missions (promotion of
success, social diversity, sustainable development, development cooperation ...).
Proposal: Support personal careers
Changes in the number of tertiary students as part of a closed envelope,
incentives to mergers and the European harmonization plan for higher education
resulted in a charge of casualization, functions and staff regulations in
all institutions and higher education levels.
To support the career and ensure a better professionalization of personnel
higher education, Ecolo offers:
ensure fair treatment of personnel expenses by ensuring visibility and
transparency in reporting vacancies, enhancing the coherence between
During conferring titles and required (to protect against arbitrary), fighting
discriminating against decisions (keeping young people in precarious statutes,
disinterest in their fifties, promotions in the absence of objective criteria ...)
to clarify and harmonize the statutes of different categories of personnel
different types of higher education to strengthen equal treatment and
easy passage between mid-career institutions.
PRIORITY 4: OPEN HIGHER EDUCATION TO CONTEMPORARY CHALLENGES
Higher education is not a fortress, impervious to the needs of society. So,
when governments and educational institutions organize educational provision
higher, they must consider the needs of particular socioeconomic basins,
market and non-market enterprises, associations and public services: they are,
indeed, the future employers of young people when they are trained.
For Ecolo, sustainable participation of teaching to current socio-economic challenges should
not be at the expense of the general character of the expected critical training provided
universities, colleges of art and universities. If our education contributes to
the formation of citizens capable of adapting to changes in society - whose market
employment - and also to contribute by their creative and critical potential, it should be avoided
instrumentalization of education to economic and adéquationnistes purposes only.
Proposal: Meet lasting societal needs
To promote an intelligent collaboration between higher education and society and
mark the presence of the private sector in institutions and educational issues, Ecolo offers:
to ensure, with adequate educational support, the general character and transferable
skills acquired business and avoid the pitfall adéquationniste;
make structural masters the pilot delivered in alternating high
schools, following the positive assessment by the sector. These masters must allow
economic or technical baccalaureate holders type short to continue
curriculum if they wish, without replacing or competing with existing training and
confronting these students to a variety of professional experiences;
increase, within partnerships with companies, projects developed with
social economy actors and associations, so as to enable young people
immerse themselves in a multiplicity of professional worlds;
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HIGHER EDUCATION - p 11/16 develop the possibilities of masters and doctoral programs oriented practice
professional within universities, so as to facilitate deployment of
high level skills for professions taught by such as
and will address some of the current challenges, for example in the field of energy
renewable, climate, food, health ...;
improve the quality of courses. Internships, first dives in life
professional, are essential moments to make the connection between theory and
practice, to learn about the future working environment and the overall context
in which the student will develop later. It is also necessary that the means are
available to make these powerful and useful courses. This particular requires a
Good supervision job shadowing and work and special training for
persons responsible for supervising internships;
to establish, in the end, career development programs
in the study area (resume writing, coaching, network development by setting
Contact students with industry professionals, awakening to the workplace,
etc.);
develop action research projects that can combine high students
schools, universities, but also qualifying education and services to companies
to improve the technical or social practices or to better understand the
societal issues.
Proposal: Organize international experience for all courses
The European Bologna process has greatly encouraged student mobility, this inside
but also outside the borders of Europe, with a target of equivalence
diplomas is not yet sufficiently met today.
Public resources have also been made available to support this mobility, but these are
insufficient. Only a minority of students accesses the experience of mobility during their
course. In particular, students with lower incomes, held back by cultural factors
or financial, as students from non-academic sectors, are involved in this little
mobility.
Finally, the level of teachers and institutions, new missions generated by these
experiments have not been accompanied new ways. In addition, mobility is often
conditional upon mutual exchange, so that only certain programs deemed "most
interesting "at the university level are available. The material conditions are not
immediately ripe for a rapid and significant increase in student mobility.

Given these facts, Ecolo wants to encourage other ways to integrate the international aspect in the
study content. Thus it is important to develop the following experiments: Organization
viewpoints on matters within courses and international meetings on campus,
distance learning opportunities (take a course from a foreign university by
videoconference) or remote working meetings (teleconferences between teachers) and
the reception of foreign students in our institutions. Training provided on our territory
in a language other than French also contribute to the internationalization of
Higher Education.
The implications of higher education institutions in cooperation projects
Development also allow to penetrate international issues
university premises for the benefit of teachers, students, and Northern partners
South. For Ecolo, these special partnerships should be encouraged by
valuation of these activities in the academic career of teachers and higher
opportunities for students from the Federation Wallonia - Brussels, to carry out a part of
their education in the partner countries.
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HIGHER EDUCATION - p 12/16 In terms of actual mobility Ecolo proposes to put in place a series of measures
allowing the medium term, to make international mobility experience accessible to
large number. To do this :
Scholarships must be adapted to real income students (as scholarships
language distributed under the Marshall Plan for students completing their 6th
secondary) and quotas for students scholarships to lower income
must be increased;
awareness campaigns for students and their families must be organized to
strengthen the interest for mobility during their studies and to remove certain cultural barriers
in contravention of this mobility;
international scholarships should be offered to all training
and types of education, including higher education outside universities and
social promotion;
multiple partners countries should be maintained to ensure diversity
cultural training and fight against a dominant form of thought; to this end,
maximum quotas scholarships for some popular countries (USA, England)
must be defined and mobility to emerging and developing countries
encouraged;
Finally, to reduce the environmental impact of journeys made under the
International mobility, less polluting travel arrangements (train, carpool)
should be encouraged whenever possible.
Proposal: Boosting the attractiveness of science courses
While we are in a moment of transition and fundamental transformation of our
economy, jobs and patterns of production and consumption, it is clear from various
Studies that future students evil surround the reality of training and technical and trades
scientists. This causes a certain disaffection with these sectors and this despite
many opportunities they offer to their graduates.
To make the attraction to scientific studies and careers, an integrated approach
higher education involving representatives not only of education but also the
research and economy in its different dimensions is needed. This is one of the missions
assigned to the advisory committee created within the recent ARES. This new tool should help
stimulate thinking around new initiatives highlighting technical and higher education
scientific.
In guidance efforts must fully integrate this dimension. It's important to
provide prospective students with clear information on necessary skills, content and
methods of scientific and technical training and the realities of business to which they
provide access.
Particular attention should be paid to the gendered approach to this policy work since
notes that young girls hardly orient toward the sciences (apart
health sectors) even if they have successfully completed a secondary education
Scientific dominant.
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HIGHER EDUCATION - p 13/16 Proposal: Establish schools santé13
In Wallonia - Brussels, physician training runs for several years
numerus clausus federal limiting the number of doctors allowed to exercise their métier14. This
disables device access and quality of health care: rural or precarious regions
in lack of general practitioners, hospitals lack specialized doctors, some
specializations are in total shortage and some institutions seek foreign doctors,
while some doctors installed in Wallonia or Brussels work in conditions
dangerous to their health and that of their patients.
The removal of quotas specialty related to certain specialties shortage will possibly
some improvement but will not solve the difficulties encountered in some basins.
Ecolo offers fully replace the INAMI quota mechanism by developing a
decentralized system of regulation of the medical offer based on assessed needs and organized
by care basins. The offer must indeed meet local requirements definition and based on
a medical facility planning; in particular, it is necessary to promote the
installations where lack of doctors and prevent the arrival of doctors where supply is already
exceeds the needs. Several bills have been filed in this regard by Ecolo.
Ecolo considers that access to education must remain free. It is on the information provided to
Students need to build better manage the orientation of study choices.
Ecolo proposes to reorganize the initial training of health professionals by setting
up of health schools. Action should be taken at source to develop a health policy
comprehensive and multidisciplinary, from prevention to care, primary care at the hospital. he
These include direct training industry professionals to health and not
only to medicine, build a training related to the type of service
go to the people, to consider that health is the case of a multidisciplinary
professionals who share their team skills. It is therefore to adapt the content and
training system for future health needs. This challenge is shared by many actors
Health.
The organization of an initial core curriculum for universities and high schools involved in the
compliance with specific educational projects for everyone, and gateways allowing shifts
in the same area give a common and directed "health" culture at all
professional health professions. It will provide the versatility of early grades
and the establishment of bridges between different health training, including with
colleges (physiotherapy, podiatry, nursing ...). At the end of normal years, the
number must be determined with universities, the choice of a final chain will be easier and
probably more appropriate. This system would also enhance, next to the healing, the
preventive and palliative care.
Training content must integrate public health dimensions promotion
Health and multidisciplinary work that are now virtually absent. The approaches
Psychosocial should also be further developed to meet current needs.
The social responsibility of academia is to help provide training for
trades and skills "health" which the company needs. Ecolo want this site
opens as soon as possible, with the participation and in consultation with them.
The Legislature in 2009 - 2014 has laid the foundation for this reform driven by long-Ecolo
dated. Efforts in this direction should be continued in the future, building on the resources
existing professional and academic and drawing on similar reforms undertaken
including France, Switzerland and Canada.

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter HIGHER EDUCATION - p 14/16 Proposal: Support the training of artists
The quality of artistic creation in Wallonia - Brussels is recognized in
multiple domains. Colleges of arts, including international attractiveness do denied
not greatly contribute to this recognition by providing a training framework
specific enabling our artists to develop their skills and get recognized titles.
Ecolo wishes to support art education as a sector of excellence include:
encouraging young artists to engage in these courses;
taking care to preserve the diversity of projects and training courses organized;
developing collaboration between the types of secondary and higher education
concerned.
Proposal: Ensuring equality between women and men in
Higher Education
A study published in the course of the 2009-2014 parliamentary showed net
gender disparities in education supérieur15. If the student has
strongly feminized in recent years, this is not yet the case of body
academic and scientific which remain overwhelmingly of men.16 compounds. Instances
BI universities experiencing the same situation.
These disparities reflect the many difficulties still facing women
engaging in an academic career. In higher education, as in other
sectors, corrective measures can help ensure equality in fact. In this
perspective, Ecolo offers:
ensure a balanced representation of men and women in forums
responsible for appointments of academic and scientific staff, as well as in
various higher education institutions management bodies;
to develop within a specific instance ARES dedicated to gender issues
in higher education and research at the Federation Wallonia -
Brussels ;
encourage higher education institutions to appoint a person or
department responsible in the matter and to take action favorable to equality;
to realize the project to create an advanced master in Gender Studies, y
involving all actors willing to invest in it.

CULTURE AND MEDIA
A culture of creation and emancipation
Free and diversified media
Status and political horizon
State of play
Culture
Many have tried to define culture. Perilous exercise, as it is rich and covers
different realities, including "the values, beliefs, convictions, languages,
knowledge and the arts, traditions, institutions and ways of life through which a person or
group expresses their humanity and the meanings they give to their existence and
development.1 "Cultural policies respond in that social needs and
democratic individuals. They evolve with changes at work in society.
Cultural policies and continuing education must adapt to these changes and contact
in the general population. This is not always the case: some parts of the population
remain "forgotten culture."
Second, globalization has an immediate impact on cultural diversity. It can lead to a
increased trade, improved access to works from here and elsewhere in
interculturalism. But we are also seeing the spread of a culture increasingly homogenized,
often referred to the "mass consumption". The concentration of economic power
also very pregnant in the area: it is the model of the "star system", where a number
reduced players win the bet.
Finally, digital developments impact sectors including audiovisual, sound,
Book and film and grow to rethink economic models. Digital today
integral part of contemporary tools of creation in all artistic sectors. The
public practices have also changed. Digitisation and the Internet provide opportunities
huge in terms of dissemination of works, heritage conservation, to make them
accessible to the greatest number. The policies must accompany the transition
digital sectors and for everyone to have access to these tools, the fight against fracture
digital.
In this context, the cultural and artistic sectors continue to show great
vivacity and creativity. Artists repair our cities suddenly plastic arts, create
creating new spaces, new artistic formats, reinventing recovery. The
associations and citizens develop new models of cultural democracy, human
sharing, exchange systems. The initiatives flourish and dynamism unabated.
Faced with these complex but promising sector issues and constantly in turmoil, the
cultural policies must be conducted to standard. Yet they are often relegated

cultural and other actors, yet also spearheaded the creation.
Rebalancing and a better allocation of resources must be ensured. Policies
cultural and continuing education in Wallonia-Brussels Federation have more need than ever
a new life and a new vision.
Media
The news media, as public broadcasting that the private press, are also subject to
profound changes. Especially the print media for several years through a tsunami
economic and technological. The sector is under intense pressure: falling sales
"Paper newspapers' competition from other media players on the Internet, decreasing
advertising revenue. Mergers, takeovers and restructurings succeed in the sector,
Workforce newspaper companies often pay the price. This trend towards concentration weighs

Going digital also entails the transformation of journalistic professions. More and
Moreover, the journalist must be able to write for both paper and digital media, it must
work twice as fast, with the consequence of reducing the time available for
integrate information and conduct in-depth analyzes. This economic context and
technology can represent a threat to the working conditions of staff, but
also for the quality of information. But these are fundamental issues for democracy.
At the same time, media professionals innovate: neo-journalism, magazines
participatory, new publication formats ... In this area too, creativity is required.
A very assertive support should be given to this sector to support the development
twenty-first century media.
The political horizon of Ecolo for Culture and Media
It is from the recognition of the role of art in society, essential pole emulation
and cultural dynamism, rethinking public support for the creation and artistic work.
Ecolo therefore intends to focus on artists and on an economy of creativity. If the company has a
influence on cultural policies, the reverse is also true. Cultural practices and
arts, continuing education contributes to the empowerment of citizens, their education,
their participation in social life and the reduction of inequalities.
Also, the culture is a fundamental right for every individual. It is recognized as such by the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in Article 272: "Everyone has the right to
take part in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in advances
scientists and benefits resulting therefrom. " In this sense, culture is a common good,
collective renewable resource. It is therefore important to protect cultural diversity and its role
major in the creation and transmission of values, placing strict limits on the influence of
liberalized market.
Each must also have access to free information, diversified and quality. Pluralism
Media is a key democratic issue. It is a response to social and cultural needs of
company. It is in this light that it is rethinking public broadcasting policy and
support to other media, particularly by enabling support for economic development
and Digital transition from print.
Finally, Ecolo intends to defend the principle of a "cultural politics differently". Respect for
governance principles, political ethics and transparency and the fight against
scattering of public funds and patronage, are at the heart of our vision. The

"Everyone has the right to take part in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to participate in
scientific advancement and its benefits resulting therefrom ".
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CULTURE AND MEDIA - 2/29 p cultural policies that fall within the jurisdiction of several levels of power, it will be
take concerted and coherent actions, European municipalities.
Ecolo force lines are therefore the following:
Support artistic and creative jobs
Create and defend a culture of creation and emergence
Promote a culture for everyone, factor of emancipation and education
Valuing our heritage and build on the digital
Change political practices and review public and private support to culture
Ensure media pluralism and quality information
Supporting media literacy and enhance diversity in the media
PRIORITY 1: SUPPORT EMPLOYMENT AND CREATIVE ARTS
Proposal: To adopt a genuine statute for artists
To provide opportunities for artists to create, live and work in decent conditions, the
Parliament must provide a clear legal framework which takes their professional reality
"Intermittent" and creation into account.
In the absence of a real social status, the program law passed in 2002 allowed to grant
Artists comprehensive social protection through the scheme for salaried workers. But since 2011,
plan to protect the intermittence was gradually dismantled by the measures taken
federal level. Indeed, in October 2011, the NEO - overstepping its powers - issued a
interpretative circular restricting access to the status of artists and reinforcing discrimination
between eux3. In January and February 2014, the Minister of Social Affairs and Labour Minister have
adopted new provisions while the lack of information and consultation with the
sector was screaming. These provisions do not go in the direction of sustainability of the sector
artistic, quite the contrary. On the one hand, artists must obtain "professional visa" which
the conditions and criteria are not defined, which leaves room for different interpretations
and arbitrariness. On the other hand, the conditions for access to protection and intermittent
unemployment benefits are strongly hardened, artists will now be paid more
for the application of the rule of cachet4 under the same conditions, the steps
are heavier administrative ... With this reform, young people and technicians are all
simply threatened with exclusion from the status of artist!
Ecolo therefore proposes to implement a thorough reform of the legislative framework governing the
artist status that would allow:
to end the existing discrimination between artists - performers and creative artists -
and technicians and incorporating all categories of artists and disciplines;
to grant social protection to artists and technicians, including young people, regardless
the type of contract, to enable them to exercise their professional activities
good conditions;
3
Since then, the Brussels Labour Court denounced the inconsistent use that NEO has made its power
interpretation. He also condemned the lack of notification of these decisions to the unemployed, or when there are any, they
poor motivation. The Labour Court also recalled protection intermittently.
4
The stamp of the rule permits the inclusion, for access to unemployment performing artists, a number of days
Working calculated by dividing the gross compensation received during the reference period, by an artist reference salary
reference amount for the calculation of unemployment benefits. Otherwise, the income received during the previous quarter
calculation will determine the reference amount.
Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CULTURE AND MEDIA - p 3/29 to respond to the realities of the artistic work (and in particular open-plan nature
transversal and intermittent) maintaining different forms of contracting;
facilitate the procedures and simplify the administrative procedures for artists;
to allow artists to perform certain non-artistic services in particular
training and education, without losing their rights.

Proposal: Establish a comprehensive policy to support
artistic jobs
The artistic and creative use depends on a number of skills: in particular,
Cultural Policy (Wallonia-Brussels), aid to employment (Regions) and the right of
labor and social legislation (federal). Professional artists realities are complex and
are characterized by a multitude of characteristics: short often contractual commitments
term variability projects undertaken, working relationships with partners who can
be different each time, organization of variable time and modulated according to the project ...
Therefore, rethink the artistic and creative work can not be done without to reflect
globale5 with all sectors on possible support measures at all levels
Institutional.
Ecolo offers:
to establish a sustainable tool for harvesting and analyzing data on employment to arts
Maps have a professional activity in Wallonia-Brussels,
collaboration with the regions and the federal state;
to study the conditions of employment of artists and creative operators in order
to adapt legislation and develop policies specific job (type
contract volume of artistic and creative jobs, development of skills and functions,
remuneration of creators);
load the Observatory of Cultural Policies a study on the impact of culture and
artistic work on economic development.
Support measures to artistic jobs at all levels
Ecolo wishes the implementation of measures to improve the number and quality of jobs
Artistic:
encouraging the involvement of artists, creators and the entertainment technicians
subsidized structures within the Federation Wallonia-Brussels, in areas
of audiovisual, performing arts, literature and visual arts. This is, for
do so, to further clarify the specifications in terms of creation and employment
Art in the program contracts or agreements of these structures;
dedicating calls for specific projects and scholarships for young artists to output
training;
strengthening and perpetuating aid in the creation culturels6 budgets.

Ecolo has already initiated this process of reflection by organizing numerous meetings with artists and representatives
sector, so as to open the debate on the tracks to consider for the establishment of an artistic employment policy
coherent, reform of the status of artist, the defense of equal treatment, interdisciplinarity and diversity
cultural.
6
Also the proposal "Leave room for creation."

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CULTURE AND MEDIA - p 4/29

Fund new jobs on the basis of social Maribel device
The fund "Maribel social" finance of new jobs in the non-profit sector. The
arts sector does not have access to this device since the artistic work
often not within the scope of the employment contract benefiting from the Maribel funding.
However, this sector includes many structures that would greatly interest to pool
reductions in their social and employer costs.
Ecolo therefore proposes the creation of a clean Maribel fund arts sector, allowing
financing adapted to the reality of professional artists.

Proposal: To ensure a balance between remuneration of authors, access to
culture and creative freedom
Ecolo proposes to create a place of permanent consultation with the relevant cultural operators,
the collecting societies of authors and powers of guardianship rights, the issue of
exceptions to copyright. It is considering the possibility of establishing exceptions
Regarding small cultural operators (small places dissemination or small rooms
concert) or associations that perform public service tasks (such as
libraries, youth centers, for example.) An adequate compensation mechanism
should be developed in order to respect the right of creators to be compensated.
As part of this consultation, Ecolo want to consider the possibility of review of such schemes
European and Belgian legislation on copyright and related rights. This is to take
measures to protect and promote the public domain and creative freedom.
Ecolo would also like:
make available all the creators and authors of the instruments of understanding
and extension of copyright, in collaboration with management companies
collective;
ensure the proper information of the authors, with particular reference to digital rights through
culturelles7 the wicket of information.
The remuneration of authors and creators on the web
Internet and digital tools provide immense opportunities in terms of access to works,
the cultural "products", archives, information ... The fact that everyone can have access to
this diversity, this knowledge is a fundamental democratic issue, it's a question
equality.
At the same time, forms of righteous retribution must be provided to authors and
creators, in what is becoming more and more a "cultural digital public space." It is
imperative that the digital economy can also generate value for the creation of
content.
For Ecolo is taking into account that these two issues should rethink a balanced diet
Copyright. And the Internet being "global" that is at least at the level of the Union
European that it should be built.
For Ecolo, the scheme has the following objectives:
strengthening the contribution of digital actors (such as multinational
like Google and Yahoo) and national level, cable companies and suppliers
Internet access to the financing of content creation on the basis of the model
globale8 license;

the development of legal and free content;
Development of possibilities for agreements between authors and platforms
Release: television stations and their websites, archival platforms, etc. which
allow to open the way to new types of culturelle9 broadcast.

PRIORITY 2: FOSTER AND DEFEND A CULTURE OF CREATION
THE EMERGENCE
Proposal: Make way for the creation
For Ecolo, the creation must be at the center of cultural policies: it enables the emulation,
dynamism, renewal. Yet it remains the poor relation in this sector.
Major institutions (large theaters, opera ...) must remain places of productions
news, laboratory, lighting of creation. But it is also to support
alternative venues, the emergence or small production workshops. The establishment must receive a
most important specific and structural funding and arrangements shall be set up
to allow young artists and creators to engage in a professional career.
Ecolo offers:

creating international networks of young designers.
Supporting Performing Arts
Ecolo wants a reflection with the Scene of the Arts sector in order to achieve genuine development
Flat theatrical landscape and support system to:
strengthen and sustain the creation aid;
objectify support criteria to operators stating their cultural missions;
enhance the specificity and diversity of supply in the theater world;
enhance the area of ​​dance and choreography;
reinforce the dissemination of shows, in particular via the network of cultural centers.

Proposal: To promote our artists and promote their works
Belgium and the Wallonia-Brussels Federation full of talent increasingly recognized on the
international scene. It is also with the Belgian public that our artists must find their
spot !

Belgian film seen in Belgium ...
Belgian cinema is an example of this paradox: while the films have a
remarkable recognition abroad and round up prices, the Belgian Francophone public
knows little. Ecolo therefore wants to improve their promotion and dissemination.
Ecolo offers:
to encourage collaborations between art cinemas and testing to diversify
offering programming and enhance the Belgian cinema;
strengthen the dissemination of Belgian films in the context of television on demand, and
work in partnership with the RTBF for strengthening the promotion and dissemination of
works on its channels and websites;
to work on making available digital movies lawful access internet,
offering the public an offer affordable, varied, enjoyable and easy to use;
encourage initiatives and diverse cultural venues film promotion
Belgian, especially among young people (such as the price of film students, for example).
Supporting Belgian musicians
The national musicians - with the exception of a few stars - sometimes have difficulty
find their place in the musical landscape of the Federation Wallonia-Brussels.
Ecolo offers:
to provide increased support, particularly through the project to help, to emerging musical culture
and non-classical music (especially rock projects, indie, hip hop, rap ...) and
that electronic music;
rebalance also helps to support emerging artists and the
places and alternative festivals;
to support musical creation in connection with multidisciplinary works: arts
stage, radio creation, movie soundtracks and documentaries;
increase the presence of these artists on radio by increasing the diversity of
programming and dissemination of works of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation;
without interfering in the freedom of places and festivals, to encourage more diversity
in planning and promoting events allowing operators to
meet the artists (such as Pro Pulse Festival).
Support the museum and promote contemporary art networks
Ecolo intends to support the development of all the museums of the Federation and WallonieBruxelles better promote their activities with the public.
This will encourage collaborations between public and private actors to make them
works accessible to the greatest number.
In particular, beyond its theatrical specificity and the incredible vitality of its nightlife,
Brussels becomes a real European center for contemporary art. It has a potential
phenomenal art, the art market is very present and the capital is full of artists,
collectors and art lovers. More and more private spaces of contemporary art were created
day. But the Belgian public is seldom aware of all this wealth. Ecolo therefore proposes
to inform the public galleries, art centers and exhibition venues.

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CULTURE AND MEDIA - p 7/29

Finally, Ecolo proposes to create a network of contemporary art scene bringing together all
headlights operators of modern and contemporary art in Brussels and Wallonie10.
Supporting audiovisual creative web-
There is great excitement in Belgium for web-creation, although the writing modes and
financing are still in their infancy. This is a real challenge and creative
economic to grasp.
Ecolo offers in this direction:
accompany and support technological advances in creating and
support the development of new audiovisual formats;
to promote the professionalization of the sector, notably through training and writing
development to digital formats;
to strengthen the capacity of the cinema and audiovisual center for project
Webcreation.

Proposal: To promote the reappropriation of public space through art
Urban art, street festivals, events such as Nuit Blanche permit
reclaiming public space through art and a strong interaction between artists and audiences.
These events also enable the development and discovery of cultural practices
emerging. They are strong indicators of the vitality of the cultural sector and neighborhoods, cities and
regions.
Ecolo offers:
to support these actors, particularly via financial assistance, and support
Development Pole Art Circus and Street;
to allow artists - Street Art from graffiti11, of urban intervention - exercise
their arts in greater freedom, in collaboration with various operators
the public space. In some neighborhoods, it will be to recognize it as being graff
part of the local heritage, to prevent some companies to market
appropriate it.
Ecolo also like to encourage the participation of urban artists to strengthen the presence of
art in public space, particularly in the context of public works (bus shelters, landscaping
on roadsides or rails, etc.)

Proposal: A country of celebration and nightlife ...
For Ecolo, you must allow the overnight culture to develop in good conditions.
Some are choosing to ban or restriction (eg by imposing restrictions or couvrefeux licenses or schedule for Horeca). Yet these measures are
counterproductive and sometimes have to firstly effect of stifling nightlife and secondly,
move the party in places out of control.
For Ecolo, this is to focus on raising public awareness and working with actors
field to enable everyone to live the party safely.
Ecolo offers:
10

Such as the BPS 22, the Museum of Photography, the Mac's - Museum of Contemporary Arts in Hainaut, the future
International Center for Art and Culture in Liege, etc.
11
We are not talking here of "tagging" that is to mark the walls of signatures to mark a territory but
although the means of artistic expression to the dissemination of a social message in the public space.

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CULTURE AND MEDIA - p 8/29

to increase awareness and prevention of the dangers of drugs, alcohol,
sexually transmitted diseases, exposure to amplified sound. This requires the
support to associations working in the field and conducting operations
through mobile outreach teams, mobilizing peer and actions
information ;
promote Quality label nights, "welfare party scene" label in Brussels and
Wallonia, with players in the Horeca and festive life.
In all major cities, Ecolo wants to be made available to the populations of
alternative venues and concert halls in which can develop any kind of broadcast
musical. Ecolo is in this sense to strengthen the development of facilities and network organizers
concerts of Wallonia-Brussels Federation contemporary music (network Club Plasma).
Finally, the increased exposure to amplified sound at concerts or parties, can cause
irreversible damage to hearing. This is a real public health problem.
Just like the adoption of measures by Flanders and following consultation with the increased
sector Ecolo proposes setting noise standards that do not damage the hearing and respect
the requirements on noise pollution. These standards should be consistent with the
Other existing legislation to avoid creating difficulties for operators. Devices
will be provided to assist operators to install suitable equipment and a
adequate soundproofing of the premises.

PRIORITY 3: PROMOTING A CULTURE FOR ALL FACTORS
OF EMPOWERMENT AND EDUCATION
12

Proposal: To guarantee everyone the right to access and participate in culture
Even today, certain categories of persons, based on their gender, age,
where they live, their origin, their occupational status or disability,
can really benefit from the effects of cultural policies. Since culture is a factor
emancipation, education and social cohesion, it is essential that all public could
exercise their "right to culture".
For Ecolo, it is first to ensure the affordability and ensuring that each and
everyone can cross the entry of all cultural venues. It is also an opportunity to strengthen
to participate effectively in cultural practices, artistic and educational.
Ecolo proposes in particular:
identify priority public cultural policies, to better
associate certain "forgotten people" (such as, in particular, the elderly or
precarious people). It should take action to strengthen
cultural democracy, to demystify the culture, art and places devoted to it. he
is also supporting devices which allow to meet these
public;
strengthen measures to facilitate access to the culture of insecure users: by
reduced entrance fees but also through the implementation of participation projects
cultural. These devices must be promoted among cultural operators and
social workers. In this sense, Ecolo will pay attention to assessing and strengthening the
"Article 27";

12

See also Chapter "Youth and Youth Welfare" for cultural youth policies.

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CULTURE AND MEDIA - p 9/29

to develop promotion campaigns with free measures
public the most precarious financially, with the field partners. In particular,
all the museums in the Wallonia-Brussels Federation are now all free
first Sunday of the month - and must remain so. But this measure is not
sufficiently well known to audiences: therefore it will promote to the public
more precarious and to ensure that it actually receives them;
strengthen the conditions for cultural mobility. The movements can be
a major obstacle, especially outside the cities. Ecolo proposes to set up
combined tickets systems (pass-culture) and to ensure better
coordination with public transport operators to ensure the accessibility of places
in transit cultural rights, including in the evening;
ensure accessibility of cultural places to the disabled and support
cultural operations to and involve people with disabilities. he
also important to support initiatives to offer sign language translation of the
shows ;
to encourage the organization of cultural events during the day in theaters,
cinemas, to facilitate the access of âgées13 people and their meetings with young people;
to fight against the digital divide, to allow any person, including
elderly, have access to information and digital cultural offer and
allow to adapt to this change sociétal14.

Proposal: Promoting cultural diversity footprint
For Ecolo, the cultural offer must value all cultures and be characterized by diversity,
the image of the territory and its peoples. The rise of racism and the persistence of certain
stereotypes show the need to strengthen the encounters, dialogue, cultural brewing,
mix. Cultural operators are key to value this diversity.
Ecolo offers:
ensure cultural diversity in the cultural landscape and support the expression of
different cultures ;
promote cultural initiatives that deconstruct stereotypes, including those
related to gender and origin. Ecolo notably supports the creation of the Museum
immigration, to promote intercultural exchanges and our differences;
encourage operators to develop arts and cultural programming that
value diversity, strengthening their missions in this respect. Ecolo intends to support
artists and associations that advocate for diversity on stage and support projects
encourage meetings between generations, social classes and cultural backgrounds;
to support initiatives aimed at engaging the public in the creation, production
artistic accomplishments: shows mixing amateur and professional shows
neighborhoods, created by and with youth clubs, local associations; doing
involve persons with disabilities ...

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CULTURE AND MEDIA - p 10/29

Proposal: To promote interdisciplinarity and cooperation between
operators
Decompartmentalize cultural sectors
Cultural operators and artists work so more and more "multi-disciplinary"
cross. To better address the public and carry out coherent approaches, they
must be able to work together.
Ecolo offers:
to strengthen support to artistic projects and multidisciplinary approaches;
encouraging decompartmentalization and cooperation between the opinions of instances for
they can work together on topics of common interest to several
sectors such as scanning or accessibility for example;
to encourage operators to develop joint projects, promote synergies
and the pooling of resources, as well as partnerships between cultural operators
(libraries, cultural items, archives, authors and collecting societies,
associations for continuing education, etc.)
Ecolo also proposes to encourage partnerships between cultural sectors (eg,
sociocultural, the arts, heritage) and other sectors (health, justice, social,
Horeca ...).
Finally, Ecolo intends to work for the realization of cultural cooperation agreement between
Flemish Community and the Federation Wallonia-Brussels, 7 December 2012. It will
encourage cooperation projects, exchanges, knowledge sharing between
operators and artists from both linguistic communities.
In Brussels, Ecolo will seek to strengthen collaboration between the Flemish and Cocof
Gemeenschapscommissie.
Strengthen cultural links - education
It is crucial to strengthen the links between culture and education. The studies show
effect that cultural practices developed in children continues into adulthood.
Ecolo offers:
to adapt the Culture School decree, adopted in 2006 in order to give a legislative follow-up to
assessments and consultations held with the sector;
beyond the financial aid granted by the decree, to better promote initiatives
Partnership between culture and school to create a leverage effect and sensitize
Teachers organize projects with cultural operators;
to study the opening of the decree for higher education and to teaching
social promotion;
strengthen support for cultural education and artistic projects and expand
privileged partnerships between cultural operators and schools;
to strengthen, as part of initial teacher education, the artistic aspects
and cultural. There is also more emphasis on teacher training
artists. Ecolo wishes to develop dialogue between teachers spaces
cultural operators and artists, like the learning platform initiated by the
RTBF;

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CULTURE AND MEDIA - p 11/29

to value the art subjects in secondary and higher education and
support the Colleges of arts15;
to boost the creation of a program of "art classes" on the model of "classes
green "days or weeks centered around visiting museums and institutions
culture (opera, theater, CINEMATEK), participation in artistic performances
(concert, rehearsal, shooting ...);
strengthen the missions of cultural operators vis-à-vis schools, such as

matinees in theaters or shows presented in or for the
schools;
strengthen the educational mission of the arts cinemas with schools,
CPAS ... (thematic screenings, professional meetings and creators, film club,
debates, etc.).

Proposal: Building on the activities of cultural centers
Cultural centers are the cornerstone of the cultural policy of proximity. Ecolo ensure
support the activities of cultural centers throughout the territory. Under the new decree
on cultural centers adopted in 2013, they now have to develop actions
cultural which rest on a "shared analysis" with other cultural operators,
cultural, social, economic territory of reference.
Ecolo wants to ensure effective implementation of the decree on the ground, respecting the fabric
associations and other cultural operators and to meet the cultural and social needs
citizens in the territory. The decree must be followed by budgetary commitments so that it can
keep his promises.
Educational tools and training shall be provided to enable the sectors
adapt to the new decree.
Ecolo also offers:
ensuring the links between artists and cultural centers, including by redefining
fields of dissemination and promotion assistance;
to support cultural centers, but also other field operators,
especially youth centers, associations of continuing education centers
expression and creativity and libraries, to strengthen cooperation and
partnerships;
to enhance the action of the cultural centers at European level, notably by supporting the
coordination of the European network (ENCC).

Proposal: To support lifelong learning
Continuing education associations play a key role in emancipation
civic and cultural and education throughout life. Governments need
recognize the importance of their action, which strengthens civil society and is the source of transformation
of society.
Ecolo offers:
to guarantee a sustainable financial support for continuing education associations in
clear legal framework. The renewed and strengthened recognition of associations is a
Ecolo priority;

15

See Chapter "Higher Education".

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CULTURE AND MEDIA - p 12/29

to ensure that a significant proportion of equities and education programs and
training directly affect people living in poverty or inactive,
in particular by promoting the sharing of experiences between associations;
promote diversity, including cultural, public continuing education;
to foster partnerships between organizations to improve heterogeneity
decompartmentalize and public priorities;
to promote training courses for the staff associations to a
better knowledge of contemporary issues (such as gender,
immigration, the rise of the extreme right, the challenges of climate change,
economic governance ...)
valuing equally active continuing education associations only
rural areas.

Proposal: To recognize and enhance the action of the centers of expression and
creativity
The center industry of expression and creativity (CEC) is composed of 158 associations
more than 500 artists-animators. It organizes workshops in hundreds of disciplines and there
welcomes over 17,000 people. It gives rise to citizen expression of projects and
socio-artistic projects. The CEC sector action takes place on a local scale and allows
outreach with citizens. In addition, most CEC orient their actions to
people who are in a more difficult situation in terms of access to culture and to the men and women
those at the margins of cultural practices.
This sector therefore directly addresses the issue of public participation in culture and
creation through a continuing education process. For Ecolo, we must recognize, value and
legitimize the practices of this sector as a full participant in the socio-cultural field
and social transformation.
Also in 2009, the centers of expression and creativity have finally been recognition
with the adoption of a decree recognizing and governing their action. For budgetary reasons,
Implementation of the decree has been postponed. This places the associations in trouble, insofar as
they have made investments to enter the criteria of the decree, without seeing their means
increased thereafter.
Ecolo proposes to mobilize the necessary resources to support the sector in order to achieve a
effective implementation of the decree on the ground, to support the transition and simplify
administrative procedures that associations must accomplish.

Proposal: To ensure the missions of libraries and Culture Points
Support libraries
Spread over the entire territory, public libraries provide services
necessary for the exercise of democracy. They help to ensure equal access to reading
and documentary sources and enhance the authors, especially the Belgian authors and
authors less known to the general public. They also allow the creation of messages through
animation around writing.
To ensure their fundamental missions, Ecolo offers:
evaluate the decree "public reading" and its implementation on the ground to
adapt; where appropriate, to simplify its application for operators and allow
a smoother transition to new missions;

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CULTURE AND MEDIA - p 13/29

to enhance the trade and the training of librarians; strengthen training
library staff in the use of new technologies, new
animation techniques and continuing education;
to centralize the payment of royalties by libraries through the power of
guardianship, Wallonia-Brussels Federation, as is the case in Flanders and in the other
European countries.
Redeploy missions "Culture Points"
Points Culture (formerly the library) are the operators for the enhancement of
cultural and heritage diversity. With new consumption patterns works
cultural (such as downloading or listening to online music), it was necessary to
give a new role to the institution whose loan was the initial mission. The Culture Points
will now conduct information missions to the cultural offer in the territory and
dialogue with the public.
Ecolo offers:
the redeployment of educational activities, including online, and strengthening
consulting and education in music;
to pay special attention to the access of everyone to services Points
Culture, including ensuring the passage of discobus in rural areas.
Promote synergies between actors to create "digital cultural spaces"
The work of cultural points must be integrated with the other cultural operators to
make publicly available a cultural offer as complete as possible. In particular, the
Libraries and Culture Points must work together in the provision of their
Online collections to develop digital cultural spaces.

PRIORITY 4: ENHANCING OUR HERITAGE AND BUILDING ON DIGITAL
Proposal: Reviving the federal scientific and cultural institutions
Scientists and federal cultural institutions are part of a perspective
scientific and cultural influence. In this regard, the identification, preservation, development
and the transmission of cultural heritage to future generations must always be
the heart of a strong protection strategy and deployment of these institutions.
Yet, despite significant challenges, governments do not ensure this
sector the support it deserves. The projects that have been put on the table, including that of
creating an art center (comprising the Royal Museums of Fine Arts, the Royal Museums of Art and
History and Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage) reflect a real no policy coherence,
do not meet the challenges of the sector.
Also, long regarded as not being subject to "market forces", the museums
increasingly subjected to increasing budgetary constraints, the growing influence of
marketing and commercialization of culture. For Ecolo, the public service mission must
remain at the forefront.
Ecolo proposes to establish a new overall strategy that combines approaches
cultural, urban and environmental. This would be developed in relationship with citizens
users of these institutions, professional teams and those involved in cultural backgrounds and
scientists.
It should enable include:

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CULTURE AND MEDIA - p 14/29

to reintegrate and redeploy all modern art collections in museums;
deploy, as soon as possible, the exposure of contemporary art collections
in existing buildings;
to develop a concerted collections digitization policy and Heritage
these institutions;
strengthen the educational and research missions of the institutions;
ensure heritage conservation missions and study of the Royal Institute of
artistic heritage.
Ecolo also proposes that Parliament is associated with reflection, when they draw
institutions of their multiannual management plans and programming that define
objectives, partnerships, public service missions ...

Proposal: To conserve and enhance the archives
Archives are an essential resource to the democratic functioning, rule of law and
working memory. Public archives, because they provide access to information
public, ensuring transparency of political decisions. Now they face
several challenges: the breakdown of responsibilities between the different levels of authority,
digital revolution and the lack of means.
To meet this challenge, Ecolo proposes the establishment of a coordinated policy between
various levels of government in safeguarding public archives, through the
establishing a federal structure for the management of the common heritage. This policy should aim
the establishment of synergies between the various federal archives and entities
federated to gain in efficiency and effectiveness, both ways on projects
common. It also aims to strengthen collaborations with researchers and policy
scientific.

Proposal: Establish a heritage digitization policy
Ecolo wants to encourage public institutions (museums, libraries, archives center, institutes
Heritage), private actors and creators to join for scanning and recovery
Heritage, for the implementation of a concerted policy. The goal is to line
all of our heritage and to ensure democratic access to all.
For Ecolo, works in the public domain must be promoted and preserved but
also protected against all attempts at privatization.
Ecolo offers:
an update on the results of PIP's plane (preservation plan and operating
Heritage), implemented in 2007 by the Wallonia-Brussels Federation and consider
future prospects ;
to integrate the European and international initiatives defining archival standards
and digitization of cultural heritage;
to join European projects to identify orphan works (project
ARROW) or books available in electronic reissue (Replay) ...
to work for the establishment of a common digital portal for all centers
archives, as public institutions as private archives. This will
then put it in connection with the access portal for heritages of digitized
Wallonia-Brussels Federation.

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CULTURE AND MEDIA - p 15/29

Proposal: Encourage the development of the book
Regulate the price of paper books and support libraries
Ecolo proposes the adoption of legislation similar to the French law (Lang law). This will take a
dual purpose. First, ensure diversity of supply. On the other hand, the balance ratio
Economic forces between large retailers and small stores.
In fact, bookstores can not afford to sell at prices bestseller "broken" as
This is the case in major retailers. Now, it is selling these high-circulation books that their
can cover the risks taken when they offer less promising works
economically.
Ecolo proposes to regulate the price of paper books by working on limiting decreases
sales prices of 10% for all books and 15% for books for education,
training, research or bibliothèques16.
Added to this is that the books sold in Belgium remain more expensive than in France (sometimes up
10% more expensive), this because the old system of "tabelle17" He must be stopped.
Encourage the development of digital books
Ecolo offers:
to support the design, production and the provision of public by any means
broadcast text content, digital audio and video;
to mobilize resources to support innovative digital projects, resorting to
the most advanced technologies;
supporting publishers in publishing digital books;
to support the sector booksellers compete multinationals in
encouraging the development of offers combining digital books and paper books;
to set up training incentives, research and
Development on the scan procedures;
Support Interprofessional coordination for all to work together
the players in the book chain.
Ecolo also proposes to provide an identical VAT rate for paper and digital books.
This legislation must be brought to the level of the European Union.
Support the authors
This is to support the authors and new talents, allowing them to create to help via
development and writing.
Save the book heritage
Ecolo proposes to set up a digitization plan books and comics boards in
involving the rights holders (authors, editors ...), the National Library of Belgium, the
institutions concerned (eg the Centre of Comic Strip) and public authorities.
The objective will be to ensure the preservation and access to published literary heritage Federation
Wallonie-Bruxelles18.

16

This sale price reduction limitation would no longer apply after a certain period, for example when the
book is published in more than two years and that its latest supply was more than six months.
17
This is due to a recovery by some French actors of the book of the system of tabelle. This prevents even
Belgian booksellers to source directly from publishers; forcing them to use intermediaries and
consequently have to undergo a price increase.
18
Also the proposal: "Leave room for creation."

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CULTURE AND MEDIA - p 16/29

PRIORITY 5: CHANGE POLICIES AND PRACTICES REVIEW SUPPORTS
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE TO CULTURE

Proposal: Strengthen cultural governance
The consistency of public support to culture and cultural governance are, Ecolo, the
top priorities. If several initiatives have been taken in favor of better
transparency, cases of conflicts of interest, cronyism, embezzlement of the object of some
subsidies, lack of objectivity ... decisions are still to be deplored.
Ecolo seeking to engage in an ambitious action plan to ensure the governance and
transparency in all cultural policy making and in the granting of subsidies. It is
From new political practices it be possible to breathe new life and
new impetus to cultural policies.
Ecolo proposes in particular:
adopted a decree "cultural governance" determining common rules to
all cultural sectors. These concern: transparency of process
decision, the systematization of decisions objectification, greater advertising
calls for recognition and project calls for public engagement
leaders of cultural operators and the development of evaluation criteria;
ensure the transparency and objectivity of decisions on grants
"Optional" or exceptional, especially those of the National Lottery and aids
equipment;
develop clear and objective criteria in the case of calls for proposals for cultural projects
punctual such as contests, art events and various celebrations. This
will prevent dusting or political control and ensure gender
all operators;
to enhance transparency in the management of public procurement and calls for proposals;
ensure independence vis-à-vis public associations and political powers and
implement the commitments of the voluntary charter;
strengthen the support of associations and operators by the administration of
Culture and simplify administrative procedures that they must accomplish.

Proposal: Ensure participation and transparency in policy
Cultural
Reforming bodies of opinion
In Wallonia-Brussels, believes thirty bodies (commissions and advisory councils)
representing all sectors involved in the development and implementation of policies
cultural. They challenge opinions on future legislation and the policies or the
distribution of subsidies between industry players. They play a fundamental role in
the exercise of a democratic public action.
Ecolo proposes to assess the functioning opinions of instances and gather to exchange
on best practices.
Ecolo also offers:
develop new composition rules of the view instances to ensure
representation of cultural diversity: clearly defining conflicts of interest, strengthen
parity and diversity in the bodies and limit cumulative mandates;

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CULTURE AND MEDIA - p 17/29

to harmonize procedures of decisions and actions;
to ensure, in each sector, the existence of specific criteria to accompany
bodies in their opinion work.
Ensure greater transparency in the management of cultural operators
Ecolo offers:
ensure the democratic functioning of cultural operators: respect for
representation of associations (cultural Covenant), transparency modes
operation, limiting the possibilities of absolute majority and conflicts of interest ...;
to develop common management tools (particularly in accounting) for
facilitate the work of the directors.
Create a one-stop information and access to culture
Ecolo proposes to create, within the Administration of Culture of the Federation Wallonia-Brussels
one-stop cultural information. It will provide artists, creators and actors
cultural all the information necessary for the exercise of their professional activity. It will play a
role of objective referent on existing regulations, support measures in each
sector, the functioning of institutions and will provide administrative and legal advice
the introduction of folders.
Ecolo also proposes to make a cadastre of all the facilities available for
enhance access for all artists and cultural actors. The one-stop information will
to provide all relevant information such as the terms of access to places, rates,
accessibility and availability of time criteria. Ecolo also hope that consideration be
feasibility of an inventory of online booking system to ensure equal access for all
operators.

Proposal: To promote a better allocation of public subsidies for
successful real territorial coverage
Culture is a pillar of sustainable social and economic development and an asset for
the attractiveness of an area. Today, cultural budgets are very unevenly distributed across
living areas, cities and structures, often based on history or political support,
without a coherent action will actually be built. If he is not about to everywhere
all, it must nevertheless that cultural projects are ambitious and complementary, so that
everyone can play a role and flourish there.
Ecolo want to rethink public support to culture so that it meets the
needs and cultural practices in the field. For this, it is able to rebalance
resource allocation based on the territorial network.
Ecolo therefore proposes:
evaluate existing tools such as Focus on the cultural development and territorial
give them a purpose and specific objectives;
to make transparent the data on public support to culture in all
territories ;
to study the offer, needs and cultural practices in the territory, basing these
Studies not on constituencies but on living areas;
on the basis of these observations, to promote synergies and the pooling of resources
government, to encourage the development of joint cultural projects

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CULTURE AND MEDIA - p 18/29

develop cultural plans corresponding to the territories in connection with the centers
culturels19.
For Ecolo, off events such as the European capitals of culture or
cultural metropolises should be participatory events, lasting in time and in the
choice of means (energy, materials ...). They must have rewarding benefits across
the Federation Wallonia-Brussels or Belgium. Events like Mons 2015
must produce lasting effects for cultural life and economic redeployment of all
a region and benefit all sectors and partner cities.

Proposal: Ensuring cultural exception
At European and international level, the principle of the cultural exception involves exclude
culture and audiovisual policy of free trade and thus allow states to continue
to undertake proactive policies to support these sectors (financial support, quota
distribution, support to small producers, etc.).
The cultural exception is a central element of cultural diversity and freedom of expression.
On the one hand, it opens to the world and provides access to different views. Moreover, it
capable of setting limits to the influence of the market on culture.
Ecolo offers:
continue to specifically exclude the culture of any trade agreement that the Union
EU may enter into with its partners and in particular with the United States without
prejudice to the other limitations that environmentalists intend to ask for such negotiations
accords20;
to include digital platforms in the field of the cultural exception;
at European level, to maintain the principle of "territoriality aid" approach
audiovisual, to enable States to conduct film support policies and
audiovisual creation.

Proposal: To support cultural and creative industries
The cultural and creative industries have taken in recent years, an important first
Plan in the economy. They are mainly service industries, often based on
new technologies, falling production activities and cultural exchanges subject to
rules of commodification. Creative design industry, architecture, arts
plastics, arts, music, etc. are now increasingly sought after by
companies that are constantly seeking new innovation niches.
This is an extremely promising sector, which must also support. To do this, Ecolo offers:
ensure better coordination between the policies of different levels
power;
evaluating the investment fund for cultural enterprises (St'Art) to find
the type of business and non-profit organization benefiting from them; to measure its impact on the sector and
on employment; and consider its development.
to create meeting spaces between artists, creators, companies and financiers.
Whether to rejoice at the enthusiasm of the corporate world for creativity, intends Ecolo
nevertheless remain vigilant so that the result is not contrary to that intended. Indeed, if the

20
See Chapter "International".

Ecolo program 2014 - Youth Book, Education and Culture - Chapter CULTURE AND MEDIA - p 19/29

World production companies can open new perspectives for art and artists,
it can also lead to an impoverishment of creativity led to an "industry of beauty"
sometimes very formatted.

Proposal: Reforming the Tax Shelter System
One of the most important support systems in the financing of audiovisual creation is
the Tax Shelter. This is a tax incentive that allows companies that invest in
audiovisual production to obtain in exchange a tax exemption and shall receive
yield. The system is vital for the audiovisual sector: it has helped increase the number of
films produced in Belgium and led to the creation of many jobs in sectors
techniques and the achievement of production.

Nevertheless, deviations were noted: a "speculative" has outbid establishment

people with visible disabilities, they are downright excluded écrans23. A barometer
the young people in the media image was also conducted, which shows that overall, it

Diversity is even less present in the press, that gives voice to primarily
white men in active age groups, usually frames or sports or Experts

the functioning of local democracy has been improved: control of communications
MPPs, as well as mayors and aldermen to approach
elections, possibility of entrusting the presidency of the communal council to a lay
member of the College, strengthening the rights of local councilors, etc. ;
Pluralism has been strengthened in communal newspapers: openness to all
political groups in Brussels; right to expression of all political
in case of political expression in Wallonia and in Brussels, if the College will present its
achievements;
Referendum will now also possible at regional level;
intercommunal beyond the boundaries of a region, such as Tecteo, or Sibelga
Vivaqua, exited the no man's land in which they were, for now
subject to legislation and regional guardianship;
the financing of political parties has been made more transparent.
Moreover, under pressure from environmentalists, the sixth state reform has helped improve
readability of electoral ballots:
simultaneous applications on electoral lists for terms of levels
different power between which there is a legal conflict are now prohibited;
an attorney will resign from office if elected to another term legally
incompatible with its current mandate;
the duration of the regional and federal legislatures coincide (5 years for all).
Significant progress has been made thanks to the action of Ecolo in the space of five years. We must continue
working systematically to harmonize upwards regional and federal legislation
on democracy and ethics. The change in practice must be anchored in mentalities
and be deepened in order to develop participation, modernize the electoral system,
renew representative democracy and reform political practices.

The political horizon Ecolo on democracy and political ethics
Beyond its priorities for ecological transition and solidarity, also carries Ecolo
since its inception a strong will to make political and otherwise renew the
democracy. In the eyes of Ecolo, it is clear from the beginning that can lead to breaks
necessary and consider the lasting implications of policy choices by changing the
way of doing politics, involving citizens, preventing abuse
and other hobbies rights, organizing pluralistic institutions, combating inequalities and
extremism, governing more transparent way, considering the political ethics
as a cardinal virtue. In line with its proposals for the society and institutions,
Ecolo has also given very strict ethical rules, particularly for limiting
compensation and retrocession of decumulation of mandates, member participation and
internal control, etc.

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter DEMOCRACY AND ETHICS POLICY - p 2/18

Meet the great democratic challenges
As indicated above, there remains important work to expand and grow. Restoring confidence
of citizens in the state and make it more effective, fairer and more
requires the pursuit of sustainable measures to address the democratic stall
growing, poor management of public resources, modernization of public services,
the equality guarantees and equity to be made to citizens, modernizing and
renewal of political practices. Ecolo intends to give every citizen
a central actor in the role of life in society.
At the same time, the democratic deficit of the European institutions must also be
apprehended. European integration and the ambitions that we carry for Europe
require the implementation of significant reforms of the functioning of the institutions as
as européennes1 policies.

The lines of Ecolo forces of democracy and political ethics are
the following :
Increase participation
Modernizing the Electoral System
Renew representative democracy
Reform political practices

Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: DEVELOP PARTICIPATION
The development of participation, for the opening of public space to the greatest number,
is essential in the reconquest of the democratic system by citizens.
Give everyone the opportunity to participate fully in the political decision is to be taken
seriously the democratic ideal. The criteria for a "reasonable" argument can never be
sliced ​​in advance: everyone can therefore bring their own ingredients. This will
also based on a broader conviction: if the extension of the deliberative process
upstream of the decision increases the legitimacy of the decision, this is also increased legitimacy
likely to enhance the quality and effectiveness of public policies.
Ecolo also wants to encourage a greater culture of consultation within the
population and communal and regional public authorities. This also requires better
access to information and improved participation tools so that citizens
can give their opinion and / or participate in the development of a decision knowingly.
For Ecolo, so it is necessary to complement representative democracy, based on
Designation of elected representatives, by population participation mechanisms through which
it can appropriate the decision process.

Proposal: Create a citizen's right of legislative initiative
With the prospect of a modernization of the right of petition, Ecolo supports the creation of a
citizen's right of legislative initiative. This right is the obligation for the federal Parliament, a
Community or regional Parliament to include in its agenda and to consider any proposal

1

For more information on the proposed Ecolo on this, see Chapter "Europe".

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter DEMOCRACY AND ETHICS POLICY - p 3/18

law, decree or ordinance, or any proposed resolution, supported by 1% of the body
correspondant2 election. The proposals contradict human rights, requiring
Special parliamentary majority or in tax matters would be excluded from this right of initiative.

Proposal: Sit and amplify the role of consultations populaires3
Ecolo wants to expand the use of the popular consultation on the initiative of public authorities or
a segment of the population.
Acquired obtained by ecologists as part of the VI State Reform, it will be possible soon
July 2014 a Region of organizing referendums on matters of interest
exclusively regional, both at the initiative of citizens than to that of Parliament. Ecolo agrees to
implement this reform as soon as the next Parliament through the adoption of a decree /
organique4 prescription.
Popular consultations are already available locally. Ecolo wishes
also improve the existing legislative framework in the Brussels-Capital Region, drawing on
improvements adopted in the Walloon Code of Local Democracy, led Ecolo
(including information to refine the rules and procedures control mechanisms).

Proposal: To organize referendums decision brought to all
levels of power
Besides the ability to organize popular consultations, proposes the establishment of the Ecolo
legislative referendum at the federal, community and regional and local levels. On the
local and regional level, it is to make it possible, next to the popular consultation, organization
referendums on matters of municipal interest, provincial or regional. At the federal level,
This is especially to allow the holding of a referendum prior to ratification
international treaties that involve a transfer of sovereignty, accompanied by process
comprehensive information on the impact of these treaties.
The organization of these referendums should naturally be surrounded by terms and conditions.
No referendum could be organized on such proposals contradict
human rights - or with international conventions relating thereto - requiring a majority
or special taxation. Similarly, any referendum must of course be accompanied by a
process fair and public debate.

2
Since 1 April 2012, such a procedure exists at European level, but less automatically. Thus, a
million EU citizens from at least seven member states of the European Union may apply to the
European Commission to take action and introduce a legislative initiative, a legislative proposal, in a specific field.
The Commission may refuse to follow a citizens' initiative but must then explain. If she makes a proposal,
it then follows the ordinary legislative procedure: it is the European Parliament and the EU Council (representing the
Member States) to decide.
3
Referendum is a voting mechanism by which the public is invited to express its preference between
two or more possible decisions on a given subject. It differs in that referendum the opinion expressed by the
population is not legally binding for the Parliament or the Government, but this expression is however
politically decisive. The referendum is a voting mechanism by which the population indicates the legislature and / or
the government in what direction he must decide. It usually comes down to answer "yes" or "no" to a
issue the statement is simplified to the maximum. In case of a referendum, the population imposes its choice, which must
must be put into practice by the authorities. The consultation or public inquiry is an approach to
involve the population in a public decision-making by asking him his opinion in the framework of projects. She is not
necessarily limited in the possible answers.
4
In order to anticipate this issue, Ecolo has already filed such a proposal in 2009 (Doc. 33 SE, 2009, the Walloon Parliament).

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter DEMOCRACY AND ETHICS POLICY - p 4/18

Proposal: To provide citizens with access to information5
The development of citizen participation based on a pre-requisite, namely that each and
everyone has free access to public decisions. In other words, to be able to
participate in public decision-making, we need to have the information. The right to consult
administrative acts and, in particular, acts preparatory to the final decision of the authority
Public well be enshrined in the Constitution (Article 32) or in law instruments
international or European (Aarhus Convention), it remains subject to difficulties and
harassment in practice and the various levels of pouvoir6.
Consequently, Ecolo offers systematize active advertising not only to acts
administrative, but also advice and preparatory acts in public decisions (opinion of
Etat7 Council and other consultative bodies, legal opinions sought from firms
of avocats8, studies and research commissioned from universities or research center) and
develop media communication in this regard. Thus, by way of illustration projects
legislation or regulations of federal, community or regional and
all opinions thereto, will be made available, from the sending to the State Council
to notice.
Ecolo also advocates the establishment or development of tools and campaigns
information to the citizens.

Proposal: Extend and support the development of participatory tools
The wide opening of the deliberative process to the citizens and the implementation
a culture of participation call multiple participatory tools that can be, according
cases, one-time or recurring, of greater or lesser extent. It is well to open
new forms of representation, passing of knowledge from various field experiences,
scientific expertise and political representation classic.
In this context, Ecolo means:
encourage the use of participatory budgeting at the local level, in the wake of
advanced Local democracy and décentralisation9 Code;
more accessible and visible public inquiries on the environment or
land use (public meetings outside of working hours Content
with understandable for each survey, available both in print and on the support
electronic …) ;
support local participation practices (neighborhood committees, associations
users ...), acting both in terms of support for recognition;
promote the implementation, including the procedures already mentioned, means
necessary for the effective participation of citizens: transparency and predictability
procedures, transparency of documents, conducting a participatory process
third independent reasons for acts of the administration.

5

This proposal relates to the active advertising, that is to say, a right of access to particular information requested by the
citizen. In our proposals on passive publicity (information that governments publish and automatically
all), see Chapter "Public Service, Governance and Public Service".
6
See also Chapter "Public Service, Governance and Public Service" and "Technologies
information and communication ".
7
We filed a bill in this regard: Proposal to amend the laws on the Council of State, coordinated
January 12, 1973, to the publication of the opinion of the legislative section. (Doc 53K2447001 Room)
8
We filed a bill in this regard: Proposed law amending, as regards the secret
professional, the Act of 11 April 1994 on the disclosure of government. (Doc 53K2764001 Room)
9
Spurred environmentalists, the legislation explicitly recognizes the municipal council the opportunity to decide
to allocate part of the municipal budget, called participatory budget, for projects from neighborhood committees or
citizens' associations (CDLD. - Art L1321-3)

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter DEMOCRACY AND ETHICS POLICY - p 5/18

Specifically, Ecolo calls to develop the citizen-not-s conferences or panels
Deliberative, such as citizens' panels-users to evaluate certain publiques10 policies,
roundtables bringing together experts and citoyens11 or the G100012. Namely the instruction
files by a group of people selected at random as part of an improvement of the debate
public (especially regarding environmental issues, societal debates or
other long term issues).
Finally, Ecolo proposes to create a structured / institutionalized framework to think about
new forms of democracy. This would for example to create a new commission
(extra) parliamentarian, composed partly of parliamentarians and of citizens, whose
main mission is to reflect, in coordination with experts, researchers and
actors on the ground, on new forms of democracy. Citizens would be drawn and
renewed periodically.

Proposal: Renew the advisory function
A large number of advisory councils in Belgium to advise the
governors of different levels of power, in a series of sectoral policies. Their opinions
must be taken into account, their rules must be clear to their members and their
operation should escape the instrumentalization particratiques. For these purposes, offers Eco
especially whenever necessary to simplify operation, widening their membership,
to strengthen their autonomy and their ability to think systematize advertising advice,
cap the operating expenses and to limit the term of office in time and
rollups.
Ecolo also intends to strengthen and structure the youth consultation and places
jeunesse13.

Proposal: Strengthen Cultural Pact
Ecolo proposes to update and strengthen the action of culturel14 Covenant in order to expand
pluralism culturelles15 institutions:
diversify the composition of their organs, with the involvement of user groups and
Professional-le-s of Culture alongside the art representative of political parties
democratic where this is not yet the case;
subordinating public financing to conditions of participation and equal
users: information available to cultural operators, protection categories
enrolling in any of the philosophical tendencies / recognized political ...;
extend its scope, including in child sectors, aid to
youth … ;
strengthening the Permanent National Commission of the Cultural Covenant in its power to
monitoring and review by financing information regarding its action.

10
For example, evaluating the satisfaction of users of public transport in a more citizen-panel
that only by a questionnaire.
11
For example, the round table organized in the province of Luxembourg on the fight against poverty collecting
people out of institutionalized circuits and public and associative actors.
12
Next to the G1000, other initiatives exist. For example, in Canada a deliberative citizen panel and is consulted on
different folders before they are submitted to a referendum. The proceedings of this panel are broadcast on
TV and are fully funded by the state (see the work of D. Weinstock).
13
See Chapter "Youth and Youth Welfare" for the development of this proposal.
14
The Law on Cultural Pact provides for proportional representation of all democratic political parties in
cultural bodies managed by the public service.
15
We also invite you to read the proposals on governance in the culture sector in the
Chapter "Culture and media".

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter DEMOCRACY AND ETHICS POLICY - p 6/18

Furthermore, Ecolo proposes to modernize the law of the Cultural Pact of 1973 to clarify the
procédure16. It should notably provide for a notice of assignment to the Commission
Cultural Pact, beside his complaints mission.

PRIORITY 2: THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM UPGRADE
Elections naturally retain a central role in the democratic process and
class arbitration within the company, through the appointment of representatives and
authorized representatives for this purpose. It is therefore important that the electors can
take full ownership of this democratic time, so that the orientations expressed by their
votes are properly taken into account and met by public policies that are
then implemented.
For Ecolo, it is therefore appropriate to modernize the electoral system, improving readability
election issues.

Proposal: Extend the right to vote and stand
If the vote does not epitomizes democratic life, it is the expression most
manifesto of equal rights enjoyed by citizens. In this context, supports the Ecolo
maintaining the obligation to vote.
Ecolo also proposes expanding the right to vote at all levels of power Other17
for foreign nationals es national residing in Belgium for five years. Ecolo
also advocates the granting to the same people the right to be elected at the local level,
community / regional and European level.
Moreover, the period during which non-Belgians can register on the list of electors is
short. Ecolo therefore proposes to allow registration on the voters' list at any time,
a permanent opening of registration. This inclusion in the list of voters should
définitive18 be.
Registration of foreigners on the lists of electors is also a democratic issue
and importantly citizenship. Ecolo has a standardization of procedures to exercise its
voting between European foreigners and non-européens19.
Ecolo also wants a thorough assessment of the participation of European foreign
and non-European to the latest municipal elections, to improve campaigns
awareness and information about them. In a clear information concern the same and
transparent regions (not only common) should be responsible for
information and awareness campaigns, ensuring the relay via the municipalities and
associations20.

16
Currently, the deadline to appeal before the State Council shall be suspended for 90 days to allow the
Cultural Pact Commission to issue an opinion. This period is too short for the Commission. It would therefore lengthen
Complaint processing times and provide a period during which an appeal may be lodged.
17
Non-European foreigners residing in Belgium for five years have the right to vote and stand in elections
communal. The same goes for European nationals in local and European unconditional
residence. Ecolo intends to maintain these provisions.
18
For Ecolo, registering on the electoral roll is a democratic, civic approach that involves voting
and the obligation to vote, it is Belgian or foreign. Thus, once on a list, a voter abroad are
remain registered in all municipalities of the Kingdom as long as he resides in Belgium.
19
Indeed, for example, non-European foreigners must commit to honor and respect the writing
Constitution and Belgian laws. Obligation is not imposed on European foreigners. More specifically, Ecolo
wants to standardize the different existing systems in order to vote in local, that is European or
no.
20
It seems indeed a responsibility of the Regions in the information and awareness on the right to vote
foreigners in local elections is a guarantee of greater equity for all candidates. Indeed, when

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter DEMOCRACY AND ETHICS POLICY - p 7/18

In the wake of the measures taken under the sixth state reform to
facilitate voting by Belgians residing étranger21, Ecolo supports the extension of voting rights
Belgians living abroad to community / regional elections.
Ecolo also supports lowering the granting of voting rights to 16 years.
Finally, Ecolo wants the right to vote is effectively exercised by the categories of persons
who are today still sometimes de facto excluded. This particular requires a
logistical support for people with physical disabilities; preservation and
the implementation of their rights to the elderly, people with intellectual disabilities; creation
a reference address - or an "electoral" home - for people without a roof;
the opening of polling stations in nursing homes or institutions for persons
handicapées22; etc.

Proposal: Improve readability election issues
The practice of law is truncated when it becomes impossible for citizens to locate the link between its
vote and the result of the vote: the elected candidates do not sit, unelected candidates sit ...
The readability of electoral votes is improved following the sixth state reform. Thus, in
the impulse environmentalists, or a candidate for election can not be candidate
simultaneously on multiple electoral lists for different power levels and mandates
between which there is a legal conflict (eg, on a list for elections
regional and on a list for federal elections). Furthermore, the candidate who is an agent
when it is a candidate to the voter and who is elected for another term legally
incompatible with the mandate he already exercises must automatically resign.
Ecolo wants to continue improving the readability of the electoral ballot and make the exercise of
voting more transparent. To this end, Ecolo offers:
transfuges23 enhance deterrence by attaching two effects of right:
-

the loss of all executive orders or exercised by the derivatives / agent
e-concerned because its original mandate, as the progress made in
the Walloon Code of local democracy before the 2012-2018 municipal legislature;

-

the ineligibility of the same or any agent or derivative as executive mandate
long as his (or her) office (s) elective (s) being when transferred has
(have) not been terminated;

encourage the disclosure of any pre-election agreements at the municipal level,
for a rule similar to the apparentement24 between the lists before the elections,
submit an official statement publicly expressing their willingness to be
together a majority.

the town itself has to perform this role information, this often comes back to the mayor or alderman in charge,
who is himself a candidate in local elections.
21
By providing attachment to a common objective criteria for registration as well as the sustainability of registration
as a voter or improving the procedures for voting and counting votes.
22
Polling stations experiments located in nursing homes or institutions for disabled people
proved effective. These polling stations - open to all voters of the district, like any other polling station allows residents to get into these places and to meet residents. They themselves can exercise their right to vote without having to give proxy. The organization of these polling stations must
obviously respect the same democratic control rules as any other polling station.
23
An attorney who resigns from his political group with which he had presented to the voter to sit in another
political group or to sit as an independent.
24
The relatedness is a corrective mechanism for the allocation of seats in Due election allows lists
candidates to add the voice they have gathered in several constituencies, for example, within the same
province for regional elections in Wallonia. The current communal voting system favors large lists. By
analogy, a kinship between the lists seamlessly assume that their pre-election agreement would allow them to
benefit from the same advantage by adding the voice they have collected for the allocation of seats (which would
then divided them according to their respective voice).

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter DEMOCRACY AND ETHICS POLICY - p 8/18

Proposal: To ensure the transparency and fairness of the vote
Ecolo believes that in the current state of technology, only the vote on paper ballot, with
manual count by the citizens appointed for this purpose, is likely to
ensure transparency and democratic control of the election. Ecolo therefore requests the maintenance -
or recovery - paper vote. Moreover, no further change of the voting system or
counting - for example, with paper ballot counting by optical scanning - no
could be adopted without the guarantee of democratic control that also allows that
papier25 vote. The Wallonia and Brussels Parliaments have taken this direction. The federal government owes them
suit.
Ecolo also considers it necessary to ensure better democratic control of operations
transfer of ballot boxes from polling stations to the counting station.
Moreover, despite progress, the campaign continues to result in
some adverse spillovers to the fairness of the vote. Ecolo intends to consolidate
legislation on election expenses and party funding:
Reduce the volume of authorized election expenses - especially in lists
and candidates are, so that the overall volume of election expenses tend to be closer
the amounts granted to the parties in terms of public funding;
Entrust the control of election expenditure to an independent commission which, if
appropriate, will also deliver a detailed opinion upstream;
create a possibility of judicial appeal or recourse to a third body
(including, for example, the Court of Auditors) downstream spending.
Finally, Ecolo called to clarify the rules on public and private election signs:
Organize public electoral display by municipalities in protected panels;
Include the obligation to seek the prior written consent of an individual - who keeps a
copy - for a private outdoor advertising (private land, garden);
4m establish a limit for election posters of the same party in a
trade (as for public display on communal panels);
Create a Walloon independent judicial body and politicize the proceedings
Brussels judicial, which deals with complaints from individuals and candidates before,
during and after the election campaign.

Proposal: Strengthen parity in parliaments and in the
Governments and Colleges
The parity in parliaments is not yet reached, and the governments and bodies
Executives generally have a low female presence.
Several measures have already helped to strengthen a more balanced representation of women
and men in our meetings. Ecolo has implemented for its own electoral roll
the system of the "zipper" that is to say, the alternation between candidates (and staff
alternates) on all of the list, as of 2006.
At the municipal level, all the lists will be subject to the pull rule from 2018 to
the level of regional ballots, electoral lists must currently meet a parity
equality among all candidates and the first two candidates can not be the same
sex. It is therefore not of the pull tab on the entire list. To strengthen parity, Ecolo

25

For Ecolo, electronic voting with ticketing (a paper ticket given to the voter after the vote achieved so
then scanned and e) does not guarantee a democratic control as the paper vote.

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter DEMOCRACY AND ETHICS POLICY - p 9/18

proposes that the "zipper" is also established on all the lists submitted for election
federal, regional and European.
Finally, Ecolo proposes that governments, municipal and provincial colleges and other
executive bodies have at least one third of members of each sex.

Proposal: Ensuring pluralism in democratic institutions
Democratic control of public management sits the legitimacy of public action and
the democratic opposition has a considerable responsibility in this regard. However, it must
find that the electoral system has a number of mechanisms that alter the
proportionality of representation and strengthen the hegemony without legitimate grounds of force
dominant policy.
Ecolo proposes to ensure the proportionality of representation electoral system:
reviewing the size of small electoral districts to elect at least 5
representatives in each district;
standardizing the access threshold for the matching 5% in regional elections and
Provincial;
by reducing the eligibility threshold of 5% provided for federal and regional elections;
by calculating the devolution of indirect mandates among the groups represented in
Meeting on the basis of votes cast and not on the basis of allocated seats to
to avoid the weakening of proportional representation;
using a more proportional key (abandonment of the Imperiali key) in elections
communal, like the key already applicable for other elections;
ensuring, beyond proportional representation, minimal representation
Derived entities within the management bodies (public enterprises, Organizations
Public Interest (OIP), non-profit, inter ...), as has been established in Wallonia
the boards of independent public corporations, non-profit and inter.

Proposal: To continue the democratic struggle against the draconian parties
The fight against the draconian parties primarily depends on the quality of public policies and
the democratic debate of ideas and pedagogy. Such an approach may, however, be
Short-term insufficient.
Also, Ecolo supports the formulation against draconian parties, a general principle
Constitutional lapse of derivative democratic rights (public funding and grants
parliamentarians, representation derived entities management bodies, access to
newsletters and electoral platforms) and the extension of this principle in respect of any
liberticide organization (grant aid to the press ...).
In this context, the Constitutional Court holds a monopoly on judgment of the compatibility
the actions and the program of a party or an organization with rights and freedoms
fundamentals.

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter DEMOCRACY AND ETHICS POLICY - p 10/18

PRIORITY 3: RENEW DEMOCRACY REPRESENTATIVE
Proposal: Improve parliamentary democracy
The relationship between the legislative and executive powers remain deeply unequal, the
Government Moreover, the different levels of power, the center of the political system, so
that the parliament just to assume its role of control and initiative. This situation is not without
induce many pitfalls for the quality of democracy and deliberative process.
Ecolo offers:
strengthen the Parliament's proposal to be able facilitating the possibility to submit
Parliamentary legislative proposals with the opinion of the State Council;
strengthen parliament's oversight capacity in respect of the government:
-

organizing publicity opinions that are rendered to the Government (unpublished opinion
State Council, assessing the Court of Auditors, legal advice and review
university ...) 26;

-

improving monitoring of the activities of public interest organizations (OIP);

-

modernizing the rules of public accounting;

-

offering access to the parliamentary groups in monitoring the implementation of appropriations
budget.

Moreover, monitoring devices for international policy by Parliament
Federal has been reinforced by a triple way: provision of human resources of Parliament
to consider proposals for EU directives or international treaties;
regular presentation by members of the Government policy notes (upstream) and
Evaluation ratings (downstream) on files whose decision-making bodies of succession
European and international; establishment of a standing committee of the political control
foreign. These devices must nevertheless be développés27 and have also meaningful if
elected officials are present in the committee, which is not necessarily the case today.
Ecolo also proposes to link the remuneration of all parliamentarians in their work
Committee on the terms in force at PW, the PRB and PFWB
Following the sixth state reform, under pressure from environmentalists, the role of the federal Parliament also
was strengthened through the provision of the possibility of drafting an initiative introductory report to a
social debate on the one hand, the organization of the hearing of Ministers after taking office,
to present their vision of the challenges in their skills and the manner in which they
plan to tackle it on the other. Ecolo proposes to generalize these practices to all
Parliaments and expand the hearings to potential conflicts of interest, like the hearings of
Commissioners by the European Parliament.
Ecolo wants to strengthen parliamentary debates, especially when the issue occurs
organizing international cultural and sporting events in countries that do not respect
not human rights. It happens too often in fact that ministers assume a position
behalf of Belgium on the international scene which has been the subject of any prior debate
the speaker of parliament.

26

27
Ecolo also proposes to strengthen the democratic control before deciding to send a possible mission
military abroad. For more information about the proposal, please consult Chapter
" International ".

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter DEMOCRACY AND ETHICS POLICY - p 11/18

Ecolo also proposes to improve publicity and openness of parliamentary work
ensuring the dissemination of the debate via the Internet and experiencing their television, as well as
improving usability and functionality of parliamentary websites.
Finally, Ecolo intends to systematize the possibility for Parliament to make recommendations
the government on the drafting of management contracts by the government and by
the dérivées28 entities.

Proposal: Improve the advertising executive jobs
Spurred environmentalists, agendas and notices of Ministers Councils
federal government are published and sent to federal parliamentarians every week. It
The same with regard to the Consultation Committee.
Ecolo provides that decisions of the public utility company boards
autonomous public, IOPs and parastatals which directly concern
citizens should be published in a legible and understandable manner by each and everyone.
Ecolo finally proposes, when this is not the case, that the agendas of meetings and notifications
executive federated entities are made public, and that the agendas and meetings procèsverbaux communal colleges and boards of directors
and other inter-derived entities are made accessible to local councilors.

Proposal: Strengthening local democracy
During the previous legislature, Ecolo has enabled major advances to strengthen and
dust of local democracy and the organization of local authorities. It should continue
work.
Ecolo wants to review the respective roles of the municipal council and the municipal college, to assign
college - elected team - skills under the daily management and turn it
Council meeting a real debate, to which the college is fully responsible.
Since 2012, at the instigation of environmentalists, the City Council can be chaired by one or
municipal councilor chosen within it, outside of college members. Ecolo offers
must grant the presidency of the communal council to or counselor who is not
member of the College or prevented mayor.
Meanwhile, Ecolo proposes to withdraw any jurisdictional competence to advice and
provincial colleges, including on election disputes.
The rights of councilors and municipal councilors (access and cost of documents, deadlines
convocations of various bodies, right to question or challenge the college capacity
paralocales control entities) are still insufficient and must be strengthened.
Ecolo believes also essential that communications are representatives of local executive
limited and controlled - as is the case at the level of Governments.
Ecolo also offers a balanced gender representation in the Municipal College and
Provincial via the introduction of a quota of one third of the members of different sex College.
Meanwhile, in the Brussels region, the president of the CPAS should be a member of the college with
vote, as is already the case in Wallonia.
Ecolo has also obtained the newsletters and websites of local authorities
are now open to the expression of the democratic opposition trends, such as
recommends the permanent National Commission of the Cultural Covenant. Ecolo proposes to extend this
28

A derived entity is a public company, an inter, a public interest organization or structure
assimilated. See our proposals in Chapter "Public Service, Governance and Public Service" regarding
Democratic control of public companies, public agencies and other entities derived.

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter DEMOCRACY AND ETHICS POLICY - p 12/18

opportunity and improve the information of the citizen-not-s by imposing the mention of the dates of
communal councils and the right to apprehend in the municipal newspaper.
Ecolo also wants to limit the exercise of the function of mayor to two terms
consecutive. A system based exclusively on the preference votes (and Wallonia) is
liable to impede the renewal necessary for democratic vitality. It must therefore be
regulated.
Ecolo supports the designation of the mayor or based on a dual legitimacy, the
within the municipal council and within the population. Ecolo offers and the mayor or
is elected by the municipal council, from the elected and elected with the highest number of preferential votes
within one of the lists forming the majority.
Every citizen living in the municipality may challenge its Municipal College on a topic of interest
local, if it meets the conditions attached to the right of interpellation. The legislative framework of the right
citizen's arrest in the municipal council has been improved in the previous legislature
Wallonia and Brussels. But efforts must still be made at the local level to make
efficient this democratic right of every citizen, 16 years. In addition, to the interpellation
Citizens could lead to a real debate, Ecolo proposes to allow political groups
represented on the board to react to the reply of the College and to grant a right of reply to
citizen who questioned the College. For Ecolo also requires that the inquiry be citizen
widely published and it is transparent (filed by an unincorporated association or group,
whose members and funding sources must be easily identifiable, etc.).
Ecolo finally calls for the establishment of a right of citizens' arrest at the council
police29.

Proposal: Frame political lobbying
Lobbies or interest groups - with a profit or not - sometimes bad
reputation. In some country.30 They are considered ordinary actors of life
policy whose action is governed by formal procedures. The European Union has encouraged
their action in order to preserve the open character of relations between the European institutions and
the public and to allow access to specific technical knowledge in all
kinds of sectors. Some drifts have pushed the European Union to regulate the relations between
institutions and lobbyists. These rules relate in particular to accreditation, a system
registration, directories, codes of conduct and the management and control of
fixées31 compliance with the rules.
Drifts can also be found in Belgium. To ensure openness
parliaments of Belgium Relations with the public and interest groups in particular,
while safeguarding the public interest, Ecolo proposes to transpose the framework provided by Parliament
European in Belgium through the required adaptations.
To this end, Ecolo offers:
the creation of a public register of "lobbyists", managed by the Bureau of each parliament.
The admission criteria would be defined by the office;
establishing a code of conduct approved by the assembly concerned.
Moreover, Ecolo considers it necessary to enhance the traceability of funding and expertise
interest groups that cater to both the government and parliaments.

29

Ecolo also proposes to clarify and review the missions and operation of the police board. View about it
"Safety, Police and Fire."
30
A more or less formal framework is developed in Germany, the United Kingdom to the United States of America, Canada
to guide relations between the Parliament and lobbyists. It is the same at the UN level.
31

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter DEMOCRACY AND ETHICS POLICY - p 13/18

Additionally, Ecolo proposes the drafting of a Charter establishing the independence of
expert consulted by the administration in relation to the latter.

Proposal: Framing the role of the Conference of Mayors Brussels
The nineteen Brussels mayors meet regularly to share
concerns and coordinate their positions. But the role of the Conference of
Mayors sometimes goes far beyond: regularly consulted by ministers, he happens
also to take political steps of the initiative. Yet, instead of a local executive,
intercommunal or regional, the Conference is not the subject of any democratic control. Similarly,
agendas and minutes of meetings of the Conference are not the subject of any
publicity. Ecolo therefore wishes tag the role and functioning of this body.

PRIORITY 4: REFORMING POLITICAL PRACTICES
The democratic regime is not based on universal suffrage alone, nor solely on
representative institutions. The legitimacy of political power carries many quality
Public governance of the proper use of public money and ethics with which
agents and public managers exercise their responsibilities in the service of interest
general.

Proposal: Extend rules decumulation between the parliamentary function
and a local executive mandate
The issue of cumulation between the parliamentary function and a local executive mandate -
mayorship, Alderman and CPAS presidency or chairmanship of an inter or
assimilated structure - appears central in the debate of public governance, such as
accumulation poses major difficulties on several levels.
Indeed, such a combination does not help that the or parliamentary act in the interest of all.
It also raises conflicts of interest: the parliamentarians are in charge of political control
a government, while local executive officers perform their duties within
a subordinate authority, itself subject to political and financial control
Government or so full at the Region - guardianship and power
disciplinary - or piecemeal, skill-based, as regards the
Federal government or community. Finally, the parliamentary function is a work
full-time, paid as such, which must be exercised with the required availability.
Spurred environmentalists, the Walloon parliament introduced an incompatibility of right

between the parliamentary function and all local executive mandate (mayorship, and Alderman
CPAS Presidency) for 75% of parliamentarians. This is a first step. Ecolo proposes to impose
a complete incompatibility (decumulation) to 100% of parliamentary, regional, community
and federal. Moreover, Ecolo also proposes to establish an inconsistency of right between
Parliamentary mandate and that of president of an intermunicipal or a related structure.
Finally, Ecolo supports the removal of the departmental prevention system, especially for
functions mayor or deputy mayor and alderman.

Proposal: Establish an ethics of representation for all
agents
Ecolo intends to improve the political representation by acting on mandates rollups,
conflicts of interest, concentration of power and patronage:

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter DEMOCRACY AND ETHICS POLICY - p 14/18

Erecting criminalized any intervention by the public representatives for the benefit of
individual files to a judicial or administrative authority, and violating the principle
the separation of powers or the principle of equality of citizens before the
law or violating the code of ethics applicable to relationships
public representatives and citizens;
Prohibit the participation of ministers and parliamentarians, to management, administration
or supervision of OIP to mutual societies, trade unions, employers, sector
or professional bodies and companies of a certain size;
Strengthening the rules on missions abroad of the Federal Parliament, including
by limiting the lump sum of the daily allowance;
Next to the incompatibility of law to be established between the parliamentary function and
Local executive mandate, organize, like the Walloon Parliament began to make a
Real decumulation of derivative warrants, including limiting to three the number of mandates
a director or administrator that the same person can assume within a
derived entity, such as a public company, an inter-municipal, or an OIP
assimilated structure;
Regulate the activity of auditors and réviseuses companies within public structures,
like the Walloon reforms: rotation of auditors after a warrant term
three years, renewable once; improving transparency in the award of
market and systematization of competitive bidding; strengthened rules
financial independence by limiting the weight of entities belonging to the same
can represent authority in the fees of a firm; incompatibility
the performance within the same power of an auditor activity and a political function
by the same person;
like the Federal Ethics Commission and the Federal déontologie32 Code,
adopt a code of ethics in specific, clear and demanding; this code
Ethics can not be left to the freedom of individuals but should be decided by the
legislator and with sanctions for non-compliance;
organize a presumption device and control conflicts of interest.

Proposal: To unify and ensure parliamentary status
A parliamentary or should exercise its mandate independently, in order to be
representative of all. To enable the parliamentary fulfill this function, status
Parliamentary equipment was adopted in 1992. Over time, parliaments have each
change the status of their members. There is therefore today the differences between them. TO
Like the status of deputies européens33 - common to all parliamentarians, regardless of the state
member from which they come - Ecolo calls for the establishment of a single material and social status
Parliamentarians. There are no two-tier MPs and MPs have regular
inter-assemblies course. It is therefore important that Parliament and the parliaments of
federated entities shall consult in order to reach a single parliamentary status. This
latter also allow members to find a social situation at the end of their
political engagement, without having to be dependent and independent.
As part of such a unique material status, Ecolo offers:

32

The Federal Ethics Commission is competent to issue opinions and general recommendations as well
confidential opinions at the request of officers (federal parliamentarians, ministers, state secretaries and top
managers).
33
The new Statute for MEPs took effect July 14 2009. It makes clear their conditions
work and introduces a common salary for all, paid for by the budget of the European Union.

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter DEMOCRACY AND ETHICS POLICY - p 15/18

to harmonize the rules of ethics, conflicts of interest and remuneration
(fringe benefits) in all meetings, at the federal, regional,
or community each time from the most demanding rules;
especially at the federal level to align the amounts of compensation for
special functions at the special allowances of the Walloon parliament, Brussels and
the Federation Wallonia-Bruxelles34;
standardize administrative aid made available to a member of parliament;
regulate the amount of départ35 benefits.
Ecolo proposes the development of a social status of parliamentarians. It's about :
opening the right to unemployment benefits to parliamentarians who, after payment
their severance benefits have not found a job;
expand the rights politique36 leave the mandates of federal parliamentarians, regional,
Community and européens37 (the worker became a member of one of these institutions
would be entitled to the complete suspension of his employment contract for the duration of
the exercise of a warrant).

Proposal: To limit the remuneration of public office
Ecolo supports the development of a register of various rewards and benefits of all mandates
public to make an objectification and a limitation of such remuneration, including
based on the responsibilities, competencies and the workload and ensure
transparency in the matter. Ecolo also wants to limit non-monetary benefits
the exercise of certain warrants, in particular encouraging the use of public transport and in
default service vehicles at the expense of company cars.
On a more global level, the legislation currently provides for a maximum income allowed for
all political compensation, set at 150% of the parliamentary allowance, ie around
of € 180,000 per year. This ceiling is too high, especially since it applies only to remuneration linked to
the exercise of warrants or political functions and not those related to certain
special functions or other activities performed in parallel. Ecolo therefore wants
primarily include all remuneration in the envelope submitted to the overall ceiling
remuneration, whether special or ordinary, public or private, or not derived
political activities. Ecolo also intends to gradually reduce this limit to 150%
100% from the parliamentary allowance.

34

Regional and community parliaments have decreased by approximately 50% compensation for special functions, then
that the federal Parliament has made an overall decrease of less than 10%.
35
Ecolo has as a general principle to return the severance indemnity to one month per year of tenure
provides. Ecolo is open to debate on the specific modalities such as minimum and maximum amount of the
severance pay.
36
Currently, only civil servants and teachers were easily entitled to political leave. Ecolo proposes to expand
this right to the private sector.
37
To enable every citizen to make the choice to propose to vote and be elected parliamentarian, it is important that
this choice should be accompanied by a return to the initial guarantee employment after the first term. This type of measurement allows
also to open more calmly discussing the non-cumulation of the parliamentary mandate with another public office or
another profession. The Act of July 19, 1976 established the right to leave for the exercise of a political mandate. This law
allows the private sector to be entitled to political leave in order to fulfill their mandate (member of a board
Provincial, a municipal council, Common Community Commission, the French Community Commissions
and Flemish, the Parliament of the German-speaking Community).
Ecolo wishes to extend this right to the leave policy for members of the House of Representatives, the Senate, Councils
regional or community and the European Parliament. Moreover, the worker became a member of one of these
institutions would be entitled to the complete suspension of his employment contract for the duration of the exercise of a warrant. If the
suspension exceeds the term of a single mandate, the employer may, within a certain time, unilaterally terminate the
work relationship.

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter DEMOCRACY AND ETHICS POLICY - p 16/18

Furthermore, Ecolo considers unacceptable that officers can exercise their responsibilities
public through shell companies to receive their remuneration and so evade tax
individuals. Ecolo therefore intends to ban these workarounds by agents
regional, and local community.
Finally, the rules of remuneration and elected representatives and officers should be retrocessions
Public and easily accessible. More complete information on this subject:
will be an element of political pressure for the reduction of certain compensation
too high;
enable citizens to realize that many public remuneration
are a fair amount.

Proposal: Complete the reform of political party financing and
prohibit sponsorship
In the framework of the VI State Reform and particularly Senate reform, funding
parties was reviewed. Furthermore, particularly in response to certain recommendations
GRECO (Group of States against Corruption, an institution of the European Council) 38, several
measures to promote the supervision and transparency of party funding have
been adopted, such as:
the establishment, alongside parliamentarians, an Independent Commission
Federal control incorporating external experts in its composition;
the possibility of imposing sanctions for the parties, may extend to withholding
for a period of one year for staffing and for candidates, can lead to
suspension or withdrawal of the mandate;
the publication of the balance sheet and income statement of all party components
that is to say of all the association and other entities that revolve around political parties.
Beyond these advances, Ecolo and intends to consolidate the legislation applicable to the
election expenses and party funding (see above).
If Ecolo with Groen, managed to increase the transparency and control of financing
political parties, the fact remains that some situations now better signposted,
should simply be banned. Corporate sponsorship for the political parties is a
kind of private funding of political parties, Ecolo demand a ban like this
occurs at the level of donations. Public funding should allow political parties to preserve
independently by prohibiting any private funding (donation or sponsoring).
Currently, in case of violation of the legislation on electoral expenditure committed by a
proxy, the only possible sanction in respect of a Brussels parliamentary, federal or
Brussels town councilor is suspended or revoked. Similar to what was done in
Wallonia, Ecologist proposes to establish a gradation of sanctions (reprimand, withholding pay,
etc.).

Democracy, Governance and Equal
WOMEN'S EQUALITY - MEN
Story of Women and men
Status and political horizon
State of play
Ecolo's commitment to equality is rooted in the struggle for social justice.
Although we noted good progress in Belgium, the foundations of our organization
Social often remain rooted in a patriarchal model - that is to say a model where authority
and domestic policy is exerted by men, heads of families. Furthermore, even outside
this model, stereotypes and clichés are transported - mostly without one in any
conscious - throughout the education of each and everyone. The adverse effects on the position
Women in our society are undeniable. Thus, the claim for Ecolo
Is the individualisation of rights emblematic of a commitment to get out of this scheme
" traditional ". Indeed, it is recognized that the right to social security is an individual right, the
Practice shows that beneficiaries in general, but women in particular with regard to the
segregation of duties, benefit unequally from the application of this right, and this from
considerations on their lifestyle (single or cohabiting) and their family responsibilities.
In Belgium, despite the inclusion of the principle of equality in the Constitution since 2002 and adoption
of the law on gender mainstreaming1 in 2007, many inequalities remain genre2. Of
corrective policy measures are still needed in order to effectively end these
discrimination, both against women and men in all fields of social life.
Thus, if the share of women with jobs increases, both in Belgium and the scale
European, the employment rate for women remains lower than that of men. In 2011,
Belgium, it was 61.5% against 73% 3. Compared to men, women occupy
usually mean lower quality jobs, lower paid and equivalent
not to their level of qualification. They are faced with more experienced part-time and
unemployment, as well as career breaks, which impairs their right to retire, and explains
Part poverty situation in which there are many of elles4. The wage gap exists
Always in Belgium. Across all sectors, it ranged from 10% (hourly wages) and 23%
(annual salary) to 20105. The women.6 face a higher risk to benefit from
Revenue from long-term integration. The over-representation of older women also draws
attention and requires an approach to their needs in terms of gender. Finally, women are
also under-represented in positions of responsibility.
1
Gender mainstreaming is the (re) organization, improvement, development and evaluation of policy processes,
in order to incorporate a gender perspective in all policies at all levels and by all actors
concerned by the implementation of the policy (Council of Europe, 1998).
2
The term "gender" refers to the roles, behaviors, activities and functions socially constructed, that
given society considers appropriate for women and men (Article 3 of) the Istanbul Convention).

A crucial issue that society begins to grasp is that of violence. Women are
the most frequent victims of both physical and moral violence: harassment, violence
sexual and domestic, rape. In September 2012, Belgium signed the first instrument
binding in the fight against violence against women: the Council's Convention
Europe on the prevention and fight against violence against women and violence
domestic, called "Istanbul Convention". Its ratification is underway and will generate a
number of bonds that can already be anticipated.
Finally, in terms of mobility, it is women who use more public transport, there
including within households with a car. This results in some of duty
work part-time to achieve combine work and family life.

Political horizon
Equality is part of the foundations of political ecology. Ecolo wants to continue deconstructing
preconceptions and stereotypes that fuel from an early age a conservative vision of roles
women and men and their place in society. Freed from unfair discrimination,
more autonomous in their rights and duties, more aware of differences based harmony
their reports, women and men will be ready to build a successful society in its
male and female dimensions, a joint company to truly sustainable development.
Ecolo highlights proposals in all areas. A shared responsibility
between women and men through a redefinition of roles whose goal is equality and quality
of life of each and everyone.
Public policies should improve the position and status of women and everything to
anticipate and avoid potential negative externalities for them. A specific strategy and
proactive is necessary to break the old mechanisms and reduce the gap between equal
right and equality. Stimulate, develop and ensure participation in all processes
political decision of women in particular and citizens in general, whether
individually or through associations, ensures the health of democracy.
Gender equality is a matter of social justice and is as much about women as
men, the latter also Prisoners of roles that society assigns to them. A man
who wishes to take a break career to care for her children is ill or become puériculteur
judged by our society. The equality thus requires the awareness of a situation of inequality
a group relative to another. To prevent the recurrence inequality over the
generations, gender equality also goes by another approach, from an early age,
maternity, nursery and school.
Generally, Ecolo therefore intends to strengthen the policy of gender mainstreaming
public. That is to say, the mainstreaming of gender and equality objective in
the policies. They thus gain in coherence and relevance. This requires the
development of a series of tools, including the strengthening of statistical data and indicators
gendered.

Ecolo force lines on equality between women and men
are the following :
Ensure the professional and wage equality
Individualize rights and to eliminate tax inequities
End discrimination against women
Ending violence against women
Ensuring equality between women and men in Europe and the world

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter EQUALITY MEN-WOMEN - p 2/22

Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: ENSURE EQUAL WORK AND PAY
In 1966, the workers of Fabrique Nationale Herstal weapons went on strike
obtaining a right "equal work, equal pay". Since then, lois7 prohibit all
wage discrimination based on sex and require equality of treatment between women and
men. But the reality is different, wage gaps persist: women earn 22%
less than men.
There is firstly a vertical segregation of labor. The higher you climb in the hierarchy less
we find women. This phenomenon commonly called the "glass ceiling" leads to
discrimination not only in terms of hierarchy, but also pay for
Women, who do not see their experience and valued monetarily and in terms degree of
responsibilities in the same way as men.
Moreover, the functions occupied by women rarely receive the benefits "out
wages "(use of a company car, gift certificates, training visits, insurance
Additional hospitalization or insurance interest groups ...). It is not a question here of
remuneration necessarily mean that environmentalists support as such but
still involved in the gender pay gap within a company, particularly between
women and men. We realize in fact that women negotiate more flexibility
in their schedules to reconcile the education of children and their work rather
material benefits.
There is also a horizontal segregation of work. Women's employment is concentrated in a
limited number of occupations and industries. In these sectors, it does not address the
working in the same manner as in the "masculinized" sectors. This leads to
discrimination. In Belgium, it is estimated that nearly 11% of the differential remuneration is
explained and justified by Night bonuses and overtime. However, as regards the
night work, increases differ by sector: modest for nurses,
important for the workers of printing. Regarding the overtime,
feminized sectors avoid granting increases through the extension of employment contracts on time
part, whereas in the masculinized sectors, is often attributed a salary increase
general and permanent.

Proposal: To ensure policy coherence, to strive for equal pay
To bridge the pay gap, it is first necessary to use assessment tools. In 2012,
a law was passed providing inter alia that every company must provide, via the social balance sheet and
a report on the remuneration policy, information workers to analyze
causes of inequality. An action plan and the appointment of a mediator or mediator
are also planned. The law also provides that function classifications of workers
neutral in terms of gender, will be proofread by an auditor in order to avoid their
sources of inequality.It should first conduct an evaluation of the implementation of the law in order to measure
the concrete effects.
Ecolo also proposes to fight against wage inequality:

7
There is an accumulation of commitments and principles since 1975 at European level. There is a directive, a code of
conduct, action programs, pay inequality indicators (2001). In Belgium, there is a law,
collective labor agreements, a classification of functions and gender mainstreaming.

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter EQUALITY MEN-WOMEN - p 3/22

to continue to educate businesses and workers to the problems of inequality
salary;
maintain the right to supplement unemployment for workers to
forced and involuntary part-time;
to improve the protection afforded to the most vulnerable people on the market
work (migrant women with little education, single parents, disabled persons ...) via
for example, increasing the minimum wage; and outside the market
Work: link social benefits to welfare and individualisation of rights;
to halt the loss of income caused by maternity leave or
career break to take on family responsibilities;
contribute to the strengthening of women hold important positions (capacity
negotiation, fight against stereotypes and prejudices towards capacity
women ...) to break the "glass ceiling".

Proposal: Fight not chosen time and partial deregulation
work
Part-time work accounts for a quarter of total employment, 44% of women are affected by these
part-time, against 9% of men.8. Inequality persists in the proportion of time jobs
not chosen part, predominantly occupied by women, which has consequences
unequal salary levels both in terms of social rights.
Ecolo favors full-fledged worker status and request the establishment of a monitoring
Permanent part-time and its evolution in different sectors but
Also various forms of employment contracts which coexist.

Proposal: Share time to reconcile work and family life
Equality between women and men also requires equal treatment in their choices
family.
As for paternity leave at the birth of the child, demands a leave Ecolo
longer compulsory and paternity, complementarily to that of the mother, so that the
father can fulfill its role.
The right to parental leave is meanwhile for each child under 12 for both
Parents individually. In 2011, the proportion of fathers who took parental leave, if it were
on the increase was still lower than that of mothers: ¼ to ¾ environ9. Ecolo hears
therefore encourage both parents to take parental leave, created precisely the aim
to help them better balance their private life and their professional life, and he has been proven that
is beneficial to both the family and the employer.
Furthermore, Ecolo proposes to review periods treated at work in the direction of better
Consideration of periods of decline or work stoppage, related for example to a
maternity or choice (male or female) to stop working, especially to share
tasks and responsibilities within the family.
Ecolo finally proposes to safeguard the social rights of caregivers, those people who stop
work to concentrate on coaching and the care of a dependent person
their family. It is mainly women who choose, or more often who are obliged,
to interrupt their professional career. It should not penalize them in their pension and

in maintaining their sociaux10 rights. Ecolo finally wants more people in
the family share the tasks so that each can keep or not an activity
professional side.

Proposal: Guaranteeing a decent pension to women.11
The consequences of the Life Course and employability and therefore the differences,
including salary, between women and men remain perceptible to life until the
Construction of the pension. For example, married couples receiving two pensions,
man receives on average a monthly pension of 948 euros and 639 women a pension
euros. These figures notably explained by the wage gap between men and women
explains itself by the type of employment, positions held and duration of careers.
Pension reform of the outgoing Government has focused solely on the extension of the
term careers. However, even if the data on the length of service are few
currently, we find that these career conditions are far from being met, especially
for women, often because they have interrupted their career to take care of
family chores and care for children and elders (see above). The workers - as
workers but less likely - so will dramatically increase
their career to qualify for a full pension.
Ecolo therefore proposes:
identify measures to erase the unjustifiable pay differences between
men and women and propose their implementation (see above), so that
pro-deserved pension amounts experiencing the same trend;
to raise the lowest pensions so that pensioners and pensioners can
live with pension income above the poverty line. While equal pay
during the career is in this respect a relevant answer since statutory pension provision
based on career, but it must act beyond that not a single pensioner is
faced with poverty.
Furthermore, many forms of discrimination exist in the supplementary pension. There
half of male employees are insured against third group of
workers. The higher the income the first pension pillar, the higher the proportion of retirees
Access to the 2nd pillar increases. However, only a limited number of retired women up to
categories of highest income, which is the access level generally 2nd pillar
low. Furthermore, the amounts granted under the 2nd pillar are on average lower
for women who benefit than for men. Therefore Ecolo offers:
allow access to the second pillar of pensions for all whether it should continue to
develop ;
to review the policy of assimilation (periods of professional inactivity considered
in the calculation of pensions) to less penalizing certain "choice" of life, in reality
often suffered, women (involuntary part-time, excluding unemployed
cohabitant ...);
to individualize the rights to social security, while ensuring the maintenance
acquired rights (see below).

11

Ecolo has filed a bill to that effect.
For more information on the proposed Ecolo on pensions, see Chapter "Elders-pensions".

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter EQUALITY MEN-WOMEN - p 5/22

Proposal: Promoting entrepreneurship féminin12
Ecolo is responsible for the realization of a social status for spouses
caregivers. The system came into force in all its dimensions in July 2005. However,
rest of the way to go. The independent activities of women are generally more
limited (smaller and smaller scale), with less capital and less access
to credit. They often work alone and are limited to embark (30%). They
considering the types of activities which do not authorize or to rest or to establish or expand a family.
To enable women to engage in optimal conditions, we must understand their
needs and enhance the corporate image of woman leader in a world still largely
male.
For Ecolo, it should include:
to support networks of entrepreneurs and foster mentoring, disseminating
good practice, exchange of information and advice, solidarity;
to raise awareness of a business (banking, accounting ...) to
female entrepreneurship;
to improve the financing of female entrepreneurship projects;
to ensure the visibility of self-employed women, in particular through
Ambassadors of female entrepreneurship;
adapt schedules of childcare early childhood and after-school home
to accommodate irregular hours associated with most indépendantes13 activities;
allow the creation of incubators, including but not limited
female, with a tax incentive for joint crèches;

to provide the possibility of separation during pregnancy for certain types

thus authorizing subject to conditions, the performance of partial self-employment;
create a solidarity fund to replace aid for self. He exists
Belgium currently an independent registry substitutes (database
allows the independent finding a "self-replacing"), but this tool is
still little used. To remedy this situation and support independent prey
the difficulties, Ecolo proposes the establishment of a Solidarity Fund to help replace.
This assistance is intended to ensure that the replacement carried out by the "Contractor replacing" him
ensures a minimum income equivalent to that of the integration income for isolated. The
Funding would come from a voluntary contribution of independent (1.1%
quarterly contributions). This assistance is for certain compelling cases (as listed
by the law of April 28, 2010): period of primary incapacity and disability leave
maternity, palliative care to a child or a partner, a child care seriously
sick ;

pooling of resources, of workers between several independent;

women entrepreneurs.

Proposal: To support women's access to sustainable business
Through Employment Alliance - Environment inter alia, are possible sources of jobs
in new business sectors and so-called "green" 14. A gender analysis shows that
Most new jobs are in the scientific and technical sectors in which
Women were poorly represented to date: building insulation, energy, heating, agriculture ... To
these sustainable businesses also concern women, it should include:
to conduct awareness campaigns to interest girls in school types
technical and scientific fighting against stereotypes and encouraging
schools to accommodate as well as boys;
balance between women and men, the devolution of public incentives to projects based
on sustainable business;
to highlight the social and educational aspects of sustainable jobs;
to provide support to organizations working on the topic of expanding
selection professionals to encourage women to apply for positions normally
occupied by men and vice versa;
enhance the attractiveness of scientific studies and careers for women.

Proposal: Make governments, utilities and businesses
more private joint
The Constitution provides in Article 11 bis, a portrayal of the sexes
different in all executive political bodies. If this is a first step, the
minimum presence of a woman or a man in each decision-making body is
though still far from allowing a balanced representation. Furthermore, the phenomenon of
"Glass ceiling" that is to say the quickest cap women's careers, has
also been widely demonstrated.
Ecolo wants to make the concern of the essential gender analysis in process
appointment and recruitment in the public sector. In the public service, the system of
renewable terms after evaluation, driven by environmentalists, is to allow
that are consistent with the principles of objectification skills and political responsibility
in the appointment process of some senior officials. In this context, the political authority
must ensure integrated, with equal skills, a gender balance.
In terms of the composition of governments and other executive bodies, it should also
see too low female presence. Eco has a minimum number of one-third
members from both sexes sit on all governments and executive bodies

14

See in this respect Chapter "Employment and Vocational Training".

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter EQUALITY MEN-WOMEN - p 7/22

so that they are properly established. Draft laws and decrees were filed
at all levels of power for this purpose.

Proposal: To promote equality between women and men at the heart of
associative action
When an association benefit from a subsidy of a public authority, the management bodies
must be accessible to both women and men and equal treatment in terms
access and share resources must be guaranteed. Exceptions may be considered,
both against women and men (associations for the protection of persons
such as shelters for battered women, for example, or night shelters should
not suffer from the mix). The message and the values ​​conveyed by the Association can not be
contradiction with the right to equality between women and men.

PRIORITY 2: RIGHTS AND INDIVIDUALLY ENDING INEQUALITY
SOCIAL
Designed at the end of World War II, social security denotes a historical view
"Familialist" remains pregnant in all its components. This is mainly manifested
by the coexistence of direct rights and derived rights. In other words, each individual gets
Rights not only in terms of its contribution but also his family situation. This
causing difficulties and leads to inequality.
Thus many women receive social benefits without ever contributed.
These are derived rights. Other women see the benefits they receive reduced,
or even eliminated, by a change in their family situation (if they become cohabiting by
example, or when experiencing separation or divorce). Gives a contribution
therefore no need to equal compensation, it is modulating according to the household situation
the social beneficiary.

Proposal: Individualize social rights
For Ecolo, the goal is the individualization of social rights. Each adult pay
individual social contributions that would open their own rights, independently of its
family situation and the evolution of it. This requires a comprehensive reform of the system.
This change, however, must be achieved gradually, taking into account the acquired rights.
In the pension sector, we must begin by bearing and by age cohort, so
enable everyone to adapt to the new rules.
Ecolo rejects any extension of secondary rights. Instead, Ecolo proposed that the issue of
equal treatment between common lifestyles an opportunity for input
to change the design "pro-family" of social security and to trigger the application of
the individualisation of rights.

Proposal: Fight gender inequalities facing tax
Ecolo proposes to reform the personal income tax (PIT) in view of a
individualisation equivalent to that proposed for Social Security: in this
perspective, the marital allowance should be gradually replaced by direct rights
tax matters.
We also note that it is very difficult to obtain tax data disaggregated by sex. Now, it is
an elementary basis for assessing the contribution of each and every one according to his

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter EQUALITY MEN-WOMEN - p 8/22

income. Ecolo proposes that conducted a research on the cost / benefit of taxation
Belgium gender sensitive, as tax statistics are available with a
gender distribution and that we develop a tool to understand how and to what
tax measures involved in the construction or maintenance of inequalities between women and
men.

Proposal: Adopt and implement a plan for the optimization of funds
maintenance claims
Created in 2004, the maintenance payments service (SECAL) was established within the Federal Service
Finance. Its purpose is to prevent poverty due to non-payment of pensions
food. In 2011 a report15 mentioned that at December 31, 2009, had treated the SECAL
33,534 records, introduced to 94% by women for the recovery of maintenance claims
Unpaid and / or for advances on the 150,000 potential cases.
Obviously, access to the heaviness SECAL remains high. It is therefore appropriate:
to continue the dissemination of information to the public about the existence of SECAL,
so that everyone knows their rights. This campaign should be undertaken in all
public places such as post offices, town halls, courthouses and ...
not just in the CPAS;
to provide explicit tools for judges, notaries, lawyers involved
in marriage contracts, in divorce or separation procedures for
communicate to their customers and clients;
to apply the same method of calculating contributions food in all courses
and family courts. A clear method, unified and known would avoid
many conflicts between parents
to estimate the financing needed to meet the demands and needs
of all single-parent families affected by bad debts;
removing the revenue cap that provides access to advances systems
outstanding claims;
simplifying procedures and operation of the SECAL and steps to
the parties are receiving their pension;
to seek a new approach to debtors and to study ways of preventing
non-payment of support;
create a federal database for any judgment on pensions
food, accessible if necessary by the SECAL; Indeed, too often, for lack of papers
in order, rights holders can not enforce their rights;
to provide a mediator to help the parent "single parent", in case of difficulty, to
assert a right to alimony for children;
to collect and publish data to determine the number of maintenance claims
and the number of unpaid debtors or families concerned but also profiles
families, accounts receivable, the amount of unpaid pensions, length of arrears, delays
delay, sidings ... All policy elements, but are not
unknown.
It is also still necessary to act on the practical consequences of lodging
egalitarian in order to avoid unfair situations between parents or a parent is

PRIORITY 3: DISCRIMINATION TO TERMINATE AGAINST WOMEN
Proposal: Ban the sexisme16 and stereotypes from an early age
Despite progress, and particularly the participation of women in the world of work,
gender barrier has not disappeared.
The discrimination against women, but also their denial, are based on
gender relations. This social system is also symbolically repaired by
a series of actors: the advertisements that depict women's products
domestic; the unequal representation of women in emissions, reports or interviews
political or scientific; the categorization of professions by sex; manufacturers and shops
toys that continue to offer toys that young children refer to a distribution
Traditional social roles: the girls to the home environment (dolls, dinette ...), boys
the strength and masculinity (cars, weapons ...) 17. Stereotypes are well integrated from an early
age, persist in schooling and then in private and professional sphere.
It is therefore appropriate to adopt a series of measures deconstruction of stereotypes
sexistes18:
Ecolo proposes to introduce gender issues and the fight against stereotypes in
initial and continuing training of all professionals in contact with
children and youth (midwives, friendly and welcoming to children, nursery nurses
and child care workers, doctors, teachers, educators ...)
Place of education, schools should promote the deconstruction of stereotypes and
egalitarian development of students. Therefore Ecolo proposes to introduce these materials
in the initial and further training of those involved in education and introduce
explicit reference to the fight against sexism and the promotion of equal
gender as criteria for approval of school textbooks and software and other tools
pédagogiques19;
Equality between women and men and the fight against discrimination,
sexist stereotypes and prejudice are included in the management contract RTBF 20132017. This is a first step in the right direction, but wish these Ecolo
principles are rooted in the media and advertising in daily life;
Ecolo also proposes to regulate advertising to children under 12 years
and encourage neutral messages to children (toy catalogs
unisex, for example);
Work the employment stereotypes and métiers20 is also needed to
to encourage women and men to access jobs traditionally
assigned to the opposite sex: technical trades attributed to men, trades
Social attributed to women. This requires a revaluation of certain businesses: the
support for initiatives like the Education Fund of the construction that
developed a "construction of any kind" unit to promote these trades to

Ecolo has filed a bill "to suppress certain acts motivated by sexism."
See for example the film "Male domination" http://www.ladominationmasculine.net

Just like the call for projects launched by the Minister-President of the COCOF, Christos Doulkeridis, "He / She: beyond the

Proposal: To ensure better access to health care
One in four believes that his health is bad. Stress, lifestyle, family
comes before everything else, lack of means. The right to health is a fundamental human right,
Key to the realization of other rights. Should be ensured access to the health system,
the health education, health services and sexual and reproductive rights,
particularly migrant women whose situation is aggravated by the lack of sensitivity
and cultural understanding among stakeholders.
Ecolo offers include:
improve working conditions for women and men by acting on the
working hours, the reduction of working time which guarantees full rights to
working time considered part today;
improve coaching and pre and post-natal monitoring of mothers and children.21 via
an extension of pre- and postnatal consultations, particularly among populations
weakened;
facilitate access to cancer screening (breast, cervix ...) women
disadvantaged through an organization around these screenings;
to fight against the messages and images involving food and
excessive thinness. Anorexia, bulimia, overweight treated with unbalanced diets are
many diseases that particularly affect our girls;
adapt policies against smoking to new developments, including
with girls who are more likely to smoke despite anti-smoking campaigns.
Women are also those most concerned about health "of others

" : parents,
children, brother / sister ... This situation is likely to worsen with the aging challenge. So,
Ecolo he proposes a series of measures for women and health care providers to put a
term loss of income caused by a career break but also to give
helping proche22 status.
Moreover, in most European countries, migrant women are affected so
disproportionate policies that affect access to care (family planning, care
pre- and postnatal ...) according to legal status. Undocumented women are eight times more
at risk of unwanted pregnancies, ten times more likely to start care
Prenatal late or eight times more exposed to violence during pregnancy as
Women with légal23 status.
In addition to ensuring equal access to health policies, regardless of the status of people,
be trained health service providers to intercultural dialogue and establish
bridges with migrant women's organizations.

European Network of Migrant Women.
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter EQUALITY MEN-WOMEN - p 11/22 Proposal: Provide access to mobility and enhancing diversity in space
public
Women are the largest users of public space, mobility takes a place
capital in their lives. Ensuring access to mobility is an essential condition to ensure
social inclusion: access to the workplace, in search of employment, services, leisure,
family, relationships ...
The development of public space also plays a significant role in the problem
mobility. The way it is designed and implemented increases or decreases the feeling
insecurity. So friendly and safe public spaces can contribute to a better
mobility of women but also to all of their users.
For Ecolo, should:
integrate the gender dimension in mobility policies, urban planning and
of land, this from the analysis of projects and to evaluation,
including working with women's associations;
to involve women by active methods (exploratory walks ...) in the
renovation and development of public spaces and take into account the
analysis, collective action, women's experiences;
develop gender indicators to be used in the development or
rehabilitation of roads, underground car parks and public space (lighting
night performer, floor covering, wide sidewalks ...);
to analyze the areas causing insecurity and propose
adequate facilities both in public spaces and in the transport and
Bus stops stations / Metro / tram (clear signage, proper lighting ...)
to lead reflection on the Establishment of the bus stop to the request for
certain hours of the night and for some lines (when the distance between stops is
consistent or in a secluded spot in the dark ...).
Proposal: Allowing the choice of name enfant24
At the beginning of XXI century in the context of a changing society in particular with
regarding life choices, it is important to adapt the mode of transmission of the name to children.
The Institute for the Equality of Women and Men Press the Belgian political world to act,
stressing that Belgium violates international regulations on discrimination
kind. It recommends amending the Civil Code so that the names of both parents are passed
to their child and to ensure genuine equality between women and men. He exists
now a consensus to remove this inequality in our legislation concerning the name and
that the fact that fathers and mothers must be able to choose the family name of their
child.
Ecolo supports free choice of parents to assign their child either the father's name or the
name of the mother, or both names in the order chosen by them. From the second generation,
parents who carry a double name would choose the names of their children among their four
names, so that a child has more than two names joined as double name. The unit
the family name would prevail: the choice made for the first child worth to others
children of the same couple, so they all have the same nom25. The advantage of this
proposal is to support change in current mentality without forcing any
torque to follow. It thus allows the Civil Code provisions on transmission

Proposal: Engendering budgets and public policies
To talk of gender mainstreaming in public policies, it is essential to count
with tools and procedures that enable the identification and analysis of the situation of
females and males, to meet their needs by targeting gender equality and
to identify policy priorities in this regard.
A gendered approach to budgeting ensures that women and men, girls and boys
to benefit equitably allocated resources; it aims to strengthen the capacity
Women's Action.
This does not necessarily increase budget but otherwise distribute involves
revenue and expenditure, based on the priority needs for gender equality.
Gender sensitive budgets also enhance democracy by strengthening the responsibility of
Government towards equality between women and men, by ensuring that expenditure
public primarily benefit those who are most in need, improving
transparency and participation of women in the budget, so political decisions.
The Brussels-Capital Region adopted an order mainstreaming of
gender in policies of the Brussels-Capital Region (Gender mainstreaming) and has Cocof
did the same in the context of an order under the leadership of Secretary of State ecologist. These texts,
very similar to the federal law of 2007 stipulates that every draft legislative act or
Regulatory must be, first, a report assessing its impact on
situation of women and men. A similar order to that of the Brussels Region is
in preparation for the Cocom.
Ecolo wants Wallonia gears in the same direction, beginning with experiments
Drivers in regional services. An evaluation of the policy of equality is of Wallonia
also necessary in the framework of reporting the Beijing Action Plan.
But the law should not be limited to its intentions, it is important that it be materialized. Now we must
find that the measures taken by the federal government since 2011 on unemployment,
credit-time, career breaks have specific impacts on women and that this
has not been taken into account.
The socio-economic policies have indeed affect equality between women and
men. Thus lengthening careers, access to pension conditions,
time credits, etc. have a proportionately larger impact on women (see above).
It is therefore essential that this differential impact is taken into account to ensure consistency
political: it is useless to enact laws to combat against inequality between women and
men, if this principle is not respected in sectoral policies: employment, pension,
social …
PRIORITY 4: ENDING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
Assaults and rapes are more often followed by complaints, which amounted to more
jour26 by eight. Zero tolerance announced by the authorities is not yet reality. The complaints
are still sometimes minimized by police or legal services who receive them. The
Associations that welcome and support the victims of rape and sexual assault missing
cruelly means to address needs, particularly in Wallonia.
26
Annex to the last report Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination contre Wowen (CEDAW) of Belgium.
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter EQUALITY MEN-WOMEN - p 13/22 Intimate partner violence is the most common form of violence. In 2010, the Institute for
Equality between Women and Men (IEFH) estimated that one woman in seven was confronted
at least one act of violence committed by his (former) partner in the last 12 months. And
in most cases the perpetrators are men while the victims are
Women, of which only a minority (13.9%) complaint. Women are more often
victims of violence due to a close (intimate partner, a family member, a
colleague ...) while men are most often due to a stranger.
Violence against women is rooted in inequality between women and men
and originates in the social roles assigned to women and men. His
eradication should be integrated into a broader elimination of discrimination between Action
women and men.
Since 2001, Belgium materialize its commitments through an Action Plan national27
bringing together the priority actions to combat violence between (former) partners and,
on preventive, curative and repressive plans while coordinating different initiatives
federal, regional and community ministers. The last NAP 2010-2014 was expanded to
forms of violence such as forced marriages, female genital mutilation and
honor-related violence. The NAP 2014-2018 will be extended to sexual violence.
These actions must be continued and strengthened with process indicators, result and
impact.
Proposal: To ensure policy coherence and develop harvesting
gendered data
A set of measures are needed to fight effectively against all forms of
violence, with a coherent and coordinated national vision. It is the role of the Action Plan
national. This must lead to a genuine policy research and integrated pursuit
at national level to reduce the reluctance of victims to file complaints to the facts
they are victims. The next NAPs should incorporate sexual harassment to of
coordinate this policy with the policy on sexual violence.
Furthermore, the collection and publication of statistical data, research and studies are
possible to obtain a state of the regular places and efficaces28 assessments.
Proposal: Strengthen prevention
The prevention of physical or moral violence against women requires more
policies:
Continue public prevention campaigns;
Develop and strengthen the awareness tools of violence in relationships
amorous youth, animations to your social life, emotional and sexual in
the school curriculum for all students in primary and secondary;
Developing a policy approach, scientific and sociological violence, to
how our society tolerates and even produced and causes;
Establish policies to banish sexism and gender stereotypes (see
supra);
Support associations that work to prevent and raise public awareness;
27
The last National Action Plan against partner violence and other forms of intra-family violence
was concluded for the period 2010-2014.
28
Ecolo calls for the continuation and expansion of the development of a set of indicators reflecting the complexity and
diversity of women's situations (violence, income, poverty ...) (statistics "gendered").
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter EQUALITY MEN-WOMEN - p 14/22 Provide training for professionals (including police and prosecutors) who
face such violence and raise awareness of the influence that the context "gendered"
can have on them;
Study further the situations experienced by children who witness domestic violence
their consequences in order to implement the right policies.
Proposal: Develop and fund victim assistance
To address the double victimization of women on violence - from
the aggressor and the impact of legal proceedings on the trauma of the victim, which may in
certain circumstances cause a second trauma - it should give an answer
adapted and coordinated requests for these women.
All reception facilities for victims (police, doctors, planning centers, homes
home, emergency services and urgent aid groups "speech" of victim assistance
youth ...) should be strengthened and coordinated within the framework of concerted action at all
levels to ensure prompt and adequate care of the victim. This is e.g.
prevent a victim who files a complaint is asked to track then go home - and thus to
alongside his assailant, in a place of lack of adequate reception facilities.
Furthermore, all actors and stakeholders (justice, police, social services, etc.)
must be specially trained to home, monitoring and coaching people,
especially women victims of violence. For example: providing a person
specially trained in each police station.
It should also prevent the possibility for authors of domestic violence who
see condemned to a prison sentence of less than three years, to be placed under surveillance
e home of victime29. Like the social investigation in cases of sexual violence
of juveniles, Ecolo proposes to introduce a social investigation of perpetrators
intrafamily when placed under electronic surveillance. The social survey is also
necessary in the preparation of electronic surveillance. Finally, therapy and follow-up author
domestic violence is essential in this case.
Proposal: To ensure adequate monitoring of perpetrators of domestic violence
A truly integrated policy to fight against violence against women is meaningful only
if a coherent policy is being conducted against the perpetrators.
This is to strengthen the support and funding of associations that empower authors
domestic violence on a voluntary basis (French Community) and compulsory (justice) in
collaboration with associations that provide assistance to victims.
Finally, it should develop a policy for monitoring of perpetrators of domestic violence within
prisons, as part of the power electronic surveillance and on exit. It is
essential that these perpetrators are supported and empowered in their behaviors
before their release - this obviously involves reviewing the conditions of detention in
the prisons30. The opportunity to build on the pilot project "COSA31" Flanders should be considered.
The objective is to develop a social network around the perpetrator to his release from prison in
to avoid recidivism and to support the possible return home, particularly in case of port
electronic bracelet.

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter EQUALITY MEN-WOMEN - p 15/22 Proposal: Change laws to strengthen the fight against physical violence
or legal against women
Several adjustments should intervene to strengthen policies to fight against
Violence against women:
Edit the law of 15 May 2012 on the temporary prohibition in the case of residence
domestic violence, to ensure its effectiveness and fulfill the requirements of the
Istanbul Convention and the directive on the protection order européenne32. he
are mainly:
-
Create real protection for the victim, which is fully coordinated
with all the existing procedures for domestic violence;
-
As regards the duration of the measurement, ensure consistency with other
measures that concern the family. For example, ten days renewable once if
the claim is brought before a judge of the seat. In this case, the judge may
extend for six months and, in case of introduction of an application for divorce
married couples until the divorce;
The prohibition of access to the common residence in a domestic violence perpetrator must be
accompanied by a psycho-social monitoring of the victim and of the author;
It is not enough to resolve the issue of eviction of the home of the perpetrator in
urgency. The Belgian civil law since 2003 establishes certain rules for such longer
term. Now, from frontline workers, the law is not always easy to
apply. Furthermore, the Act of 5 May 2012 provides no linkage with these
provisions, in contrast to what is done in other countries and that the Convention
Istanbul provides. It is therefore important when assessing thoroughly the Law of 28
January 2003 on the allocation of the family home to the victim of physical violence because
his partner, for the change in coordination with the measures outlined above, and the whole policy on violence against women;
Explore opportunities to change the criminal law in order to qualify assaults
as sexual violent offenses and not as an attack on morality
as recommended by the UN Committee on the Elimination of all Discrimination
against women. So far Belgium has always argued that it was too
a complicated legal drafting point of view without trying to find a solution.
Proposal: To fight against pimping and human trafficking
Environmentalists are engaged in a struggle against all forms of exploitation of the person
prostitute, either in the context of trafficking or procuring. However, some people
prostitutes are victims of violence (physical, legal, financial).
In this context, there is a multitude of actions to be undertaken at all levels to curb
mechanics of trafficking, exploitation and all modern forms of slavery.
Ecolo proposes:
conduct prevention policies: socio-economic measures, information campaigns,
education on gender equality;
make more rigorous checks are marked places where forms of exploitation
sexual and mechanisms that fuel trafficking;
32
2011/99 / EU
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter EQUALITY MEN-WOMEN - p 16/22 better inform independent prostitutes of their rights and obligations, including
tax, however, knowing that this system will not affect people experiencing
illegal, which represent the vast majority of prostitutes;
support associations that accompany and inform prostitutes;
develop information campaigns and customer awareness about the system
(links to organized crime, violence, exploitation) in which they could
Subscribe to.
Proposal: Fight violence in the name of honor and
Forced marriages
The honor-related violence are based on a stereotyped concept of the family and
archaic traditions that may exist in various religions, communities and cultures. The
honor-related violence committed mainly against women, it should be the
fight, like all violence against women.
Moreover, marriage laws and practices vary enormously from one country to another. In the
Most developing countries, between 20 and 70 percent of young women marry before
age 18 and child marriage is the main cause of global pregnancies occurring
before the age of 15 years. Unicef, as well as the UN Implementation Committee of the Convention on
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women urged countries to adopt
the minimum age of 18 for marriage for both sexes.
If it is difficult to identify these facts, which often take place in private, should:
strengthen the state of knowledge of these issues;
ensure good coordination and cooperation between sectors: services
help, family planning centers, schools, first responders, etc. ;
develop awareness among teachers, doctors, gynecologists and other
first responders about the risks or risk situations as well
support services;
to maintain pressure on governments at bilateral political dialogues or
multilateral order that the minimum age of marriage is 18 years (without consent
parenting for young people who wish to marry);
develop prevention: in families mainly concerned in connection with
the voluntary sector and avoiding stigmatization of communities; in the medium
school through educational activities at the emotional and sexual life; via
integration process;
ensure specific accommodation suitable and secure victims
forced marriages and honor-related violence.
Proposal: To fight against female genital mutilation
Belgian law condemns and punishes all FGM practices
(excision of the clitoris, infibulation ...) and victims of female genital mutilation or
risk children can receive protection (youth law, civil law or in matters
asylum). Although concerted strategies are bearing first fruits in Belgium, as in
other Western countries hosting communities from countries that practice
excision and other mutilations, too many girls are still victims.
This includes:
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter EQUALITY MEN-WOMEN - p 17/22 to improve the detection of female genital mutilation, develop prevention (in
maternity services or in the pre- and postnatal consultations by the NEB
example) and the protection of children;
to provide information, especially about the cultural context, and training
social and medical stakeholders in a preventive framework and a supported
Adequate victims;
to advance in the repayment of a multidisciplinary supported by INAMI before
and after the clitoral reconstruction. In fact, surgery can repair the sequelae
psychological FGM, comprehensive support is
necessary ;
improve the situation of victims of genital mutilation asylum seekers. Indeed,
Belgium has undertaken to protect women victims or threatened with mutilation
Genital during the 57th session of the Commission on the Status of Women at the UN
the elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls. Now the
practice of asylum authorities moving towards a tightening in the consideration of a
fear of FGM, especially for asylum seekers from Guinea. It should
therefore to ensure effective protection against FGM, especially when fear
respect girls.

THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE WORLD
Proposal: Adopt the "clause of the most favored European '
The European Union has changed the laws of the Member States by providing the legal bases
the principle of equality. In 1957, the Treaty of Rome already provided a legal framework, notably in
Article 119 which was established the principle of equal pay. Since then, several directives
Europe emerged concerning equal treatment in access to employment, training,
professional promotion and working conditions. Some countries demonstrate voluntarism
the example of Spain, at the forefront in the fight against violence between partners through
under the law of 28 December 2004, and in the struggle against stereotypes through a law banning
sexist advertising. Parental leave in Sweden, well known now, is also commonly cited
example.
The European Union also has an Institute for Gender Equality, voted more
resolutions and developed a multi-year action plan for equality.
Yet the one hand, we see in different countries pronouncements questioning
Some women's rights such as the right to abortion. These pronouncements are a
risk of decline of women's rights in the European Union. On the other hand, there are wide
disparities between national laws and situations of European women.
Ecolo has to relay the proposal to Gisèle Halimi and align the top of the condition
Making the EU benefit from the most advanced right and align well in each
area, on the most favorable provisions existing in the various countries of the Union européenne33.
In 2008, a comparative study of the laws of 27 EU countries set the legislative package
more favorable to femmes34.

A draft resolution was tabled in the House of Representatives in this direction.
May 2008 Choose the cause of women, women Editions.
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter EQUALITY MEN-WOMEN - p 18/22 Proposal: Support migrant women
Migrant women often face particular problems: racism,
illiteracy, lack of access to skills training, discrimination in school or at work,
lack of information for proper management of their health, domestic violence (undocumented
without protection), legal difficulties (repudiation, deals, parental abductions ...), traditions
(genital mutilation ...). The implementation of the family law of the country of origin, imposed by law
international, is also often harmful to women.
For Ecolo, should:
to maintain a policy of "positive discrimination" against migrant women
to help them better understand and meet these challenges and to consider
as key actors of a rich and harmonious intercultural society; the
economic empowerment of migrant women is an essential element
improving their situation in Belgium and in Europe;
to support the associations of migrant women remain the main interlocutors
when they lead field work and often have privileged contact
migrant women (at the neighborhood level, common language ...);
Belgium ratifies and quickly implement the Convention of the Council of Europe
on the prevention and fight against violence against women and violence
domesticated. Indeed, migrant women in the context of family reunification or
undocumented, are particularly powerless in the face of domestic violence: in
case of filing a complaint, they risk immediate deportation. The Convention provides
including women victims of domestic violence whose residence status
dependent on their spouse are protected against refoulement so that they
can make an independent application for a residence permit. Furthermore,
collaboration with the Secretariat of State for Immigration, it is appropriate to adopt a protocol
to the attention of police services so that victims of violence who are undocumented
can seek help without fear of being reported to the authorities of
the immigration35;
to inform migrant women of their rights and existing services, ensure access to
information (on the labor market, access to health, etc.), including using tools
in several languages ​​and in cooperation with migrant organizations;
guarantee access to protection and justice for all women, including migrant women,
unrestricted, regardless of their marital status, and this principle into
European and international texts;
strengthen European funding to women's organizations and migrants
Belgium and other EU countries, including projects that lead on
based violence and remove the financing condition for third-country nationals
lawfully resident;
take better account of the needs of elderly immigrant order
they enjoy the same services as other seniors. Some immigrant women
are indeed particularly isolated, especially when the death occurs
spouse or a possible deterioration in their health. They are left without
contact with the outside, never having worked and often not one of mastering
national languages.

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter EQUALITY MEN-WOMEN - p 19/22 Proposal: Allier gender and sustainable development policies
cooperation
Ecolo intends to strengthen the mainstreaming of gender equality and sustainable development
in Belgian cooperation policy. To this end, it should:
to ensure that at least half of the additional resources for aid
development in the coming years to have real relevance and impact in the field
gender equality;
to legally adopt assorted targets gender-specific impact indicators and
qualitative indicators of programs and projects funded by cooperation;
strengthen the view instances on the full inclusion of gender in
cooperation policies, to ensure consistency across the board;
develop specific programs to support the strengthening of organizations and
women's associations, in the South and in the North.
Women in developing countries work in general for wages very
low - when paid - and especially in the informal sector, even though it is
they who bear a disproportionate burden of financial risk. They play a role
managers of household finances, in a context where social safety nets and
protection of the poor are absent or inadequate. They do not have access to
secure means of production and especially have very little access to land. This limits their
recognition as fundamental actors of food security in the context of a
family farming that Belgian Cooperation has pledged to support.
On the other hand, face the many conservative currents that threaten women's rights
to decide their sexual and reproductive lives, it should pay particular attention to
financing of programs aimed at strengthening, in partner countries, sex education,
access to information and effective contraception for all.
Proposal: Strengthen the role of women in decision making
For Ecolo, it should include:
to strengthen the presence of women in local decision-making bodies, national,
regional and international, as well as key positions (President of the Commission
European, Secretariat of the United Nations, etc.);
to grant specific support and strengthened the ratification and implementation of
Protocol on Women's Rights, adopted by the African Union, which represents progress
remarkable in the recognition of women's rights and their alignment
international goals;
to ensure the implementation of the National Action Plan 'Women, Peace and Security' (2013 2016) on the implementation of resolution 1325 of the UN Security Council
and :
-
its follow-up with civil society;
-
strengthening in this way the fight against sexual violence and rape against
regarded as a war crime;
-
to broadening the participation of women in the prevention and resolution
conflict and the consolidation of peace. Indeed, the impact of war on
women is well established, hence the importance of their participation in the
United Nations peacekeeping operations;
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter EQUALITY MEN-WOMEN - p 20/22 to allocate sufficient financial and human resources to the actors (UN, NGOs,
governments, etc.) present on site to be able to monitor (access to
justice, community reintegration ...) and assistance (medical and
... psychological) appropriate to victims of sexual violence. An information work,
Prevention and long-term monitoring should be further continued and extended to
educate local communities and authorities and armed groups;
ensure post-conflict monitoring as violence, including sexual, do not stop
with a cease-fire or peace; This trend is reinforced by the rest
myth that sex with a virgin can prevent or cure AIDS;
to support and promote the role of civil society in general and movements
women in particular to strengthen the voice and action of women;
to exert more pressure on the governments of countries affected by this scourge to
they put an end to the impunity that those responsible for such crimes receive and carry
up an effective judicial system.

LIVE TOGETHER
An intercultural society
Status and political horizon
State of play
The studies1 show that at equal level of training, foreigners or persons of origin
foreign are more affected by unemployment or find themselves in bad jobs
Quality (part-time, overqualified, etc.) 2. Everyone agrees also mean that
employment is the best path to successful integration, to the benefit of both the host society
and the foreign person or foreign origin. Moreover, besides the importance of the development
via personal work, having a job is also crucial in the context of reducing
poverty, the contribution to the economy and to social security and finally to social cohesion. The
look that carries the host society about people arriving is strongly influenced by the
Having a job or not.
But it's not only in access to employment discrimination that exist: housing,
training, access to information, culture, etc. are also areas where there is to
many obstacles for foreigners or persons of foreign origin.
The various phenomena of discrimination, stigmatization of specific groups, may
have the effect that the ethnic, religious, cultural, etc. who feel excluded
and / or who are excluded from society "majority" can not fully participate in the
construction of an emancipatory society. The withdrawal, on its first membership group
so often seems inevitable to some.
However, the dynamism of associations and many people of immigrant
show that there is a genuine desire not to be locked in a victimhood role and work
for the defense of equal rights and the fight against all forms of discrimination.
This work must be encouraged by the political world that claims to be anti-racism. Almost all
EU countries now have MPs from the far right and the social crisis
Economic and we know amplified this phenomenon. These parties often openly
racist but also several conservative parties now resume as the speeches
themes of the extreme right hardest. The spread of these ideas, in spite of laws
national, European and international that aim to fight against racism, become
behavior, insults and violence. In almost all European countries, the number of
offenses is hausse3.

For foreign women of foreign origin (mainly Turkish and Moroccan), the unemployment rate is still
higher. The rate of the Belgians "native" and European was 18%. In the case of Moroccan and
Turkey the percentage of unemployed youth reached 40% (Vertommen, "Ethnical topography of the Belgian labor
market. Employment, gender, age and ethnicity ", ULB, KUL, FRB, 2006).

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter LIVING TOGETHER - p 1/13 The political horizon Ecolo
Ecolo reaffirms its determination to meet the challenge of interculturalité4, to recognize and value the
diversity of cultures and lifestyles. It is not a question of promoting the separate development
cultures and policies that lead to it. This is to ensure the participation of each and
each in the construction of society.
One of the essential conditions for the existence of this society and democracy, the
fulfillment by each State and the base represented the Universal Declaration of Rights
Rights - including fundamental freedoms and equality man-woman - and respect
principle of strict separation between the State and all belief, whether religious or not. It is necessary,
within this framework, allowing the organization of worship on an equal footing and without the influence of countries
original.
At a time when no reaffirms its values ​​to exclude the other, we must also reaffirm
ours.
Ecolo promotes individual autonomy while resolutely part of a dimension
collective. Autonomy is the power to define its values ​​and choice of lifestyle. But we
want to encourage living together, that is to say the construction of a common world, from
relations between different and equal individuals. There is no individual without society, as there is no
society without individuals. The recognition of individuals in their singularity allows everyone
feel heard, understood in its complexities, its many facets and differences and,
therefore makes it possible and constructive dialogue.
Collectively, this recognition covers a series of symbolic aspects: access to
public speaking, balanced representation of the different components of society, right
live in public space its uniqueness and identity.
An open, inclusive, where everyone and each is enriched by the differences and
complementarities of others: this is the objective of environmentalists. To achieve this, we
convinced that the encounter and dialogue are the best tools. A dialogue in which everyone
agree on the basic values ​​of coexistence and democracy.
Without naivety and aware of the magnitude of the challenges, we know that dialogue,
meeting, fraternity are not given. It is often a challenge to the facility
irresponsible which consists in feeding the fear of the other and the instincts of decline and distrust.
Making the challenge of inclusion, we take advantage of loyalty to our values ​​and our fighting,
the party of courage and responsibility.
Policy levers to enable everyone to find their place in society and facilitate
Then the encounter with the other are numerous: the emancipation through education and school access
decent jobs, housing access, sharing and access to culture, etc.5 They are the basis of
all work against the rejection of the other and isolationism. All these aspects must be
priority when it comes to show that everyone can find their place in our society.
Ecolo believes that it is also promoting associative dynamic, rich, multifaceted work that
recognition of diversity should be conducted. This requires a cross coordination between
the various actors and appropriate funding so that community associations (not
"Communitarian"!) Can exist. This also helps to provide the political power
recognized and legitimate interlocutors and make a true place to otherness to create together
a common project.
Working for an open, inclusive society, which is enriched complementarities, as it happens
through access to equal rights for every woman and man living in our society. The
respect for the equality of everyone, fundamental freedoms and non-discrimination are

Interculturalism is the meeting of several cultures. On the contrary, multiculturalism assumes that there are several
crops but these do not automatically come together.

For more information, see the various thematic chapters.
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter LIVING TOGETHER - p 2/13 prerequisite of any community that wants to organize living together in a positive way. The
different forms of racism must be combated.
The main points of the Ecolo project for an intercultural society are:
-
Promote cultural diversity
-
Fight against discrimination and act for integration
-
Strengthen the fight against all forms of racism
Organizing the exercise of the right to wear a religious symbol or philosophical
equal treatment between religions and philosophical movements
Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: RECOGNIZE CULTURAL DIVERSITY
Proposal: Promote recognition of associations
You can rent the associative richness of our country: many associations are created and the
work they do reinforce social ties between citizens. However, all may not
rely solely on volunteer work. Some therefore end up back in the criteria
that achieve a structural subsidy (youth, continuing education,
social cohesion, etc.) and others, voluntarily or not, do not fit within this framework.
This is the case in many community associations (organizing inclusive projects with
neighbors, other associations, etc.), which, despite an often work recognized, are not entitled to
no financial aid since they relate to any traditional pillars of Belgian society and
since the French side, it does not yet recognize the organization of "minorities" in itself.
It is therefore appropriate to consider a census and an objective evaluation of these initiatives
community to consider supporting policy dialogue to promote their work and
the emancipation of their members.
For Ecolo, this recognition also involves a cultural representation in emissions
radio stations, cultural centers, etc. but also through the opening of a museum of immigration.
Proposal: Create a Diversity Forum
Flanders has, for several years, so very proactive, organized the reception of
Foreign persons and the recognition of a structured and transversal minorities. The
minderhedenforum6 provides communication with the target groups and their organizations as well
their involvement in the political minority. From its independent position, it follows the
Flemish integration policy. While there is obviously not perfect, but it should be in
inspire.
Indeed, these issues can not be dealt with politically, as has been too often
the Brussels and Walloon side, by the dispersion or dusting the means or the
recognition of ethnic or cultural associations without proper context other than good
willingness or near the regulator.
6
In agreement with the Commission's report of Intercultural Dialogue (2005) and one of Audience interculturalism (2010)
and in phase with the Flemish anti-racist movement. Note that there is already a "Migrant Forum", but that deals
more specifically issues related to migration. However, it seems necessary to include this in our forum
Proposal diversity forum.
Ecolo 2014 program - book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter LIVING TOGETHER - 3/13 p Ecolo is to create a similar instance in Minderhedenforum, a dome of
associations representing the various minorities and an interface between the different
associative components and governments. This is by structuring and recognizing these
initiatives that governments have credible and effective partners to consider and
refine the various policies with these audiences.
This structural approach must also allow the exchange of expertise, information,
identifying needs, creating initiatives mixing members of associations
representative of minorities and other associations.
Proposal: Revisiting regularly issues of living together
Ecolo wants the establishment, every 5 years, for a broad exchange between different
components of Belgian society (civil society, unions, forums of diversity ...), around
multiple questions posed by the encounter between different cultures. The meeting, organized
regular, public and transparent objectives would assess and analyze
intercultural issues and make recommendations to various levels of power,
on how a board of opinions classic.
Proposal: Hire a working memory and recognition with
former colonies
Belgium has a singular history and ties with several countries in Central Africa. Whether
individual or institutional level, it is still sometimes sensible to address the issue of
colonization of these countries. However, many Belgian and migrants (from DRC, Rwanda, Burundi ...)
and who live in Belgium, do not feel understood or recognized in the way presented
the history of Belgian colonization.
Ecolo proposes the establishment of a committee of Belgian and African historians in the goal
to prepare a report on the colonial period in which parliament will consider to base
recognition of the colonial past. The working memory is indeed important to conduct both
for individuals and for groups, because to build a common future, we must dare address
this common past. A critical historical work on the colonial question must be conducted to
allow new generations to understand their history. Thus, a transversal work must
be considered in schools - especially in the teaching of history - associations,
cultural spaces and museums.

Moreover, in Belgium, heritage reflects a history of the ideology of an era and bears
So a message that is not neutral. To restore the historical facts associated with heritage,
monuments must be accompanied by an explanation of the context making the critical analysis of
roles for these periods.

Proposal: Promote the encounter and dialogue
Governments can put in place many policies to encourage
intercultural dialogue, defending the fundamental principles or intervene through justice, if
breach of the law. But the majority of intercultural issues arising between individuals - a
local level, at the scale of a company of a group - and can often be resolved by the
dialogue.
For many citizens, conviviality and exchange are the things that matter in life
everyday but may also quickly be undermined because of misunderstandings or
reciprocal prejudices. A simple dialogue is often enough to remove misunderstandings and
reconcile differences. But it is still necessary that the conditions for dialogue are met.

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter LIVING TOGETHER - p 4/13

Ecolo therefore wishes to encourage the emergence of intercultural mediators in municipalities,
schools, businesses, public places, etc. This does not necessarily staff
but further train the existing staff. In the same vein, wants Ecolo
also establish a dialogue framework to local actors to calmly deal with
intercultural issues. This is to facilitate the ability of local players to consider for themselves the applications to take diversity into account, discuss them, to accept them,
a compromise or deny if the practical consequences they engender are
unacceptable or they come into tension with certain principles. Today, in the absence of
procedures for dialogue, such requests may be perceived as claims
inappropriate, and their refusal as a form of intolerance.
In the same logic, we believe that future policiers7, teachers, lawyers, assistants
social, etc. should receive training in interculturalism in their respective curricula.

PRIORITY 2: FIGHTING DISCRIMINATION AND ACTING FOR THE INTEGRATION
Gender equality is far from being a reality in Belgium: social inequalities add
series of discrimination on the basis of the supposed race, religion, culture, etc. They
result in access to employment difficulties, to adequate housing or to the premises or
entertainment moments.
In the field of employment, a person of foreign origin is more likely to be without
employment. Note the double discrimination faced by foreign women whose rate of
Unemployment is highest.
But discrimination remains difficult to establish. Any public policy action that is intended
must begin with effective diagnosis and based on a concrete assessment of the
location, not on impressions or testimony. An objective view of the situation made
currently lacking in Belgium. It is therefore appropriate to establish a measurement tool
discrimination related to the origin and not on nationality, since many people
Belgian nationality but of foreign origin are victims of discrimination.

Proposal: To adopt a directive on discrimination
At European level, there is currently a "race" directive 8, which prohibits racial discrimination
both in the field of employment, goods and services and a directive that prohibits emploi9
discrimination on grounds of age, disability, religious and philosophical convictions and
sexual orientation.
Therefore, there is no directive that explicitly prohibits discrimination based on age,
disability, philosophical and religious beliefs or sexual orientation in the field
goods and services (housing, transport, banking and insurance, leisure, ... HORECA). A
'horizontal' directive should include such forms of discrimination.
The Belgian legal system, based on the Anti-Discrimination Act of 10 May 2007 and decrees,
already covers the prohibition of discrimination in goods and services and for all
protected criteria. It goes further than the EU prescribed. However, the adoption of a Directive
Horizontal interest to Belgium. Indeed, this provision would apply to the
Court of Justice of the European Union in order to ask questions and
obtain policy decisions in discrimination cases.

7
Currently, the police may, on a voluntary basis and with the agreement of their leader, undergo diversity training.
Ecolo estimates that at least one person per policy area should have completed this training.

2000/43.

2000/78.

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter LIVING TOGETHER - p 5/13

Proposal: To evaluate the anti-discrimination law
The law of 10 May 2007 to fight against certain forms of discrimination is an important tool in
Belgian legislative arsenal. It prohibits discrimination based on age, sexual orientation, status
Civil, birth, wealth, religion or belief, political belief,
union conviction, language, current or future state of health, disability, characteristic
physical or genetic or social origin.
The law provides for an assessment of its implementation and its effectiveness, which never took place.
For Ecolo, the expert assessment is needed to effectively fight against
discrimination and ensure the adequacy of the legal framework with the ground truth.

Proposal: Develop and use the originally statistics
Cultural
To measure this discrimination, establish corrections and assess the effectiveness of
policies, the provision of discrimination objectification of tools is indispensable, while
preserving the principles of confidentiality and respect for privacy. Ecolo and advocates the use
the use of statistics on the cultural background of people (called "statistical
ethnic "or" cultural ") in the field of education and employment (both in hiring
as in the professional career) 10.
Ecolo also intends to extend the use of simulation tests currently used in some
because of their complexity (it takes two people who all common features, unless
potentially relevant factor) and the absence of structures that have the means to achieve them.

Proposal: Build a real home course for
newcomers
People arriving in Belgium today are faced with complexity
institutional and administrative. They generally ignore the social devices, and
their rights and responsibilities. This slows or even prevents the process
integration. The lack of knowledge of national language-related difficulties facing the
the labor market is another obstacle in the path to be undertaken by
migrants.
There are still obstacles to life, to work, to political participation for migrants
residing in Europe. Within the OECD, Belgium is one of the countries where disparities
the labor market between immigrants and nationals are the most important. The employment rate
is lower than the Belgians and higher unemployment rates. Migrants are also
over-represented in so-called precarious jobs and worker employment. If the employment problems
obviously cover the specific characteristics, especially in a downturn
Economic, it seems obvious that the person who has just arrived, who does not know the
language and who does not apprehend the life-related codes in Belgium combine the obstacles before
to get a job, to be socially and financially autonomous.

In its report of January 2013 on discrimination, IWEPS recommended this measure because "this precious source
Statistical requires improvement through the consideration of additional variables, not now
available, such as the country of birth of individuals, their level of education, place of graduation, duration
stay on Belgian territory regarding immigrants and foreign workers, mastery of languages,
occupational category of parents and their place of birth. These individual characteristics are essential
to identify the determinants the disadvantage of certain groups in the labor market and evaluate
the extent of discrimination against foreigners, "in" Study on discrimination in Belgium and
Wallonia: analysis of positions on the labor market according to gender and nationality, "IWEPS, in January 2013.

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter LIVING TOGETHER - p 6/13

Ecolo calls for a real journey of structuré11 home and built on the logic of education
permed. This course must be an opportunity for recognition by society and migrants
aim for a full involvement of migrants in it. It can not be considered
as a device that would be a comprehensive and definitive answer to the problems related to home
migrants.
The reception, integration within a society is a long and complex process that requires
will and resources of all parties: the migrant, the government but also the society
whole.
For home course, we mean an interactive process in which the authorities
offer migrants a specific individualized program to strengthen their
autonomy through individual coaching, language lessons and citizenship classes. The
while focusing on active teaching and peer education when possible.
To achieve a path that actually meets the needs of both new arrivals as the
host society, particularly Ecolo wishes:
that the work of development of these policies is also built with associations
of migrants, who are of an experience in this field;
that resources are in line with the expected objectives;
that citizen and intercultural dimension is at the center of the device;
avoid as much at the level of access to host courses, related discrimination
status and origin of migrants;
ensure maximum consistency in the route between the three regions - both in
target public as educational objectives related to content).

Proposal: Promote learning of languages ​​of origin and open these courses
at each
During the original languages ​​(LCO Program) exist. Ecolo wants to explore the trail of
strengthening the languages ​​of origin of foreign pupils when it is proven that this
Learning easier than other languages ​​(French, Dutch ...). The reinforcement of
overall language skills also enable more successful school career and
remove one of the obstacles to discrimination.
These courses should not be limited to persons of foreign origin but may justly
become mixed sites.
In parallel, Ecolo will strengthen learning the official languages ​​of Belgium (whose
During French foreign language FLE) with the newcomers and the general population.

Proposal: Improve procedures equivalency of foreign qualifications
Request a diploma equivalence, to seek employment, pursue studies or
Training is a complicated process, long and expensive in Belgium francophone12. In addition to the
amount required to introduce its application package (from 124 €), the decisions do
not always possible to understand how they were taken.

11
According to the definition of the Centre for Equal Opportunities "an appropriate policy of welcoming newcomers should aim at
that they participate optimally in society in all its facets: housing, employment, education,
services, leisure [...], right to expression [...] ".
12
Now, on the side of the Flemish Community, the application shall also pay equity but some
social categories are exempt.

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter LIVING TOGETHER - p 7/13

It is therefore necessary to reduce the cost of this application, at least for benefit recipients
or unemployment insurance recipients and make public the expert reports on the state
education which are based on the recognition of equivalence or not. He appears
also essential that people can get quick answers, transparent,
properly justified and that all required original documents are returned in the end
procedure.
Finally, it should also improve consistency positions between Flanders and
Wallonia.

Proposal: Allow access to public employment to all nationalities
Ecolo also wants public services jobs of all levels
to be open to all nationalities, including those who are nationals of a country
non member of the European Union, as is already the case in the Brussels region, Wallonia and
Federation Wallonia-Brussels (including in education), through the work of Ecolo.
Under European law, this openness applies to jobs that do not involve
direct or indirect participation in the exercise of public powers and functions which do not have
to safeguard the general interests of the State or of other public authorities.

Proposal: Deploy utility reflecting the diversity
Ecolo considers that public authorities should be a reference in their role
employers, particularly in terms of openness to cultural diversity. In this context, Ecolo
supports in particular:
The development of a diversified administration, representative of its users, by
establishment of a human resources management policy that is in line
respecting differences and seeking to enrich these differences. Like what
was driven by environmentalists Ministers during this legislature in administrations
Regional Walloon and Brussels and in Wallonia-Brussels wants Ecolo
all public service vocation better reflect the pluralistic composition of the company
the development plans of actions against discrimination and promoting
diversity ;
Awareness in all the workings of the civil service, greater integration
of foreigners or persons of foreign origin, both in their capacity as users
actors of public services.

Proposal: Evaluate and extend the right to vote of non-European foreigners
Registration of foreigners on the lists of electors is a democratic issue and
significant citizenship. The participation of European and non-European foreigners in elections
Communal 2012 was weak, despite the information and awareness campaigns. A
further assessment should be conducted to better understand the barriers to engagement.
Ecolo wish enlargement of foreign voting resident for at least 5 years
Belgium, other levels of pouvoirs13.

Proposal: To ensure equal citizenship for our citizens abroad
Today, citizens are incarcerated in their home countries where their human rights
are violated and that, in the indifference of Belgian diplomatic and consular authorities. Of
Belgian women undergo in their country of origin, discriminatory family laws, following
a marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption without the Belgian authorities assist
in their efforts.
The diplomatic and consular authorities invoke dual nationality of these nationals
do not wear their assistance. But when a Belgian citizen - who has no double
nationality - was convicted and imprisoned in a third country, Belgium intervenes diplomatically
to ensure respect for fundamental rights.
The indifference of the Belgian authorities with regard to their own nationals caused by home
many Belgians the feeling of being, in fact, second-class citizens. For Ecolo, the doublenationalité can in no way be considered a semi-citizenship. Reaffirms Ecolo
therefore strongly equality of citizens regardless of their origin, religion or
philosophical conviction. Everyone should have equal access to the enjoyment of rights - including
that consular assistance - and freedoms. Ecolo requires a diplomatic authorities
immediate consular assistance to our citizens imprisoned in violation of their
fundamental rights.

PRIORITY 3: STRENGTHENING THE FIGHT AGAINST ALL FORMS OF RACISM
Racism is to match general or specific negative characteristics to a
group. This takes the form of unequal treatment, abuse and insults, which
hit whole groups. It is these minorities who are discriminated against - each according to
specific dynamics - and not mere individuals. For Ecolo, the recognition of minorities
ethnocultural involved the necessary overhaul of anti-racism. The promotion of living
together and diversity is obviously necessary but not sufficient for poverty
racism.
Ecolo has always fought against racism and notes that it tends to grow
alarming in times of crisis. It spreads parallel to the growth of inequality
in our society. Every day, citizens of immigrant origin are experiencing
humiliation and contempt by their mere appearance. The failure of the social ladder in
Popular neighborhoods added to this daily contempt provokes in many people a
feeling of revolt which can result in some cases by some form of community withdrawal.
The fight against racism and discrimination can not be sidelined. Ecolo hears
wear forehead social justice and the fight against racism.

Proposal: Organize a Interfederal Action Plan to fight against
racism
Many researches and reports of the Centre for Equal Opportunities and the Fight
against Racism (CECLCR) demonstrate that racial discrimination, racism, based on inequality
origin or nationality are still realities and addressing them requires
coordonnée14 and concerted approach.

14

These are also the conclusions of the World Conference against Racism in Durban in 2001 and the Conference
Review of Geneva in 2009, which recommended that States adopt a national struggle against racism plan.

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter LIVING TOGETHER - p 9/13

It is in this spirit qu'Ecolo proposes the adoption of a Plan of Action Interfederal fight against
racism. The fight against racism must be on the agenda of all governments and
conduct in consultation with civil society actors and field.

Proposal: Support associations fighting against racism
The dispersion of resources and the difficulty of obtaining fails to conduct a critical battle
racism. An overhaul of anti-racism can do without thinking about the actors
the fight against racism. The fight against racism has long been driven by sectors
Progressives of the Belgian company. Ecolo has contributed since its inception. However, we believe
it is now imperative to include in the various control devices against the racism
people of immigrant. The first victims of racism must also be actors
of their own emancipation. For converging all the positive forces, it is essential to
pilarisée exceed the traditional associative structure.

Proposal: Guarantee freedom of expression, fight
against the (cyber) hate
Ecolo strongly refuses the idea of ​​a hierarchy of racisms. Different forms of racism
must be tackled head on.
However, next to anti-Semitism is needed more than ever, continue to fight, was
developed Islamophobia (or anti-Muslim racism). They rely on racist speech more
more liberated and dangerous for social cohesion. Besides concrete actions and
systematization of law enforcement against racism and xenophobia, it is necessary to
supporting neighborhood associations.
Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that for Ecolo, the criticism of religion or politics a
Foreign State can not automatically be equated with racism. Moreover, the fight against
Racism should not restrict the principle of freedom of expression.
The phenomenon of cyber-hatred grows également15. If it is difficult to act on the content of
some sites, the responsibilities of hosts, moderators, etc. do exist in law
Belgian. It is therefore necessary to continue the various awareness campaigns and
information, particularly for them, but also the general public.

PRIORITY 4: ORGANIZE THE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT SIGNS OF WEAR RELIGIOUS
PHILOSOPHICAL AND OR EQUAL TREATMENT AND THE WORSHIP
PHILOSOPHICAL MOVEMENTS

Proposal: To organize the exercise of the right to wear a religious symbol or
philosophical
The issue of religious or philosophical signs is particularly complex and sensitive. In
particular, the question of the Islamic headscarf in recent years seems to crystallize all
tensions and misunderstandings related to cultural and religious difference. Ecolo offers
to understand this problem in a spirit of respect for the law, openness and compromise, true
15

The CECLCR recalls that only "the statements that incite others to hatred, violence or discrimination
according to the criteria protected by law, constitute a prosecutable offense. The Holocaust denial are
also punishable by law. "

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter LIVING TOGETHER - p 10/13

democratic values ​​and fundamental freedoms that must be constantly reaffirmed,
so intransigent against all forms of radicalism.
Ecolo is fully consistent with the principles of individual freedom, religious freedom and equality
equality guaranteed by the Belgian Constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights
rights and international conventions, as regards the wearing of religious signs and
philosophical, especially scarves. Ecolo wants people who do
choice to wear a headscarf are not considered a priori incapable persons and
subject, which should withdraw to prove their ability to be full citizens
officials.
An outright ban so would bring no response to the questions and challenges
would, however, lead to a situation of exclusion and withdrawal. In addition, it
put our country in breach of the international instruments that protect the rights
fundamentals. However, it should consider how to organize the exercise of this right in
specific contexts of school and public services.
At school
The school must be primarily a place of inclusion and learning of emancipation. It should
Furthermore fight against any form of ghettoization. In this context, wishes to support the Ecolo
free choice or not wear a sign convictionnel once the or youth is able to
ask freely. The notion of "discernment" therefore entails a prohibition
wearing a sign convictionnel in primary education and in teaching
secondary to a level of education should be defined collectively through
the obligation to comply with the defined rules.
This authorization does not hinder monitoring of schooling. It remains a right and an
obligation for everyone, and in full. There is therefore no question of authorizing the
non-attendance of certain courses (science courses, physisque education), or to adopt
attitudes that go against living together (rejection of diversity), nor authorize any
proselytizing attitude.
Meanwhile, Ecolo condemns any pressure to what a young wearing a philosophical sign
or religious against his will. Any young must denounce these pressures and be protected.
Some services (mediation, AMO, family planning centers ...) have the capacity
allowing for dialogue within a family. One of the school's role is to inform
young people of the existence of such services.
In the public service
Ecolo does not oppose the principle of religious freedom to the obligation of neutrality
service to the citizen by a public official. The neutrality guarantees the citizen to be treated without
discrimination including its ideological or philosophical convictions.
Subject to compliance with certain conditions, neutrality and impartiality in the public service
however, are not incompatible with the principles of freedom of expression and religion. To
Rather, according to the case law of the European Convention on Human Rights,
a general ban on wearing religious or philosophical signs in the public service
appears excessive in light of constitutional rights and certainly represent a
Discrimination additional hiring for women who often suffer too. he

should justify the ban by a concrete evaluation functions.
Ecolo supports the ban on wearing convictional signs for trades invested a function
or role of authority to the public or a section of the public (police, justice, army,
teachers ...), since it must ensure impartiality but also the appearance of impartiality
public service so that staff carrying signs arouse convictional
not with the public feel that they do not exercise their function impartially.
Ecolo 2014 program - book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter LIVING TOGETHER - p 11/13 In parliamentary assemblies, provincial councils, municipal and CPAS
If there is indeed a place where one reaches thanks to his convictions, are the assemblies. Legislate
prohibit the wearing of any convictionnel sign in an elected assembly therefore seems inconsistent
and in contradiction with the European case law on fundamental freedoms.
Proposal: Achieving equal treatment between cults and
philosophical movements
We can refer continually state neutrality without ensuring that there is a treatment
equal of it against recognized religions. Since cults meet expectations
Constitution about the religions and philosophies, for Ecolo, they should be treated as
Other religions recognized and organized secularism with equal rights and duties.
Ecolo wants to reform the current system of financing religions to address all
confessional and non-confessional communities equally. In this sense, is Ecolo
favorable to an anonymous consultation carried out every five years; the result of the investigation establish
the relative importance of each religious or philosophical movement.
Also, as it is possible for different Christian be recognized currents
specifically (Catholic religion, Orthodox Christianity, Protestant worship, Anglican), Ecolo
wishes to evaluate the possibility of recognizing the diversity of other faiths as they
meet the conditions of the law.
Moreover, Buddhism is still not recognized in Belgium. Ecolo wants the process
to full recognition is finalized.
Finally, in the Brussels region, Ecolo has made it possible to be buried without a coffin in the ground.
This possibility must also be extended in Wallonia.
Proposal: Develop an Islam of Belgium
Ecolo wants to build an Islam of Belgium self-organized by the confession of citizens
Muslim, without interference or state or foreign institutions, governmental or not.
In recent years, the federal government - through the Ministers of Justice
Successive - chose to encourage the outsourcing of the management of Islam embassies
Foreign. We must break with this dangerous logic of external influences. Muslims
are mostly Belgian citizens, it should enable them to organize their worship from
realities they live every day, that is to say, those of their society, the Belgian company.
In full respect of the neutrality of the state and of political non-interference in the affairs
religious, progressive forces want to build a Belgian Muslim Executive of
Belgium. This must be done by ensuring representation of women, youth and
ethnic and religious minorities to Islam, currently absent from the direction of the Executive.
Ecolo wants to allow the formation of imams in Belgium, imams who master one of
national languages ​​and are aware of the realities of believers. Otherwise, mosques
will have no choice but to resort to Belgian imams disconnected realities.
Finally, today too few mosques are recognized by the government for a series of
reasons. In collaboration with associations and persons concerned, the legal framework must
be evaluated and improved in order to avoid administrative delays as they are known
today.

LGBTQI
An inclusive society for minorities
affective orientations, sexual and gender
Status and political horizon
State of play
Belgium is a country where the rights of lesbians, gay, bisexual, trans, queer and intersex
(LGBTQI) 1 are in constant progression. When compared to other European countries, its
Legislation is one of the most advanced in terms of equal rights.2. If marier3 for example,
have children or adopt has become possible, thanks to the action of environmentalists,
which have always been a driving force on these issues.
Yet insults, discrimination and homophobic violence seem augmentation4. A
obviously worrying increase, the politicians, the various levels of
authorities must take measures to provide strong responses in the short and long term.
The figures also show that both society and individuals recognize more easily
violence against LGBTQI people. Because now, homophobic offenses can
be recognized as such and because, even if the reception and information in
police still need to be improved in some respects, victims are less afraid of
file a complaint, either with the police or the Centre for Equal Opportunities and the Fight
against Racism (CECLCR). This finding should not overshadow the feeling of insecurity, which seems
particularly high among LGBTQI, and the progress still to be made in this regard.
Beyond the violence and discrimination committed by individuals against other
people, there are also institutional violence: ban on homosexuals giving them
blood or medical and psychological obligations imposed by law for persons wishing to
change sex, administrative difficulties related thereto or discrimination between parents. If the
Belgium is one of the most advanced in terms of equal rights for the country, not for
provided it is nothing left to do. On the contrary.
In 2013, the Federal Government has launched two action plans against interfédéraux,
respectively violence and homophobic and transphobic discrimination. If these plans
shares moving in the right direction by the objectives and the priorities they set out, it remains
still much to do to fully achieve equal rights.
Furthermore, the figures do not allow to assess whether the differences related to sexual orientation
or gender are generally better accepted today within the Belgian population
before. This acceptance, the phenomenon of "normalization" of LGBTQI people will
1
We use the acronym LGBTIQ because it helps to have a political vision on all the different orientations
existing.
2
With the exception, perhaps, of transgender people.
3
There are nearly 1000 marriages of homosexuals and lesbians couples per year in Belgium since the adoption of the law allowing
marriage for same-sex (Law of 1 June 2003).
4
The Centre for Equal Opportunities and the Fight against Racism wrote in his report "Discrimination / Diversity" of
In 2012 the number of reports related to sexual orientation had increased by 40% compared to 2011.
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter LGBTQI - 1/8 p possible over the long term by a work of information and awareness, and from the earliest
young age.
For years, Ecolo fights for the setting up of structural and widespread modules
education for social life, emotional and sexual (EVRAS) in schools. While everyone
everyone agrees on the difficulty for young people and particularly young LGBTQI good
their sexuality, this module is still not widespread. The findings of several
University studies have raised yet, in 2003, the need to raise awareness of issues of
sexuality and accompany young people more and earlier. This support is all the more
necessary that these studies point LGBTQI youth suicide rate above
the average.
Finally, at international level, violence against LGBTQI remain numerous. In 7
countries homosexuality is condemned to death. In 78 others, she is liable to a penalty
jail. The number of refugees seeking asylum applicants to Belgium for reasons of
homophobic violence in their country is increasing.
The political horizon Ecolo
The fight for equality Ecolo LGBTQI is in the political fight for equal
rights. Because what unites us is infinitely stronger than what separates us, wants Ecolo
implement all possible policies that sexual orientation and the question of
gender identity become standard subjects, who fears neither generate nor discharges or
violent reactions. Ecolo fights for a peaceful society, which is not afraid of differences, what
whether.
Ecolo also draws attention to the fact that the LGBTQI themes also refer to
multiple discrimination (women, foreigners ...) which increase exclusion. Therefore, it is
a transversal work that it is conducting, at all levels: school, associations, sports, neighborhood,
public policy, etc. and in collaboration with other minorities (visible or not).
The difficulties encountered LGBTQI also pose the issue more broadly - that affects all
the world - the place of sexuality in our society. If hypersexualisation became a
major phenomenon in our daily via advertising and the media, having a sexuality
blossomed, respectful and everyone is aware of the significance of his actions and behavior
seems fundamental: awareness and information play an important role.
Ecolo has always favored the work on the medium and long term, considering that a company
that progresses through education and understanding by everyone of the issues that concern them.
The aim therefore is to work Ecolo on information, awareness and prevention. Thanks to
strong policies in this sense, we will achieve a truly inclusive society. However,
government responsibility is also to allow a work penalty and justice
when violent or discriminatory behavior were committed.
Finally, facing the daily observation of violence against LGBTQI around the world, it is necessary
to conduct a proactive policy in terms of awareness of the rights of LGBTQI in
countries where homophobic laws unfortunately exist.
Ecolo force lines are therefore the following:
Fight against homophobic violence and discrimination
Develop advocacy work of all public
Work towards respecting the rights of LGBTQI internationally
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter LGBTQI - 2/8 p priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: COMBATING VIOLENCE AND HOMOPHOBIC
DISCRIMINATION
Proposal: To fight effectively against homophobic violence
The testimonies of insults and complaints and homophobic attacks, lesbophobes5 and transphobic
are increasing. More worryingly, according to the Center for Equal Opportunities and the Fight against
racism, it is mainly the case of homophobic violence, sometimes extreme, that increase. Yes
this aggravation also shows that victims are less and less afraid to complain
with the police, amplification of this phenomenon can not be ignored.
Violent or insulting behavior towards LGBTQI are not the prerogative of any public
specific. So there is a global awareness work to be done. As suggested below,
Ecolo believes that education modules in social life, emotional and sexual may
lead to better understanding of the different possibilities of relationships between individuals.
But this issue involves work with justice and police. All behaviors
abusive or insulting based on the difference (origin, gender, religion, orientation ...) must be
effectively prosecuted strong way. The joint circular to the College of Prosecutors
General and Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs in this direction. Nevertheless, its implementation
work must be assessed as it will be necessary to analyze the causes of the feeling
of insecurity among affected populations and preventing them to complain to find
levers to act on these causes.
Sanctions must be proportionate course but also, and this is important, the aim
understanding and repair (work in LGBTQI associations, meeting families
LGBTQIs, etc.).
Finally, Ecolo proposes to supplement Article 150 of the Constitution also for the offenses of
Press homophobic and sexist particular. This Article provides that press offenses
inspired by racism or xenophobia could be referred to the criminal court and not to the
foundations.
Proposal: To fight against discrimination based on sexual orientation
and gender identity
Much work remains to be done with the police and prosecution. It is essential
systematize awareness and diversity training in police schools about
the situation of LGBTQI (reception, processing complaints, attitude vis-à-vis LGBTQI colleagues
etc.) and during the career, in-service training of agents. It is important that this
approach be conducted in collaboration with specialists: associations, CECLCR,
associations LGBTQI police. It will be necessary to ensure the sustainability of such training and
their updates.
Ecolo also insists that the registration of complaints of discrimination against LGBTQI
be systematized and generalized. This recording should allow, on the one hand, treatment
adequacy of the complaint, and, secondly, a better record of statistical data.
5
Lesbophobia is a superposition of homophobia and sexism. We must also struggle against sexism to decrease
discrimination against lesbians.
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter LGBTQI - 3/8 p Ecolo requests that the Centre for Equal Opportunities and the Fight against Racism has
sufficient means to carry out its missions, anti-discrimination policies. It is the
even for the Institute for the Equality of Women and Men in the framework of identities and
gender expression.
In the regional and community public service, several "Diversity Plan" incorporating
including gender issues were also introduced by environmentalists Ministers. It is
essential that they are properly applied and that, in the long term. To do this, the roles of people
trust and safety advisers should be reinforced or strengthened.
Proposal: To have attention vis-à-vis lesbians
Ecolo intends to be attentive to the "lesbian invisibility". This phenomenon is especially by brand
a lesser presence in associations and places of homosexual encounter, sousreprésentativité lesbians in studies related to homosexuality and lack of
representations of lesbians in the media with the effect, among others, hinder
identity construction both individual and collective.
It should, for example, have special attention directed towards lesbians in
Investigation of risk transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and
in prevention campaigns where they are too often forgotten.
Aspects lesbophobia (see above) must be better analyzed and apprehended
including police training homophobic violence.
Proposal: Respect and facilitate individual choices
sex change
The 2007 law governing sex change imposes heavy steps
administrative and medical transgender. Ecolo filed in several resolutions
Meetings asking monitoring principles Yogyakarta6.
Ecolo want a quick change in the law, in dialogue with local players: the rules
Current impose the intervention of a multidisciplinary team, sterilization obligation and
followed by nursing and heavy steps very standardized. Ecolo wants to end
psychiatrization intersexes7 and transgender people. For Ecolo, it is primarily
the acceptance of individual courses and choice and simplification of administrative procedures, to
all levels (municipal, etc.) that must prevail in this matter.
In this logic, the administrative steps should not be more complicated for a
trans or intersex person: it is to be consistent with the equal rights of individuals.
Ecolo also wants an official identification document stating the personal data
Legal expression and (social) gender can be created for the "transition period"
(it is done completely or not) as this can cause difficulties during checks
Identity (police, airport, etc.).
Ecolo has, in the image of what is already done in other countries like Germany or Switzerland,
to remove the designation of sex on the identity card, and generally on the documents
ID. This statement is, first, not relevant in order to identify the holder of the
document. It is further confusing and can be a source of suffering for
people whose gender expression differs from the legal sex.
6
Principles concerning the application of human rights in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity.
One of the major problems of intersex people is the "surgical reassignment" and hormonal treatments
forced in intersex children, that is to say they do not have the right to choose (or not choose) what they want
be. They have no right to self-determination.
7
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter LGBTQI - 4/8 p Gender stereotypes do not poison the relations between men and women
but affect all persons whose gender identity does not fit gender norms
and binary. To be truly effective, gender equality policies should include the fight against
gender stereotypes.
Proposal: Allow blood donation and to fight against stereotypes
particularly in the world of health
It is first to allow gay and bisexual men to give them
blood. Despite the work of continuous parliamentary interpellation ecologists, blood donation
gay and bisexual men is still not allowed. Any person or heterosexual
not having homosexual risky behavior and that meets all health standards must
be allowed to help patients heal or survive, like any other donor.
Meanwhile, it is also to change the 'good practice recommendations' or
"Prescribers awareness campaigns" is currently available to physicians
both general INAMI by the Scientific Society of General Medicine (SGAM). These
suggest today not make systematic screening for STIs and STDs than in
"Men who have sex with." The future national plan against AIDS is based
scaffolded studies on a class of persons which does not include the entirety of the
realities "men who have sex with men." The studies
Epidemiological should consider the sexual behavior and practices at actual risk
(number of different partners, etc.) and not in a said suspected population category
"Homo" or "bi". Beyond the aspect extremely stigmatizing towards these people, so does
the effectiveness of a control plan, which should effectively be able to reach its target: all those and
all those who have unsafe sex.
Proposal: Allow access to the recognition procedure to establish the
co-parent the parentage
Currently, the companion of the mother giving birth to a child by Procreation Medically
Power (LDCs) must, to legally exist in the life of the child, carry the same route
a person who adopts a child: preparation, passing by the court, assessment
psychosocial, high fees.
Ecolo proposes to allow the co-parent to recognize the child or through recognition "on
belly "(before birth) or through the common recognition, like all parents.
PRIORITY 2: DEVELOPING THE WORK OF ALL PUBLIC AWARENESS
Proposal: Improve support for associations
Ecolo believes that support for the voluntary sector is crucial for several reasons. First of all,
because it helps to educate different audiences in different ways including on
issues of homosexuality and transsexuality. But it also provides an opportunity to make a
field prevention work to fight against homophobic acts and discrimination,
lesbophobic, transphobic.
Multiply and develop places of socialization for young people who wonder
questions about their orientation. Currently, these places are concentrated in some cities
and operate with limited resources.
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter LGBTQI - 5/8 p We also believe it is necessary to effectively support the associations that create
linking several minorities and struggling against multiple discrimination.
In the field of sports organizations, fight campaigns against discrimination
homophobic, transphobic and lesbophobic must be developed within and through
sports associations. It also requires that the federations concerned take strong sanctions
(demotion, radiation ...) against teams who refuse to compete against
LGBTQI teams. Any action or discriminatory insults with reference to sexual orientation or
gender identity during a sports event must be combated and punished.
Proposal: Generalizing education modules in social life, emotional
sexual and all students
For many years, Ecolo fights for modules on education
relational, emotional and sexual, that take into account gender differences and guidance,
be generalized to all the Federation Wallonia-Brussels education networks.
This would help youth awareness discriminations against LGBTQI and help
many young questioning about their identity and / or sexuelle8 orientation.
These themes must be integrated into the compulsory curriculum because they
also allow to conduct a necessary STD / STI prevention work, the number of
infections unfortunately decreasing pAS9.
It also appears important that schools develop, maintain and affirm a culture
Opening around sexual orientation. The insults and homophobic violence - evil
which is probably underestimated on the school premises now - must find answers
clear and teaching on the part of all education personnel.
In this same logic, spécifiques10 projects should be supported, strengthened and developed.
Gay volunteers, lesbians and bisexuals realize such s animations in
secondary schools. The goal is to demystify homosexuality and bisexuality and fight against
Homophobia at large. Stakeholders, coming testify also come meet
questions students ask themselves.
Moreover, LGBTQI youth are hyper represented in suicide statistics in
young people. Suicide prevention actions must take greater account of this reality and
appropriate responses must be proposed by the sectors concerned, in partnership with
LGBTQI youth associative.
Finally, and more generally, consider an awareness of the realities of life LGBTQI
in qualifying training courses for all players in the health and education11.
PRIORITY 3: WORKING TO RESPECT THE LAW OF THE PLAN LGBTQI
INTERNATIONAL
The number of countries where being a LGBTQI person is liable to sanctions or punishment of
discrimination of all kinds or forms of torture, remains impressive. The increase in
number of people seeking asylum in Belgium because of homophobia in their country
Original shows how the work for equal rights for LGBTQI at
8
In this context, specific training for players EVRAS will be established in collaboration with
LGBTQI associations.
9
Knowing that these modules must apply to everyone and not only for LGBTQI people.
10
Like, for example, the "GREY Wallonia" (Academic Intervention Group).
11

Support for research on LGBT issues (financing studies, research, support to exchange platforms
information …).
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter LGBTQI - 6/8 p international capital remains. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights makes no reference
explicit sexual orientation and gender identity, giving rise to interpretations
various on human rights and protection of the rights of LGBTQI people.
The Yogyakarta Principles on the application of international human rights in
sexual and gender identity policy adopted in 2006 thus constitute a universal guide
for the rights of LGBTQI and their protection. These principles are still too
unknown and should be adopted by all States to provide a reference
universal human rights and protections of persons.
The advance of Belgium in the field of rights of LGBTQI12, compared to other countries
European and even more compared to other parts of the world gives it
responsibility for developing and raising awareness of example in these matters.
As part of various development cooperation programs, Ecolo believes that,
Like what is happening more generally in relation to human rights, Belgium
should propose specific actions on the rights of LGBTQI.
At the level of the European Union, Belgium must also act for the rights of
LGBTQI in other Member States and for the recognition by them of Belgian law
for LGBTQI.

With the exception of discrimination experienced by transgender and intersex.

BIOETHICS
An open society respecting choices
each and every one
Status and political horizon
State of play
Every day, new scientific, technological and medical arise. If they are
encouraging, we still do not know whether these gains are accompanied ethical and moral progress
necessary and if it includes strong enough tags to overcome risks
the use of living.
When it comes to bioethics, one can not help wonder about the commercial excesses,
the impact on privacy and social life, the possible damage to human dignity
or the environment.
The way our society responds to these questions, collectively, politically, will
influence on the values ​​that are shared and carried within it. The tags that puts the company
development of bioethics are fundamental. Its development must be accompanied
real democratic strengthening and wider understanding of accessibility.
Indeed, the majority of these issues are related to values ​​or sensitivities that affect each
and each deep within himself. However, these developments may also arouse
distrust because of their technical complexity, scientific or medical, which makes the
comprehensive understanding of the very difficult issues for non-experts. The scientific world and
Medical therefore has a responsibility in this regard, especially as scientific developments and
development of science are constant. But the responsibility is shared by the world
policy to ensure that these issues can be discussed in an understandable way and
democratic by all those and all those who want it.
The political horizon of bioethics Ecolo
Given the diversity of possible technological trajectories, the authorities should organize
democratic debate taking into account their relevance for sustainable transition goal
our societies. Some technological options must be strengthened when they allow
women and men to live better, longer lasting, more peaceful and more
long. Others need to be abandoned or postponed, pursuant to the principles
prudence and caution. Moreover, fundamental ethical discussions must be
addressed in a non-dogmatic way.
Ecolo wishes to advance certain issues relating to ethical issues but also allow
every citizen and every citizen to better understand the issues. Advances
Progressives such as access to voluntary termination of pregnancy or euthanasia must be
reinforced and real democratic reflection is needed on issues such as
availability of genetic tests, the impact of nanotechnology, the right of the mother, the father and
the child in the event of unwanted birth or parents' rights in case of stillbirth.
Ecolo 2014 program - book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter BIOETHICS - 1/6 p The main points of the Ecolo project bioethics are:
Help people understand the scientific and technological developments as well
their impacts so choose, in the common interest, scientists and options
technology that must be strengthened and those to be slowed or stopped
Update and strengthen the law on abortion
Improve the framework of the law on euthanasia and physician education about the end of life
Oversee the availability of genetic testing
Strengthen laws regarding tissue banking, cell and cord
Better understand the impacts of nanotechnologies on health
Strengthen support for mothers in distress
Facilitate grieving parents who had a stillborn child
Provide a clear legal framework for surrogacy
Beyond these programmatic tags, which seeks to provide ECOLO consensus position
After extensive study, analysis and debate, it should nevertheless remember that it is left to
each elected full freedom of conscience on these ethical issues.
Proposals for Ecolo
Proposal: To help citizens better understand the scientific developments
and technology and their impacts
The ethical aspects of research should be explicitly considered in pregnant
adequate democratic. The developments presented as technical and therefore difficult
accessible to the greatest number, must be explained, as well as their contributions to the
company.
Given the constant evolution of science and technology should be regularly
put the debate developments in order, to ensure that advances in science go
hand in hand with the protection of fundamental human rights. This debate involves a
informed participation of the citizens, especially via a pluralistic public debate,
taking into account the state of knowledge, currents of thought, value systems,
historical contexts and cultural and philosophical and religious convictions.
Ecolo proposes the creation of processes that ensure democratic control research and
establishing ethical guidelines on technical progress. In this sense, intends Ecolo
prevent certain techniques are used for personal reasons or reasons
financial interests.
Proposal: Update and strengthen the law on abortion
For Ecolo, voluntary termination of pregnancy, the last resort for women who make it
free choice, which is an achievement in recent disposal which can not be questioned. The law of 4
April 1990 is a fundamental text to preserve the right of every woman to decide
freely whether to accept an unwanted pregnancy.
The law on abortion should however be updated based on assessments made so
especially :
To prohibit the misuse of the "center of IVG" label by centers who practice it
not ;
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter BIOETHICS - 2/6 p Consolidate resources allocated to family planning, today saturated by
demand in all of their missions;
Develop the media promoting the use of the "morning after pill";
Support women in abortion requests, which are not mutually order;
Improve data collection on the reasons for choosing abortion, on the background
Socioeconomic of the person and the number of weeks of pregnancy to
to improve prevention;
Ensure that the "conscience1 clause", which is a right of every doctor, do
become a brake on women's right to abortion;
Promote with Francophone universities introducing a training module
family planning and abortion in all medical schools, as well as various
contraceptive methods, including their cost-effectiveness.
Finally, emphasis should also be placed on the prevention of emotional and sexual life,
improve access to information and contraception, accompany women and couples who
wish. In this logic, one of the tracks qu'Ecolo is urgently wishes to materialize
Registration structurally EVRAS of modules within scolaire.2
Internationally, the Report of the UN Human Rights Committee (2011) recalled that
the right of access to abortion should be seen as part of human rights and
"That the laws criminalizing abortion and reducing are prime examples of barriers
unacceptable to the realization of women's rights to health and must be eliminated. "
Unfortunately, both within the EU (Poland, Hungary ...) or
elsewhere, there are still too many countries where women do not have access to legally
abortion, with all the risks that entails (clandestine practices, endangering the
mother, family difficulties in the event of unwanted pregnancy, rape ...). Eco continue to
mobilize on the European and international scene to defend the right to abortion.
Proposal: Improve the framework of the law on euthanasia and better train
Doctors at the end of life
When the pain becomes unbearable, some patients wish to stop it in
requesting euthanasia. In Belgium, since 2002, the law gave a clear patient and
doctor. Euthanasia within the meaning of the law, is the act practiced by a third party, which puts
intentionally taking the life of a person, at the request of the latter. The request of the
person was a central element in the adoption of the text, it must remain so.
For 10 years, whether in neuroscience, accompanying the end of life or the
medicine in general, knowledge and practices have evolved. These developments require
adaptation of the legal framework accordingly.
For Ecolo, the first adaptation to the possibility of drafting a statement early
attests to the personal will to benefit from euthanasia. This statement is
currently valid for 5 years if drawn under 5 years before the start of
unable to express his will. It must be renewed at the end, which requires
fairly heavy bureaucracy for people with an illness. Furthermore,
given the possibility of withdrawal at any time, such a time limit seems
useless. Ecolo therefore proposes to repeal the period of 5 years, while maintaining the course
possibility of revocation at any time.
Then it will be important to discuss calmly the question of enlargement of euthanasia
for people with dementia. Via the right patient, the person with dementia
1
2
Currently, a doctor may assert his "conscience clause" to refuse to perform an abortion.
For more on this, see Chapter "Health".
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter BIOETHICS - 3/6 p can refuse to be treated or take drugs as part of a statement to life
Unlimited, which must not only be saved but that doctors must comply. If they
can let die (of hunger, or other), they can not ask for euthanasia. A
first track consists of unlimited anticipated demand declaration as proposed above.
Reflection should also continue to ensure to persons with dementia law
die with dignity if they so request.
Finally, Article 14 of the law concerning the "conscience clause" says that no doctor is
required to perform euthanasia and no other person is required to participate in a
euthanasia. In case of refusal by the doctor consulted to perform euthanasia, the latter shall
inform the patient or the patient as regards the reasons for his refusal and communicate the dossier
patient medical doctor designated by him or by someone you trust. Ecolo
wants to preserve the conscience clause, while ensuring the patient the opportunity of having a
doctor who agrees to hear his request. Therefore, it appears necessary to introduce, for
the doctor who refuses to perform euthanasia, the obligation to refer the patient to a colleague
or a colleague. At present, in fact, patients with the attending physician refuses access
a request for euthanasia must put themselves in search of another doctor, which is
far from clear for the individuals concerned. Moreover, this conscience clause must
stay single; there can be no question for health institutions to impose this clause
collectively doctors working within it.
We see that many more cases of euthanasia are reported in Flanders than in Federation
Wallonia-Brussels (81% against 19% in Flanders on the French side). This difference is explained
among others by the lack of information to physicians, the lack of specific training in
medical school, a stronger collaboration between the College of Physicians and Universities
Flanders, and a more rigorous application of the law in Flanders. Ecolo proposes setting
instead of better training at the end of life globally for GPs.
Proposal: Oversee the availability of genetic testing
To date, no specific legislation neither prohibits nor regulates the direct sale to individuals
genetic testing, even through the Internet. And while there are approved laboratories in Belgium
to perform these tests with a bioethics coaching and personalized support. he
is therefore necessary to regulate the distribution of such tests and provide information to consumers to
them. In terms of recognition of affiliation - which goes beyond the medical field - only
tests performed by approved laboratories, with accompaniment for the protection of
the child, respect for privacy and consent, should allow capture
courts.
Proposal: Strengthen laws regarding tissue banking, cell and
cord
Ecolo considers that the commodification of life, including humans, is in principle
unacceptable and hopes that the logic behind the establishment of blood banks prevail
Also in the following cases:
define the status of stem cells extracted from umbilical blood and in the status register
Act 1994 to blood and blood derivatives;
specified in the 1986 Act that the removal of the umbilical cord is in compliance
of the Law on the removal of organs;
create a public bank of cord blood with a private bank ban
Commercial (certainly, collection and allocation should remain public).
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter BIOETHICS - p 4/6 Proposal: To better understand the impact of nanotechnology on health
Nanotechnologies represent an opportunity in terms of developments in research and
production of goods but also raise many questions about their possible
effects on health and the environment.
Many consumer products already on the market, use this new technology.
It is therefore desirable that public authorities promote independent research on
potential risks of such use and that a democratic debate can take place on the basis of
research findings.
Proposal: To better understand the impacts of genetic research material on
the health
Technological advances in the field of understanding and mastery of the living
are dizzying. In the long term, DNA modifications are possible. These changes
concern in particular the fight against certain hereditary diseases, but also against other
diseases including those related to aging. These developments raise concerns but also
legitimate hopes in terms of healing. A better study of issues on this subject is necessary
so that an informed democratic debate can take place.
Proposal: Strengthen support for mothers in distress
For Ecolo, it is essential to find a balance between the rights of the mother and father and
Rights of the Child, on the one hand and strengthening the preventive work of information and support
of the mother, on the other
There is a tendency to question the current system wanting to remove all legal ties
between mother and child. For Ecolo, this system works and no number allows to
highlight dramas related to the absence of secrecy (unaccompanied abandonment, infanticide ...). We
one can deny the distress of some women or girls face their pregnancy,
but we believe that it is mainly preventive work Information services
existing that will reduce their number and not a change in the law to allow a
total secrecy.
The search for identity of the adopted person as to its natural filiation is legitimate and will not support Ecolo
no change in the law to prevent this research. In addition, a wish Ecolo
Consolidation of budgetary support to specialized services framing distressed mothers to
enable them to enhance preventive work information.
Proposal: To accompany the grieving parents who had a stillborn child
To mourn her child is a long and painful process. Ecolo intends to modernize and
humanize the procedures in cases of stillbirth because confrontation with bonds
legal and / or administrative can make this process even more difficult. To this end,
accompaniment for the funeral and return home, if parents wish, should
be systematically ensured.
The staff of the various departments concerned (health, marital status) is to be formed
so humanly accompany parents without that nothing can be imposed.
Ecolo also recalls that these amendments do not aim to challenge the law
the abortion.

PUBLIC SERVICE GOVERNANCE
AND PUBLIC SERVICE
Impartial and efficient public services
and accessible to citizens
Inventory and analysis Ecolo
State of play
Democracy is based on representative institutions and participatory processes, it
is accomplished through a political ethics and also based its legitimacy by political
Public implemented to meet public needs.
Thus, should the government provide to the general public, guarantees and services
that ensure life in society in solidarity and equality, and to ensure equitable access to
common resources.
This action may require the direct production, by government, of a good or a service
given. It may also, if necessary, be exercised through an external regulation to
actors. In any event, it is not located in a commercial relationship between supplier and
customer but in a perspective of general interest, support and strengthening of solidarity.
However, in more than one sector, the public service can no longer perform its tasks interest
Generally, it is open to the appetite of the markets under the impetus of competition policy,
particularly European, be privatized as part of a short-term fiscal policy,
or be suffocated by a lack of investment and the particratisation resources.
The European debate on the recognition of services of general interest protected rules
competition and which governments can ensure development is blocked today
by the European Commission. It should continue fighting to protect services
as essential public, and in any case a priority, as health, water or
Education dogmas of free competition and the market.
Participation Ecolo governments of the Federation Wallonia-Brussels, Wallonia and Brussels
led a series of decisions including on two strong pillars: firstly, the depoliticisation
administration, including through the establishment of transparent and impartial procedures
engagement of contract staff where they do not exist (function profile, grille
evaluation, independent jury of ministerial cabinets, etc.) to guarantee access for everyone
and retain the best candidates, or respect for juries rankings for
internal promotions or recruitment of senior officials; secondly, modernization
administration by measures such as the creation of a School of Public Administration in
Federation Wallonia-Brussels and Wallonia, the professionalization of management, evaluation
rigorous senior officials, the deployment of telework, accelerated procedures
recruitment, the opening of the public service to the diversity of society, good management
ecological at every level of administration, etc.
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter SERVICE PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC SERVICE - p 1/24 A federal policy wrong update the Public Service
At the federal level, if Ecolo welcomed the measures aimed to improve
presence of women in management positions in the public service and the law,
inspired by a proposal environmentalists, establishing a status of "alarm bell ringer" to provide
protection to officials who want to denounce unacceptable situations, these advances
are exceptions to the negative policy of the Federal Government with regard to the function
Public. Indeed, the reduction of human resources administration has become an end
almost dogmatic, at the expense of real reforms to strengthen the quality of public service,
adapting the public service and public service to the challenges of the 21st century. Demotivated
agents is growing, which is manifested in particular by the most HIGH1 absenteeism.
The political horizon Ecolo
Ecolo reaffirms its strong commitment to public service, to provide people access
broad, united and equitable services that are integral to life in society and whose
access and use are societal cohesion factors.
Ecolo therefore intends to improve and strengthen the public service, that is to say, adapting the public service
and the public service to changing community needs and demands of the general interest.
This improvement requires reflection and action on the management methods and
governance of public services. It can draw on the methods and tools implemented in
other sectors, but on condition that they are in place consistent with the purpose
of general interest in public service. It is based on a social consensus on the goals of
public sector and the general interest, mobilizing employees around a quality service,
widely accessible, open to its social responsibilities. The protection of vulnerable and
administrative simplification (automation of the recognition of rights as beneficiary
or "Explorers rights" for example) must be in order.
So the ability to serve the general interest which bases the legitimacy of public services and
their workers. They also have an important role to play as an example, that
Whether, for example, as an employer by ensuring equal access to public employment (women,
people with disabilities, people of foreign origin ...), or as manager
Heritage (energy efficiency of buildings, ethical investments, etc.).
The concept of public service must also be extended to all services and goods
essential for which governments must guarantee access to the greatest number.
At the level of the European Union, Ecolo door recognition of services of general interest
protected from competition rules, which the authorities ensure the development and
protection of essential public services such as health or education. Where
private intervention is required and that the matters dealt permit, needs a strong regulator
be in place, guaranteeing the protection of consumers, including the most public
weakened.
Ecolo finally claims that the public service must be an impartial and effective public service

achieve these policy objectives, including the recruitment and objectification
all decisions. It must provide the entire population warranties and services
allow life in society in solidarity and equality, and ensure fair access to
common resources which condition the exercise of individual and collective freedoms.
The main points of the Ecolo project are:
Reinvest and redefine the public service

1

Note also that the latest appointments of top managers of the autonomous public enterprises, carried out under
cover of an objective procedure entrusted to a headhunter, have been botched and again strongly particratiques.
They throw once more discredit on the independence and competence of leaders and administrations
public enterprises, on the principle of neutrality and on the general interest mission of such organizations.

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter SERVICE PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC SERVICE - 2/24 p

Make the public service more accessible to citizens to ensure a public service in
Public Service
Strengthen the impartiality and effectiveness of public authorities
Develop an effective civil service at all levels

Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: reinvest AND REDEFINING THE PUBLIC SERVICE
Ecolo wants to reinvest the public service and to consolidate the legitimacy of its action, the definition
its missions and improving its management, by strengthening its content and its
consolidation not only at European level but also at federal and regional levels.
At these levels, Ecolo insists that public authorities should exercise their right
to impose public service obligations that go beyond the minimum requirements set
at the European level.
Ecolo thus supports the definition of a large public service content to allow
the widest access to all essential goods and services such as including water,
energy, social services and health, professional integration services, housing
public, education, public transport, postal services and waste management, in addition
the services under the authority of the state function, such as justice or public safety.
The entire population should therefore be able to benefit from services which the public authorities
ensure the continuity and quality of services, ensuring their optimum management and their
funding.
It is up to citizens, through the democratically elected government at all levels,
European, national, regional and local, to define what they regard as public services and
Services of general interest.

Proposal: Extend the public and universal service
Ecolo boasts access to essential public services (see above) to each and everyone,
a solidarity distribution costs. Indeed, most of these services are based on
the use of a network and therefore are characterized by high fixed costs. The distribution of
these costs between services and between users is not a technical contingency, but
the result of a political decision. In this area, Ecolo retains the principle of progressive pricing
and solidarity for essential public services, leading to the elimination of royalties
lump in setting a modest price - or even the granting of free - the first
consumption brackets, and funding by the upper slices consumption2.
Ecolo offers:
to extend the rule of Wallonia, Brussels, forbidden to close the gas meters,
electricity and water, without a prior decision of the magistrate to strengthen
protection of the poor;

2

Ecolo obtained the progressive and inclusive pricing of water and electricity in Brussels. Wallonia follows suit
in electricity. A next step in Wallonia and Brussels, would expand the progressive pricing gas.

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter SERVICE PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC SERVICE - 3/24 p

ensure guaranteed by the government, access to all basic service that would
offered by the market3 (banking, for example), as well as its level of
quality ;
maintain, in parallel to the virtual services or online, by a lively wicket
person, to which any citizen, or not familiar with computers,
utile4 can find the information.
Moreover, a series of social impact, economic, environmental or cultural
can function properly without technical and political regulation of operators. In
this framework is favorable Ecolo, under certain conditions, to a control policy,
through an independent authority with the task of supervising the rules put in
up by the authorities, such as minimum services to be provided, the conditions
Operating and certain elements relating to pricing and to the obligation of providing the
universal service.
Finally, in the wake of the recognition of economic and social rights (the right to water
example), Ecolo proposes to include the principle of public service and universal service in the
Constitution.

Proposal: Clarify public service missions
For Ecolo, it is necessary to (re) define precisely the corporate purpose and mission
public service, as well as management and control structures for achieving these
missions. Harmonization must:
clarify the tasks of public interest in the public interest;
identify the holder of public capital (entities with capital) to, inter alia,
enhance transparency concerning the subsidiaries of public capital;
to precisely define the corporate bodies and the respective powers of the management, the
board of directors or executive office, organs of gestion5 and Guardianship;
oversee the delegations and submit regular assessment of body
management ;
making explicit reference to the regulator;
homogenize the legal status of different organizations and insert the
sustainable development - and the obligation of its effective integration - in the corporate purpose
from all public service.
To this end, the objectives for each utility, the conditions with
- Including equality, accessibility, continuity and reducing the ecological footprint - the
resources made available to do this and the performance criteria must also be discontinued for a
fixed period, so as to ensure transparency and democratic control, regardless
the provider is public power.

Strategic thinking will also be initiated to determine the most appropriate channel for the different
types of users and therefore to the different types of related administrative transactions. Indeed, several
"Profiles" of different users feel the need to call a "physical" desk. It will therefore adjust supply
in desk as needed, and situations of administrative relations with users contexts.

Generally, it is the Board of Directors.

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter SERVICE PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC SERVICE - 4/24 p

Proposal: Ask public services such
Ecolo considers that public services must meet specific requirements
social responsibility and supports in this regard:
the systematic insertion in public procurement clauses environmental, social and
ethical, to encourage the use of particular materials, products and the technical
less "heavy" for the ecological footprint and to favor short-circuits, of
to ask the government as actors responsible, socially and
environmentally, through the public consumption;
the refusal to resort to intérim6 or subcontracting in public services, except
demonstrate compliance with the same social conditions and well-being at work as those in
force in public services considered;
the realization by public authorities, including at the level of their building policy,
environmental management objectives, relating in particular to the rational use of
energy, reducing the amount of waste and recycling, and implementation
travel plans for their staff. The requirement for labels
Environmental could be introduced in the management contracts, or in the
goals set in the award of executive officers mandates;
the use of computer software using open standards, in order to ensure
system interoperability, secure archiving of digital content and
ensure the sustainability of electronic access to numériques7 content;
a policy of ethical investments, environmental and socially responsible.
Furthermore, Ecolo considers that public authorities should be a reference in their role
employer, be it in terms of harmonious industrial relations, promoting gender
between men and women, integration of persons with disabilities, openness to
persons of foreign origin or offers of government jobs to workers less
qualified.
Finally, Ecolo calls for the development and continuation of a policy of well-being at work,
an integral part of good management of public services and development-a
culture and welfare policy supported by management in all
departments.

Proposal: Adopt a European framework legislation to protect and
develop public services
Ecolo wants the adoption of a European framework legislation to protect public services
against the threats posed to them liberalization, privatization and contingency
market rules, and to develop them for the benefit of the general interest. The adoption of a framework
European legal is essential for this purpose.
Ecolo and intends to devote public services as the company's founding element
European, social cohesion and its sustainable development, and uphold the interests
General on the rules of competition and commercial profit. For Ecolo, the objective rules
competition is to improve the quality of service provision, consumer choice,
affordable prices and other public projects, including sustainable development.

6
The sixth state reform allows federated entities to use the interim in the public service, like the
currently existing faculty at Federal. Ecolo believes that we must not use this power in the Public Service,
whatever the level of power considered, without warranty as to the social conditions.

For more information about the proposals Ecolo on the subject, see 'Technologies
information and communication ".

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter SERVICE PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC SERVICE - 5/24 p

It is therefore necessary to ensure that the public interest prevails over competition rules in all
scenarios, including for economic services. This is to ensure the right and
ability of local authorities, regional and national finance and manage this type of
services, in the interests of social and territorial cohesion as environmental protection and
cultural diversity.
Through this framework legislation, Ecolo wishes:
reaffirm the principle of subsidiarité8 - which aims to conduct political level
be the most appropriate for citizens while ensuring the articulation between the different
levels of decision making and responsibility - applicable in defining the missions
public service ;
guarantee the financing of public services according to the method chosen by the public authority
concerned ;
preserve the autonomy of the political authority as to ownership;
establish full legal security;
develop public services at EU level where they could
add value.
Furthermore, Ecolo defends the application of these same principles to all sectoral directives
in force or in preparation.

Proposal: Launch a broad participatory process on the issue of
liberalization of services and strengthen public service missions
According to the principle of subsidiarity, the national authorities enjoy real autonomy
define public service obligations in a series of sectoral policies and measure
financial and organizational implications. These sectoral policies concern inter alia
transport, energy, water, social housing, audiovisual, telecommunications and services
postal, health, education, etc.
Ecolo intends to put the issue of the definition of public service obligations in the heart of the debate
Belgian politics through a broad participatory process with all stakeholders and
society organizations, including trade unions, professional associations, NGOs and
users of these public services. The aim is to allow, at the end of this participatory process,
consolidate the public service missions of general interest should be protected from
the rules of competition and liberalization.

PRIORITY 2: ENSURING PUBLIC SERVICE SERVING THE PUBLIC AND MORE
ACCESSIBLE TO CITIZENS
The public authority defines procedures and establishes conditions that can often answer,
in themselves, a certain logic. It appears, however, in a series of situations that if the
system has certainly been designed according to the public interest, it has too often failed to integrate point

8

As said above, it is up to citizens, through the democratically elected government at all levels within
Member States to define what they regard as public services and services of general interest. The principle
subsidiarity - the level of power - is compatible with the development of a common EU approach to
services of general interest, consisting in the development of common criteria (contribution to fundamental rights, satisfaction
the democratic, social and cultural contribution to the quality of life and sustainable development) and
common goals (universal access, social and territorial cohesion, quality, continuity, equality, security, safety, rights
consumers and users, transparency, citizens' democratic participation, sustainable development).

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter SERVICE PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC SERVICE - 6/24 p

of view of the user. The convenience of the administration could then take precedence over the ease of
the user, whether in terms of opening hours or multiplication of documents required.
In addition, the rules to comply with, the requirements or documents to gather themselves
superimposed or added to as and when the new standards, based on
new purposes, without an overall vision has necessarily been cleared and has led
the necessary adjustments to the existing law.
Finally, developments made possible by the development of computer tools do not
yet been implemented, far from it, in all their potentialities.
Ecolo therefore intends to lead public service to the public service and locate the user and the citizen
in the heart of the administrative apparatus.

Proposal: To provide accessible information,
Free and understandable
For Ecolo, the administration must provide an accessible, understandable and
free because its access is a right and not a favor. Its easy accessibility may be through
electronics, in writing or by other means (billboards, written materials ...). She
must be presented in a clear, comprehensive and didactic.
This information implies a duty of active advertising administratifs9 acts, the definition
of case processing standards (mandatory referral to the competent administration,
Direct possibility of contact with the agent processing the file, transmitting an acknowledgment
within ten days with information about the response time ...), as is done already in
several administrations, and the assessment of compliance with these standards on the basis of indicators
concrete results.
Active disclosure requirement needs to ensure access for all to the administration
electronic. More than premiums for the purchase of matériel10, Ecolo advocates to focus on
the friendly and directly accessible cybercafés model, the provision of public spaces
where digital computers and those resources are available. In this context, Ecolo
proposes to ensure the accessibility of these areas by all public (visually impaired,
experiencing reading difficulties or not proficient computer skills ...) 11, including
providing sufficient human and financial resources to these digital public spaces (EPN) for
they perform these functions as a link between the administration and citizens.
Ecolo also meant that when information is disseminated in electronic format, it is the
within the framework of open standards to ensure the widest possible access, regardless
the electronic interface used, and sustainability of access time to this information. Finally,
everyone should be able to request the transmission of this information on a paper.
It should also ensure the effective and practical application of the rule, existing in all
legislation relating to advertising of the administration, that any document must
mention the name and contact information (including phone number, address and
e) of the contact person can provide additional information.

Proposal: Simplify the administrative environment
The vast majority of policy makers and citizens are aware that the procedures
administrative are often too complex and too slow especially globally. One of the objectives
major Ecolo is to allow procedures and operating modes

leading to effective decisions without haste, but in a more timely
today. This applies particularly for priority social objectives,
economic and environmental ethics, that is to say everything about the development
sustainable society and our institutions.
Ecolo proposes to amplify the dynamics of administrative simplification:
coordinating procedures that require it;
by systematically examining readability any draft regulation;
giving priority, whenever possible, the simplification of proceedings or
an existing procedure on the creation of a body or a new process;
limiting the possibilities for an institution to ask for copies of the same document
many times ;
promoting the exchange of data and information between administrations, while
ensuring the protection of such data when they are personal;
by generalizing the "principle of trust" between the user and the administration, that is to say,
the need to avoid the user to produce a series of supporting documents to
when lodging his application or his record (bonuses, etc.), without prejudice
to subsequent review;
by establishing, whenever possible and appropriate, the strict time limits for
procedures implemented. A public service goes into effect procedures
simplified, made within a reasonable time;
dedicating in administrative practice of all public services, the rule
automaticity of rights that allows citizens to enjoy, without application or
prior research, including social rights, they are bénéficiaires12;
ensuring access of the citizens to the various types of aid which they
entitled via the establishment of a "rights Explorer" tool that centralizes all
aids, premiums or benefits, in the Brussels region and federal levels and strengthening the
existing project in the Walloon level. In the same vein, Ecolo offers, for example,
automation for recognition as a beneficiary status for all Omnio
droit13 assigns.
Ecolo also intends to preserve the anonymity of citizens when identification is not required.
Finally, Ecolo considers it appropriate to terminate the administrative cosmetic comprising
introduce new names do not correspond to reality, but a change
reducing user benchmarks.

Proposal: Bringing public services by citizens
frontline counters and hotlines tournantes14
Refer to the user in the shuffle and respond to the pitfall administrations
'ping-pong' which refers responsibilities, Ecolo proposes to install windows first
online, multidisciplinary and common to all jurisdictions in direct or indirect contact
with the public. These frontline counters can then guide citizens
to the more specialized sectoral public services, when necessary. Ecolo offers
also that, in a cross approach, services sector administrations can be

travel within the territory and establish revolving hotlines locally in order to
closer to citizens and local governments.
At the local level, Ecolo proposes to strengthen the mission of information to the citizens on
all matters that may interest the public at the municipal administration:
window of utility water, gas and electricity, postal services or relating to
transport, environmental premiums, schedules of health services, scholarships
studies, etc.
In the same perspective, Ecolo proposes to reorganize, in consultation with representatives of
staff, office opening hours in order to make services accessible to the public
taking account of new social, work and family population. Of
Moreover, Ecolo proposes to provide the necessary resources to monitor calls
telephone and avoid long periods of waiting in line and this in "internalizing" the
Any call center services in Belgium without relocation and therefore in compliance with the
sociales15 terms or conditions.
Finally, Ecolo considers it necessary to inform the practices of "experience experts" from
public services as a whole. These people who have experienced or are experiencing poverty and
exclusion can, by their presence and look, actively improve, and inside,
accessibility of public services for citizens vulnérables16. These practices
should also be extended to all categories of users.

Proposal: Strengthen and expand the jurisdiction of mediation services
The complaints are elements that must be used to improve the service
to the public. Ecolo hopes to expand the role of mediators and independent mediators
offer citizens a path of non-contentious remedies against acts of authorities.
Like the merger between the mediation services of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation and
Wallonia, Ecologist proposes that the same synergy is in place for public services
under federal level and one common federal mediator is competent for
administrations but also autonomous public enterprises, such as by Belgacom
example.
At local level, Ecolo want to encourage municipalities and provinces to conclude an agreement
with the common mediator to Wallonia and the Wallonia-Brussels Federation, so that it can
also exercise his duties towards them and thereby benefit the citizens of its services.
Like what exists in Wallonia and the Wallonia-Brussels, Ecolo offers
Brussels also create an ombudsman to receive and treat, so
independent, complaints of the citizens on the functioning of public services
established at the regional and municipal levels.
Finally, Ecolo defends referral relaxed conditions, the extension of the scope of action
mediators to public service tasks delegated to third parties, together with synergies
to create common mediation services, and expertise to raise questions
referred to the courts.

15

See above in this chapter, the proposal "Ask utilities as examples."
Since 2004, the Belgian authorities have launched the "experts by experience in poverty and social exclusion".
The initiative is the commitment within governments and public institutions "experts" who personally
experienced poverty. 17 Belgian authorities now employ a total of 24 experienced experts, who actively participate
to improve the accessibility of federal public services for vulnerable citizens. For example, in
occupying home and contact functions, experience experts can adapt the institutions to
weakened public. In some jurisdictions (Selor, FPS Home Affairs, FPS Economy, NEO ...), of experience experts
occupy different tasks: observation and advisory functions, launch projects, drafting of studies and reports.

Proposal: Deploy the potential of eGovernment
Ecolo meant that governments further exploit the potential of Directors
électronique17 to significantly reduce the steps to load the population. This requires
by recording the information already provided to the administration, the interconnection between the
authorities, information available to them - except for legitimate reasons for confidentiality - the
generalization of the launch intelligent forms (non-mandatory for use
citizens) it is possible to return electronically including pre-completing these
forms of information already known to the public authorities.
In this context, Ecolo supports the use of free software, particularly to ensure the
transparency and sustainability of public investment in these programs. This would also
more easily to other authorities to reuse the software for their own administration
electronic. The same applies to "third parties" who need to communicate in formats
electronics with a public authority. The computerization of the data (identity document, card
chips in public transport ...) must nevertheless be accompanied by stringent measures
particularly with regard to protection of personal data and uses that are made well
in terms of information for citizens' rights.
Furthermore, the public authorities have a great deal of information that may be
interesting for the general public. This is the case mappings in terms of planning
territory of study or statistics, some of which are already available online. Ecolo
proposes to expand the provision to the public of this information by exploiting the best
Internet opportunities and this in respect of the protection of privacy, copyright
or commercial secret.
In the same vein, and following the example of legislation online sites, Ecolo offers
develop a monitor local authorities, where each region would put online all
provincial and municipal regulations.

Proposal: To evaluate the quality of public services
Ecolo will promote a transparent assessment of the overall quality of benefits
the provision of public goods: water quality or air, provides for energy,
timeliness and quality of transport for example. This assessment is particularly necessary
for situations where an outside operator is in charge of the service.
It must also be clear and accessible to all (billboards in public, website
Internet monitoring, terminals for indicating the air quality ...).
Ecolo also offers the generalization of the Framework for Self-assessment of Public Functions (CAF
or Common Assessment Framework) to allow the quality of the assessment of all
public services.

PRIORITY 3: ENHANCE IMPARTIALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF POWERS
PUBLIC

Proposal: To objectify all public decisions
Too many public officers and citizens consider that some structures or
some citizens are more equal than others. This is their "clients", that is to say citizens
which they are trying to get the votes in exchange for services or promises. However,
17

Also our proposals in this area in the Chapter "Information technology and communication."

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter SERVICE PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC SERVICE - p 10/24

whenever a "piston" passed a folder above the battery, either for a job,
for a promotion or for a subsidy, it is the principle of equality between citizens that is made
evil and, at the same time, the rule of law and democracy. In a context of tightening
public budgets, the cost of clientelism is all the more harshly felt.
Ecolo therefore proposes to objectify public decisions through the application procedures
transparent and organized, including when this is not already the case:
a prior definition of the assessment criteria of the public authority;
complete and accurate information of asylum seekers and potential;
rigorous reasoning behind any decision in relation to these criteria;
adequate publicity post the decisions taken.
This objectification process is particularly applicable to the granting of subsidies or the recruitment of
staff in the public service.
Moreover, some parastatals escape objective recruitment procedures
implemented at the regional and community governments. It should therefore be
objectification strengthen this action at this level as well as at local level where a series of
provinces, communes or intercommunal continue to operate in a passedroits regime.
Similarly, if Ecolo association intends to implement the Charter into binding law for
Wallonia, Wallonia-Brussels Federation and the French Community Commission in their
relationships with associations working to général18 of interest missions, also intends Ecolo
another step, expanding the application of the principles of the Charter to local authorities.
These principles should include driving the government to establish a priori rules
General recognition of associations and financing of their tasks, organize
procedures and criteria made public, or to publish an annual list of grants
Optional granted to associations.
Furthermore, in continuation of its action with regard to the appointment of auditors
companies, the Walloon Government decided to clarify and objectify the terms of
appointment of lawyers in the Region. Ecolo wants to expand this transparent method
impartial at all levels of power.
Also, if Ecolo could garner advances in objectification of the criteria for
municipalities to operate the drawing right to obtain subsidies to finance
infrastructure projects, it remains to expand these rules to policies that can answer the same
logic, such as sports facilities for example.
Finally, to continue to fight against patronage and ensure the objectivity of the decisions taken, it
must, like the Federal Ethics Commission and the Federal déontologie19 Code,
adopt, with other levels of government, a code of conduct in specific, clear and
demanding, applicable to relations between public officers and citoyens20.

Proposal: Strengthen democratic control over the action of
federal autonomous public companies
If wage drift bosses of public companies, especially those of SNCB,
Infrabel and Belgocontrol have been contained, decisions taken by the Federal Government

18

Since (June 2013), the three governments (W, FWB, COCOF) adopted in first reading the cooperation agreement that the
binds to the adoption of the voluntary Charter.
19
The Federal Ethics Commission is competent to issue opinions and general recommendations as well
that confidential opinions at the request of officers (federal parliamentarians, ministers and state secretaries and top
managers).

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter SERVICE PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC SERVICE - p 11/24

allow maintaining high wages bpost and Belgacom, without objective and real basis
regardless of international comparisons. This allows the maintenance of wage pressure
too strong in the latter businesses, in particular bpost. Moreover, during these
recent years, public companies have changed the appropriate Minister on average every
18 months, which undermines continuity in monitoring the implementation, including contract
Management.
At bpost, the need to take account of developments in the postal sector (decrease mail
addressed, full liberalization of the sector) has unfortunately led to a reduction
personal, social regression in the status of many workers and a load
increasing work for all. The IPO bpost allowed to leave the private shareholder
the company reaping significant benefits again to the account of it. More than
ever, the presence of a strong shareholder, namely the state, is needed to ensure
Take the stability and maintenance of targets other than purely stock, including
of public service. The same applies to Belgacom continues to evolve in a sector
highly strategic. The state participation in the autonomous public companies
nonetheless implies the existence of a strong regulator.
Assessment of the EPA management contract
Federal autonomous public companies (EPA), such as the SNCB, Belgacom, bpost,
Belgocontrol or the National Lottery, have a public service mission. The missions and
objectives of an autonomous public company are fixed in a management contract with
public authority - or the responsible minister - for a fixed term. The missions and
Objectives must be within the context of a service (universal) public and prosecution of interest
general. The implementation of this management contract must, in accordance with the 1991 law, be
presented annually by the appropriate minister in Parliament. Unfortunately, this happens
rarely, if ever.
In order to strengthen democratic control over the action of EPA, Ecolo meant that the Ministers of
guardianship apply the 1991 law, present and discuss the implementation of management contracts
with parliamentarians.
Moreover, so far the negotiations on the management contract took place between
CEO21 government and companies without the law provides the possibility for the
Parliament to make its voice heard. Spurred by écologistes22 before writing a
new management contract, the responsible minister must now present the results and evaluation
the previous contract management in Parliament and forward to Parliament the draft
SNCB management contract of Belgacom, bpost, Belgocontrol or Lottery
National. The parliament will be able to conduct a debate on public service missions of these
businesses and involve stakeholders (associations, user committees,
unions, etc.).
Production of a business plan
Ecolo also proposes that each public company responsible for the realization of missions
public service is required to conduct a corporate multi-year plan, controlled by the organs
management. Its implementation should also be regular evaluation in Parliament in
reference to the management contract.

21
CEO is the acronym of the English expression chief executive officer, that is to say, the General Manager or Chief Executive Officer
to designate the person who holds the highest rank in the administration of a company.

See the bill Ecolo-Groen of 16 December 2010 amending the Act of 21 March 1991 reforming certain

EPA objective appointment of leaders
When the outgoing legislature, the federal government offered a sad spectacle politician
when it came to naming the leaders of several public companies. Ecolo proposes that in future
an objective selection is organized for the designation of any executive with a selection
operated by Selor. The procedure should be organized well in advance to avoid that
executives continue to work "acting", which is detrimental to the quality
management of autonomous public companies.
Limiting executive pay
Ecolo supports limiting the income of executives, capping compensation
(fixed salary and bonus) via the definition of an own salary maximum voltage of each company
or agency, in a frame and under a ceiling set by the Government. The government
Federal tried to move in this direction, but quite partial. It must therefore be
continue the work on the one hand to apply the ceiling reference to all the jobs
within public companies and public interest organizations and not part of them,
secondly, and more generally, to ensure limited wage pressure in these
entities.
The same principles should also be applied to all public enterprises,
public interest organizations at other levels of power where this is not yet the case, and
as paralocales23 entities.
Prohibition of double mandates
Ecolo also proposes to prohibit the number of directorships at all levels of power for a
executive order on the one hand, to ensure its full availability in the warrant and
secondly, to avoid possible conflicts of interest.
Public service guarantees
Ecolo including defends Poste, a telecommunications company and of transports24
public service.
Thus, Ecolo intends to maintain majority ownership of the State in Belgacom. So
General, Ecolo refuses a policy to maximize the benefits from further consideration
public interest. Dividend policy matters in relation to invested capital
may be driving patently unreasonable manner, as is the case for example of
bpost to the detriment of the quality of public service and working conditions of staff.
To guarantee the universal service obligations by bpost, Ecolo proposes to take
budgetary provisions to ensure the maintenance of such a large network of points
bpost service, distribution of pensions and home delivery of newspapers and magazines25.
The current management contract provides service to 1300 points minimum, with at least one office
station per municipality. This guarantee proximity must continue, in a cohesion objective
social origin, access to rural and remote areas and the integration of people
reduced mobility.
Finally, with regard to workers' rights, Ecolo refuses any leveling down at
benefit from improved working conditions and this in respect of social dialogue. For
Ecolo, the obligation imposed by law on the liberalization of postal services, to new operators
working with employees and not independent will not prevent competition on the
down wages of workers in the sector. Therefore Ecolo calls for the establishment
a joint committee in the postal sector to upregulate conditions

travail26. The development of precarious status within bpost (auxiliary factors), the
rationalization of distribution (Georoute) and the gradual disappearance of post offices
was the inordinate price paid for privatization by the workers and the
citizens who use and need postal services nearby.

Proposal: Continue the reform of the governance of
public interest organizations and entities dérivées27
The proper functioning of public interest organizations (OIP) faces various difficulties:
lack of independence and availability of the directors, overstaffing, opacity
procedures. Yet these organizations play a necessary role for the public authority.
Therefore, in order to democratize the functioning of these agencies, offers Ecolo, where this is
not already:
de implement a verification process rules of incompatibility and conflict
publics28 of interest for directors;
d'organiser openly and objectified appointing managers
public interest organizations;
d'ouvrir the management bodies of these organizations to a specified number
of directors and independent directors and, where applicable, representatives
and user representatives;
de simplify structures that duplicate or whose missions could be
more optimally performed by another body, and better control of subsidiaries,
which must be subject to the same rules of organization, operation and supervision
that parent companies.
Finally, to limit the use of expensive consultants, whose contribution and expertise are real
sometimes very low, Ecolo proposes that a cell composed of competent and
from different services, assessment, drafting, negotiating and monitoring contracts
management. This cell would provide support and expertise to the Minister for the development and monitoring
Management contracts.

Proposal: Strengthen oversight and governance
inter-municipal and other local entities
The emblematic cases of Dexia / Holding Communal or Tecteo require rehabilitation
Control by the municipalities of the structures they create and finance. Ecolo essential Judge
strengthen control by the municipalities of these public companies become too autonomous to
ensure the public interest and protect the communal assets.
Public service missions
Ecolo intends to protect the public service missions and other inter-municipal companies
public and resize the phenomenon of "nebulae" and intercommunal
Public companies whose public service activities are gradually being in competition with
other business-type activities.

26

It has not emerged three years after full liberalization of the Post.
A derived entity is a public company, an inter, a public interest organization or structure
assimilated.

Limitation rollups
To counter the concentration of power and the risks of conflicts of interest, wants to extend the Ecolo
prevent overlapping subsidiaries intercommunal legislation.
Composition of organs, democratic control, transparency of structures and decisions
and objectification of recruitment
The size of the boards of OIP is now limited to fifteen members. Ecolo
wishes to extend this restriction to local structures management bodies.
Ecolo also believes it is urgent to learn from Dexia record and control
too autonomous structures, such as the Holding Communal, subjecting them to the rules
Transparency, democratic pluralism, control the communal councils and
by tutelle29, etc.
Ecolo also intends to restore the transparency of decision-making within these societies
public and for this:
limiting the delegation of powers to select committees on the pure daily management,
excluding any strategic decision that should remain the prerogative advice
administration, and providing for their periodic review;
expand at any directorship in a public company of the limitation to three
number of remunerated directorships that may hold a same person,
Like what is already planned for intercommunal;
book conventions between a parent company and its subsidiaries to service contracts and
subcontracting without main business transfer.
Finally, paracommunales structures, regardless of their legal form (ASBL, intercommunal,
public companies ....), also present a challenge in terms of objectification of recruitment to all
levels, but even at the top level, the managers and members of management.
The politicization of recruitment is indeed not without consequence in skills,
the motivation of good candidates, equal treatment, public confidence in the
public service patronage. It is therefore a priority to terminate the organization procedures
objective and impartial recruitment.
Framed remuneration
Ecolo wants to ensure transparency and oversee the executive compensation of
intercommunal, like what the Government has already done at the organization level
Walloon of public interest (ceiling, ban pay via management company,
elimination of golden parachutes, etc.).
Democratization of the functioning of intercommunal
Derived entities of Commons, intercommunal must be able to adopt the functioning
democratic. Therefore, during the previous Parliament Ecolo supported the opening
public sessions of the general assemblies and the extension of the consultation by
municipal councilors budgets, accounts and deliberations of the management bodies and
control in inter Wallonie30. Ecolo wants to expand these advances to
inter Brussels.
Finally, the delegation of increasingly frequent missions of various non-profit organizations (para) Communal
decreases the possibility to exercise democratic control. Ecolo therefore proposes, first, to enlarge
the missions of communal31 catcher and Secretary communal32 institutions to control
29

See also our proposals in Chapter "Democracy and Political Ethics."
This possibility is given to municipal councilors, provincial and CPAS municipalities, provinces and CPAS
associates.
31
In Wallonia, the municipal Receiver is now called the CFO.
30

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter SERVICE PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC SERVICE - p 15/24

paracommunales and, secondly, to establish a management contract between (or the CPAS, the
if any) and its derived institutions where this is not already the case.

Proposal: Extend the responsibilities and means of action
Court of Audit
The Court of Auditors is primarily responsible for monitoring the regularity of use
public funds by the Federal State and the federated entities. The sixth state reform allowed
increasing responsibilities and means of action in the context of the consolidation of control
election expenses and party funding. It also widened the
Constitutional jurisdiction of the Court of Auditors in the exercise of new tasks it
entrust legislators federated entities. Despite these extensions, high competence
appears still underutilized.
Ecolo is therefore favorable to the following developments:
extend the general jurisdiction of the Court of Auditors and to the municipal
Provincial and any entity directly or indirectly benefiting from public funds
or in which the public authorities have at least 25% of capital. The Court of
accounts could, in any event, usefully complement the controls and audits carried out in
internally in a number of public companies, formed by the government to
all floors of the house Belgium. In particular, the Court may also participate
actively to the annual assessment of SOE management contracts
autonomous and public interest organizations. This would avoid developing
external audits, currently outsourced to private companies at costs often
disproportionate;
charge the Court of Auditors control the allocation of funds raised by the appeal
generosity of the public at the federal, community or regional;
ensure the intervention of the Court of Auditors in the democratic policy evaluation
public, as well as in the prevention of conflicts of interest.
Meanwhile, of course it should preserve the high quality of work of the Court
clarifying the method of remuneration of certain missions33 and strengthening device
prevention of conflicts of interest in its officers.

Proposal: Strengthen the fight against fraud
Belgium must address a glaring lack of resources to fight against corruption
(transnational), which is relatively importante34.
Ecolo proposes to strengthen the tasks and working methods of the Ethics Office and
administrative35 ethics to return to real control committee (which existed until
1998) and make it competent to the federal state, the federated entities and local authorities, the
where appropriate through the conclusion of a cooperation agreement.

32

Became CEO in Wallonia, it is responsible for a particular role and legal advice
responsible for the implementation of the internal control of local government.
33
Thus, the sixth State Reform stipulated that the new tasks to be entrusted to the Court of Auditors will be to pay
by the requesting entity on the basis of the assent of the Court of Auditors and to preserve its independence.

Ethics Office and administrative ethics, the Control Higher Committee fulfilled missions in Belgium
similar to those of OLAF at European level. This organization was abolished a few years after its investigations
Agusta in the case.

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter SERVICE PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC SERVICE - p 16/24

This Interfederal Ethics Office and administrative ethics have a threefold mission, similar
that of the European Anti Fraud Office (OLAF) 36:
protect the financial interests of the authorities in investigating cases of fraud and
corruption and any other illegal activity;
detect and investigate serious facts linked to the performance of professional activities, clerks
by members and staff of the institutions and bodies of the various authorities
Belgian or over which they exercise a guardianship, facts that could cause procedure
disciplinary or criminal proceedings;
support institutions, in particular the different governments or colleges in
the development and implementation of regulations and anti-fraud policies.
The Ethics Office Interfederal and administrative ethics would be competent for all
institutions and bodies in which the State, the federated states, provinces and municipalities
exert tutelage federal autonomous public enterprises, public interest organizations,
public companies, inter.
Finally, to protect officials, Ecolo proposes to create a status of "ringers alert"
ensuring protection official who in good faith denounce reprehensible acts within
administration, applicable status in all public services, like what
was adopted at the federal government. As regards the latter, Eco
ensure the practical operationalization of the new device and will, if appropriate, of the
simplify. Furthermore, Ecolo will be attentive to the rapid establishment of contact points
central.

Proposal: To evaluate public policies
The evaluation of public policies is not only, or even primarily, a
managerial or budgetary type tool. It also has a democratic issue.
The evaluation of public policies must address the following objectives:
make visible government activity without yield to a technocratic
political control methods;
improve the organization and control of public authorities, without increasing costs
the structures and staff;
promote pluralistic expertise;
increase the participation of stakeholders interested in public policy.
In order to develop a culture of democratic evaluation of public policies,
Ecolo offers:
as a fundamental principle, the need for the legislature to exercise
responsibility for evaluation - upstream and downstream - of public policies;
building, possibly in the coordonnant37, autonomous institutions
can contribute to this dynamic evaluation. Ecolo has placed under
the authority of parliament, charged with regulating and guaranteeing the quality of assessments and

36

http://ec.europa.eu/anti_fraud/index_fr.htm
For example, in the Brussels-Capital Region, Ecolo proposes to create a Brussels Institute of assessment,
prospective and statistics. Effective political action can be conceived more without continuous adjustment of decisions
based on observed effects, based on an independent evaluation. The sudden demographic changes further
Brussels revealed the gaps in statistics and forecasting. That is why we propose to gather
different study centers now scattered in various Brussels institutions (Employment Observatory
Actiris, the Observatory BGHM Housing, Health Observatory and Social Commission of Community
common, the Stib of study service, etc.) within a single, independent institution of government.

37

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter SERVICE PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC SERVICE - p 17/24

to involve the Court of Auditors and mediation services evaluation for expertise
technique of the first or the second field of knowledge;
the involvement of citizens, consumers, workers;
the establishment of a five-year evaluation process of public policies: any
legislation or policy, especially if societal or budget impact
or if significant degree of uncertainty, should be evaluated,
within five years, at the initiative of Parliament or its committees, the
Government mediation bodies or 1% of the electorate;
the determination of indicators at the time of the adoption of legislation or policy
so as to allow the establishment of a monitoring dashboard and evaluation
Periodic legislation and policies to submit to parliaments;
systematization of internal audits by utilities, upstream of the audits
by the Court of comptes38.

PRIORITY 4: DEVELOPING AN EFFECTIVE PUBLIC, TO ALL
LEVELS

Proposal: Enter the public service in a
dynamic continuous improvement
Ecolo considers that public authorities should be a reference in their role
employer, be it in terms of harmonious industrial relations, promoting gender
between men and women, integration of persons with disabilities, openness to
persons of foreign origin or offers of government jobs to workers less
qualified. In this context, Ecolo particularly supports:
the rule of status in the employment contract to organize labor relations, since
that the status of officials gives them protection against arbitrary and puts them safe from
pressures, in order to enable them to ensure the primacy of the general interest,
continuity and impartiality of the public service. The status also organizes procedures
to ensure equal access to employment and the selection of the candidates
fittest, while the contract still allows too often to authorities to act without any
specific procedure; therefore, the statutory recruitment must be privileged, based on a
public call for applications and after passing an examination objectified competition;
adapting the status of the public service to changing societal demands, to
to improve its efficiency in personnel39 management. The status can not be
synonymous with immobility or rigidity, failing to allow its critics
to question its legitimacy;
as regards statutory, relief of the end of own activity mechanisms
public sector to permit the dismissal of Officers misconduct, or
clearly recognized unfit after a regulatory and adversarial proceedings;
to strive for more equality and mobility between different administrations, the
gradual approximation of the Staff of federal, regional governments and
local and parallel to it, the harmonization of local statutes;
a review of the recruitment process and the possibility of recruiting under certain
conditions, people who lack the education or academic qualification required but

the acquisition of knowledge and skills required for the execution of public tasks
(see below);
a well-being at work policy in all its aspects constitutes a priority for
all utilities and integral to the proper management of these. At this
end, it is essential to favor the development of a culture and a welfare policy work supported by management in all departments;
the development of a diverse administration, which is a visible example for the
Other employers, equality of women and men in employment
Disability and employment of nationality or persons of foreign origin;
feminization proxies, coaching and management functions,
the introduction of a minimum gender representation in these functions;
the opening of the public service for persons of foreign origin, expanding
arrangements in Wallonia and the Wallonia-Brussels Federation to other levels of
able.
Proposal: To objectify recruitment
Ecolo proposes to review the statutory recruitment process at all levels. Slowness
Current process disrupts services, demotivate staff and lead managers, too
often, to have use of contract without going through an objective process. The
Governments and the Selor must use in all cases procedures to ensure equal access to
statutory employment and selection of the fittest on the basis of a public call for applications and
after a successful goal contest. For Ecolo, the procedure should not last more than three or
four months.
Furthermore, Ecolo proposes to allow the recruitment, under certain conditions, people
who lack the education or academic qualification required but have a certificate
"Validation of prior learning '(VAE) or certification of competences acquired outside
education. Thus, the public service must recognize the certificates issued outside education
by a public operator for vocational training (IFAPME, FOREM, Actiris) provided that
the achievements of the training process meet the requirements of the corresponding level. The
receipt holders also need access to the selection procedures.
Finally, the recruitment of contract staff can only occur under certain conditions
clearly defined, must also meet the objective conditions. In this respect, progress
obtained by Ecolo in Wallonia and the Wallonia-Brussels Federation an indication
other levels of government.
Proposal: Modernize career opportunities
offered to officers and agents
In too many public institutions, career development is limited to the
promotion, after a decade or more, a small number of officers and agents, the
most often based on the seniority alone or based politicized. Most are
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter SERVICE PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC SERVICE - p 19/24 maintained in an invariable position for a very long time, regardless of the work
completed the training followed and the skills acquired. Such a system leads to the sclerotic
system and demotivate people.
Ecolo supports the organization of a flat career system, allowing them to evolve
dynamically by not changing grade, but progressing in scale
wage scale after specified period of time. Moreover, as a recruitment process
shorter, Ecolo calls for promotion procedures in the hierarchy and to functions
Leaders of a maximum duration of 3 to 4 mois40. It should support greater mobility
within the public service, extending and simplifying the possibilities of change and
transfer.
Such career development in a plane is hinged with training requirements and
devaluation. In the wake of the establishment of the management certificate applicable to public
attorneys in Wallonia and the Wallonia-Brussels, Ecolo has a successful
selection test for management functions and the acquisition of a Patent
direction and success of a selection test for management positions.
Proposal: Simplify the organization and functioning
public administration
Under this term, many synergies have been developed between federal entities:
Public service administrative simplification, common mediation service, school
Common public administration, recruitment sharing reserves, etc. For Ecolo, the
Synergies should be extended to include IT services, internal audit,
Internal Service labor protection, etc.
It should also establish a fair and efficient settlement system
dysfunctions internal to the administration. Indeed, the mediator does not
to act upstream in case of disputes between an agent and his administration. Ecolo therefore calls
strengthening mechanisms receiving, processing and arbitration of complaints of abuse
or internal malfunction to the administration and the establishment of a real department
internal audit that often exists only on paper.
Ecolo also proposes to alleviate the pyramidal structures of government: reduce
number of hierarchical levels and by level, reducing the number of management positions and
ensure better occupancy rate management functions.
In Brussels, the administration of the Joint Community Commission (COCOM) must be
integrated within the department or regional OIP, as is already the case for guardianship over
CPAS. The French Community Commission services (COCOF) must also
work in closer coordination with those of the Region, as Actiris and Bruxelles Formation
preparing it.
Proposal: To implement a real plan mandates to head
Federal Administration
Leaders officials have a certain responsibility in the conduct of policies
public. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the administration is controlled by the officers and
the most competent agents, and that the public authority can govern in a relationship
trust with the senior civil service. This approach was misguided for several
decades by the appointment - almost always life - from senior officials on a basis
typically partisan and sometimes without regard for the skills.
40
And not more than one year as is the case in some jurisdictions.
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter SERVICE PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC SERVICE - p 20/24 Spurred environmentalists, regional and community governments have dusted
and set up a true system of mandates at their head.
Ecolo proposes to implement, at the federal, mandates a regime similar to that established
in the federated entities, in which the government would appoint officials to the general
warrants for a period limited to the législature41, within a pool of candidates and
Candidates holding a public management certificate issued by the Training Institute
Federal Administration after a cycle training and who also passed a competition of a
high standards.
Ecolo also proposes to provide for the application of legislative mandates, subject to
obtaining a certificate of public management, public interest organizations from all
levels of government and other high appointments, for example, Commissioners
Government, where these functions are performed by main activity.
In addition, when appointing agents, Governments should take account of a
balanced distribution between women and men, through the respect of a minimum of a quota
third managers of each sex.
Ecolo finally believes necessary to extend the Brussels Region and the federal state incompatibilities
between senior public servants and the exercise of a local executive mandate and to apply the same
Officers principles to leaders of public interest organizations and businesses
public.
Proposal: Invest in training
Despite the efforts made in this regard, training of officers and public officials
is rarely considered a priority policy for the development of public service and
is also often oriented towards the acquisition of strictly thematic knowledge.
For Ecolo, the training policy must be a strategic priority for the administration,
aimed, firstly, to establish, strengthen or sustain an ethic of public interest, and, secondly,
to ensure the acquisition and maintenance of knowledge and know-how required for the execution of the missions
public service in a dynamic acquisition and strengthening of skills including
theoretical knowledge, practical skills and technical skills necessary for the production of a good
or service in a given context.
Effective policy action must also be based on an efficient administration. In order to
professionalise the public service, Ecolo supports business schools put in place to
design, plan, implement and monitor the training policy, including
continuous training of agents and officers, including in connection with the planned requirements
by developments in flat career.
It is in this perspective qu'Ecolo supported the creation of a common administration from school
Wallonia and the Wallonia-Brussels. It organizes, to candidates and
candidates for executive or a warrant, training and trials giving
in the issuance of patents and direction of public management patents. Certification
experiences and skills acquired will intervene in the same frame, regardless
are the mode and place of acquiring these skills.
In Brussels, the School of existing administration, ERAP must develop strongly and become
the training location of regional staff, and only the local authorities.
At the federal level, the Federal Administration Training Institute should be reformed and
Patents provide direction and management after a training cycle.
41
This system aims to ensure the consistent implementation of government policy and prevent the parties
traditional people can resettle in progress or end of the parliamentary term or attempt through such appointments
policies, constitute relays or impede government action legislatures that follow.
Ecolo 2014 program - book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter SERVICE PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC SERVICE - p 21/24 Ecolo also intends that each agent and agent, statutory and contractual, to be vested
a right equivalent to that of educational leave.
Regarding the assessment of officials, Ecolo defends the establishment procedures
Interactive associating the agent to its evaluation, are based on the job profile and objectives
fixed with management, taking account of the training and the resources available to
the agent.
Proposal: Operationalizing and expand mobility
The mutation of a job to another job within the same administration can make
possible adaptation of resources to public interest needs, much as she can afford
greater fulfillment of the officer or the officer in his work. It is the same, in a
Another measure, the possibility of making transfers between governments or between
levels of power. These changes however are subject, in most cases, procedures
complex and lengthy administrative or simply face a statutory impossibility.
Ecolo intends streamline staff movements within the public service, in the double
Officers and agents of interest and public service, extending and simplifying opportunities
change and transfer, including between levels of power (up locally), with
compliance with a common set of objectification in terms of recruitment and the development of
career, through harmonization and progressive approximation of different statuts42.
Proposal: Limit the numbers of firms and para-administration
Ecolo supports limiting the size of firms ministériels43 personnel necessary for their
operation.
Ecolo proposes to further involve the ministerial pole and the administrative center, including
developing contacts between each firm and the administration, for the early signing
each legislature of a collaboration protocol. Ecolo also proposes the adoption of a
legislation governing the management of ministerial cabinets. Means a firm can not
never be used under the direct or indirect financing of a political party or
part of an election campaign. The collaborators and employees of a firm, if they
can benefit from a political leave and they must also receive advance notice, can not
not be committed within the administration outside the normal rules of recruitment.
For Ecolo, it is important to limit the development of para-government (agencies
governmental, multiple agencies of public interest, etc.) and apply, if necessary,
same recruitment requirements (public call and objectification of skills). Similarly, Ecolo
request not resort to external expertise under strict conditions only when
the necessary internal resources are not available and for tasks that do not fall
structural missions of the administration.
In the same context, it should finally encourage measures to empower
administrations, by transferring some decision making powers previously exercised by the
Government or ministers (power to decide on recruitment and promotions based on a
pre-established budget and in compliance with impartial procedures for recruitment) and
giving them a more strategic role.
42
Staff mobility between the various administrations of the entities of the country is enshrined in the special law,
following the sixth state reform.
43
This should also apply to offices of members of the provincial colleges that are still in the hour
current, given the plethora exercised missions.

INSTITUTIONAL
Institutional modernization
Serving Citizens
Status and political horizon
State of play
Since the federal elections of June 2007 to the Agreement of 11 October 2011, the
Belgium has gone through an unprecedented institutional crisis. This crisis is of course its source
in a variety of causes that precede the election but it reached in June 2010 acuity
unprecedented crystallized by a historic victory of the Flemish nationalists.
Since July 2010, environmentalists have been associated with various forms of consultation and
negotiations set up to break the institutional deadlock and lead to a vote in Parliament
Federal sixth State Reform.
Throughout these steps, Ecolo was facilitated by the constant desire to contribute as much
as possible, in permanent consultation with Groen, seeking solutions for the benefit of
all the inhabitants of our country. The context of social crisis, economic and ecological again
accentuated our desire to find solutions, especially since the absence of such solutions
leading to weaken our country on the international stage and strengthen views
extreme even within communities. This work is accomplished today: dialogue,
respect for others and voluntarism could finally overcome the stalemate and strategy
rotting.
The sixth reform of the State has been passed and put an end to the institutional crisis more
long history of the country. Environmentalists can be proud to have participated in this important
work that led to the thorough modernization of the Belgian federal system. It seems appropriate
to take stock of its essential features, in order to understand better the content and its effects
determinants for the development of future policies of the federal State and the federated entities,
measure the intake manifold and dense environmentalists and understand the proposals
Ecolo formula in institutional matters.
The sixth State Reform
First, a fair financing of the Brussels-Capital Region has been spent, and
balanced solution, which allows to consider a sustainable community pacification, was found
for BHV.
The Senate is reformed and becomes the speaker of the federal entities. Brussels and the Community
German have constitutive autonomy and can in turn, for example,
limit the accumulation of mandates of elected officials. The cooperation procedures between federated entities
see simplified and democratized by introducing into our law of the new form of
joint decrees and orders.
In terms of skills transfer, a series of tools become available for entities
federated. It is up to the regions to seize these new policies to make the
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter INSTITUTIONAL - p 1/14 reforms they consider necessary by using their new autonomy. In any event, it will be
to ensure greater coherence of policies.
In regard to personal matters such as health, politics people
elderly or family allowances, Ecolo has been particularly careful to respect solidarity
interpersonal, which implies, for example, health, access to care and equality
patient choice. The patient will pay the same amount for the same product or the same
delivery, whatever the place in Belgium where this care is lavished. Mechanisms
essential solidarity (funding, RIZIV nomenclature ...) remain common throughout the
Federal social security.
Family allowances, including the transfer remains in our eyes the least meaningful, are
Fortunately the object of exceptional transition period until the end of 2019, to ensure the
continuity of services. Compulsory cooperation agreements shall also ensure
the exchange and centralization of data.
Ecolo wanted to avoid the creation of sub-nationalities in Brussels and ensure recognition
Brussels as a wholly Region, home to a population that has needs, whatever
the language of its inhabitants. Thus the Joint Community Commission (COCOM) is
competent in respect of family allowances, and it exclusively. It is also
whenever appropriate skills involve, for people, bonds or
rights to intervention or allocation1 and of course whenever there are institutions
bicommunautaires2. In addition, to improve the functioning of the Brussels institutions and
application of the principle of subsidiarity, a number of powers were transferred from
common to the Region and the Region to the municipalities.
Other advanced long awaited Brussels becomes competent to the bicultural interest
regional, municipal sports facilities, vocational training as part of
making employment and tourism programs.
While blocking certain excessive demands of public service materials or justice,
Ecolo has been able to garner on fundamentals: the establishment of accountability mechanism
Climate, the protection of federal funding SNCB and consequently, coaching
conditioning cofinancing by the Regions, the levers for reform, replace or delete
provinces, a concrete framework to allow Regions to hold consultations
Popular or the actual installation of an ethics commission agents
Federal public.
Ecolo has also prompted several measures to make more electoral issues
transparent for voters, such as prohibition of double nominations for election
Simultaneous whose terms are mutually incompatible. Such measures should encourage
readability of the campaign and increase voter confidence against
policies. Ecolo has been attentive to other democratic advances, such as improved
terms of voting rights of the Belgians residing abroad.
In terms of funding, Ecolo is pleased to be able to frame the fiscal autonomy,
ensure the ability of each federal entity to finance its policies and distribute so
loads balanced fiscal consolidation between partner entities of the country, while
maintaining social security.
Health, assistance to individuals and family allowances, Wallonia and
Brussels - Sainte Emilie Agreements
In the wake of the VI State Reform, Francophone partners have developed a project
common organization of health skills, helping people and allowances

solidarity.




It is in this context that Ecolo reaffirms its commitment to the federal organization of our institutions
and the federal government itself, in the name of solidarity, cooperation and respect for
differences that drive them.
The sixth reform of the State that require just happened to leave time for the federal government
and different companies in Belgium to integrate their new skills and
the exercise, if necessary, developing the necessary synergies. This integration should
continue over several years and a significant part of mobilizing energies and resources.
In this particular context, new institutional blockages paralyzing the country for 541
days are not an option.
Modernity carrier, originality and universality in this vital debate for the future of
Belgium and its inhabitants, however, intends Ecolo with Groen, continue to modernize
federal system.
This modernization must meet specific objectives and enable:
added value for citizens, by improving the efficiency of public policies,
meeting the needs of citizens and improving the readability of the institutions;
strengthening the ongoing dialogue between the federal state and the federated entities, and
between the federated entities;
respect the right of persons taking particular account of international law.
If the material is technical, it is above carrier and guarantor of fundamental values ​​in the eyes
Ecolo. This modernization can be conceived in accordance with the following principles:

For example, regardless of the steps to take, a Walloon visiting a nursing home does COCOF
will speak at the Walloon OIP (or its mutual if any), which will settle the matter directly with his counterpart
Brussels. Similarly, a Brussels will retain the same administrative contact, he receives benefits
Wallonia (going to a house in Walloon psychiatric care, for example) or Brussels.
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter INSTITUTIONAL - 3/14 p interpersonal solidarity and solidarity between the entities, which require
search for the widest possible financing base and funding in a
logic needs;
accountability in public management;
equal treatment between persons within the same territory;
the interdependence of entities that is expressed by a refusal of competition and a
voluntary and perennial cooperation; the nature of these interdependencies may be variable
following the relevant entities;
subsidiarity, which requires that policies are carried out at the level of power as
suitable for citizens.
Moreover, Eco believes that the institutional debate requires further dialogue between
citizens and institutions. Thus, Ecolo intends to strengthen dialogue, both at federal level
between all entities, could involve citizens more information and participate in
and their involvement.
However, Ecolo is fully aware of the Belgian political landscape in which it operates and multiple
including scenarios that may arise after the elections of 25 May 2014. Therefore, in
Assuming that a large institutional discussions would lead to question our principles and
particular the existence of the country, the federal character of the state or the solidarity mechanisms
interpersonal and interregional, Brussels, Wallonia and the German-speaking entity, forts
destiny that they form a whole community, will continue their development project
common benefit of the entire population, French, and Dutch
German, within the Belgian institutional framework (hypothesis promoted by Ecolo) or
outside.
This last assumption implies that the Wallonia-Brussels Federation then be rethought,
especially to accommodate, if necessary, on the one hand the skills we would be forced
défédéraliser duty and also possibly other skills already défédéralisées.
The main points of the Ecolo project are:
Ensuring solidarity in a modernized federal State federalism
Strengthen the levers of our Regions
Rethinking the Federation Wallonia-Brussels
Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: ENSURE FEDERAL STATE SOLIDARITY IN FEDERALISM
MODERNIZES
Proposal: Strengthen a federal state, efficient and engine
Solidarity
The federal government is expected to retain its powers, particularly in the materials say
sovereign (justice, defense, security), on social security, pensions, law
Labour and Social Dialogue, etc. It should, moreover, be stressed that the mechanisms
essential solidarity (funding, RIZIV nomenclature ...) remain common throughout the
Federal social security.
Ecolo 2014 program - book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter INSTITUTIONAL - 4/14 P. In addition, the federal government was strengthened in his "unifying" role, particularly on the stage
International: it remains the guarantor of the principles of free movement of persons, goods,
services and capital and the regulatory framework of the European Union. As such, its ability to
replace federated entities in case of failure thereof have been expanded, in particular
the commitments made in the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change and European law to reduce gas emissions effect
greenhouse, application of the United Nations Framework Convention or any protocol.
Its regulatory role in financial policies, economic, trade, etc. must
also be amplified, as political calls where consistency in management
Federal, as railways.
Proposal: Organize the election of part of the House from a
federal riding
Currently, federal political representatives have become accustomed to the accountable only
population owned their own language group. This peculiarity of our system
Federal creates a democratic deficit, since the action representatives of a language group
will never be controlled by citizens belonging to another linguistic group. It prevents by
Besides that can form a Belgian organized political opinion and thereby strengthens the
centrifugal movement knows that our political system.
To create an area of ​​federal political debate and empower some of the Elected
Federal before the entire country, from Arlon to Ostend via Brussels, Ecolo offers
organize the election of a significant proportion of elected representatives of the House of Representatives on a base
Federal, within a constituency across Belgium.
The federal riding avoids the Community due to polarization of political elites
which must take into account only the voters in their own language community. Otherwise,
in terms of democratic legitimacy, voters are able to vote for all parties
make up the federal government's gouverne4.
Proposal: Organize a guaranteed minimum representation of the population
German-speaking in the House of Representatives and Parliament
European
Ecolo supports the establishment of a mechanism to ensure, in the House of
representatives, a minimum representation of the German-speaking population while
ensuring the proportionality of the vote. A similar system will be established to Parliament
European, with the same desire to reconcile the minimal representation and warranty
proportionality of the vote.
Proposal: To facilitate positive and proactive cooperation between
partners of the State
Too often cooperation mechanisms are seen as obstacles to autonomy
entities. Thus, many cooperation agreements, however, required by the special law, remain
waiting to be signed. Certainly, it is now possible to adopt the forms simpler and more
Democratic joint legislation but these are available only for
Communities and Regions them without the federal state can take part.
Likewise, consultation mechanisms, such as the association of governments, are
considered marked by excessive formalism.
4
See collective book "Good morning Belgium," Reflections on a reinvigorated federalism Editions Mols, 2012.
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter INSTITUTIONAL - 5/14 p Ecolo proposes to open the form of joint legislation at the federal state and, more generally,
simplify the various consultation tools to effectively promote exchange
information and dialogue between partners.
Proposal: Sustaining simultaneity federal elections and elections
community / regional
Decoupling federal elections and community / regional elections was to
objective of contributing to the emergence of an own political space and the federated entities
allow the appropriation of these new institutions by the population. However, it should be noted that this
target has not been reached. When almost all members of the community governments
regional or participate in federal elections at an eligible site or when a large carousel
ministerial responsibilities is organized at all levels of power after each due date
Election, Democratic clarity suffers and the coexistence of different democratic spaces
becomes illusory. Furthermore, this decoupling results in a permanent campaign, alters
strong ability of governments to integrate the long term in their decisions and fuels
centrifugal logic mentioned elsewhere.
The sixth reform of the State stipulates that the regional and federal elections are anyway
coupled in 2014, the same time as the European elections. In the same vein, the
duration of the federal legislature was increased to 5 years, so that simultaneous elections will
also promoted beyond the 2014 deadline.
Ecolo therefore proposes to perpetuate the simultaneity of federal and community elections /
regional, maintaining the possibility of a federal early dissolution Crisis
and a major renewal for the remaining term of the legislature.
Proposal: To modernize the royal function
Alongside the review of royal endowments system operated during the sixth Reform
the state is still the royal function will evolve like the Belgian institutional system.
Ecolo values ​​and respects the unifying role of head of state in times of crisis and
tension between communities or when it acts to strongly support democracy, fight
against extremism and social inequalities or to accompany training
federal government.
Ecolo wants to modernize the procedure for sanctions laws, and proposes that the sanction of laws or
exerted by the Federal Government, as the procedure applied at the entity level
Federated, with language coverage required. The appointment and dismissal of
Ministers and Secretaries of State within the jurisdiction of the federal legislative authority, also
on the same model as the federated entities. Furthermore, given the establishment of the tribunal
application of penalties in 2007, it seems appropriate to remove the royal prerogative to hand
or reduce the sentences imposed by the courts. Along similar lines modernization,
Ecolo proposed deleting obsolete attributes assigned to the King, such as conferring titles
nobility.
Proposal: Improve the transparency of the appointment of judges to the Court
Constitutional
The Constitutional Court plays a fundamental role in the Belgian federal system and appeasement or
unlike the upsurge in communal conflict (see the famous BHV stop). Today,
twelve judges of the Court are appointed for life by the King from a dual list submitted alternately
by the House of Representatives and the Senate. This list is passed by a majority of two thirds
Ecolo 2014 program - book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter INSTITUTIONAL - p at least 6/14 of the votes of the members present. However, no exchange or debate is organized
between the candidate - judge and the meeting presenting it.
With a view to assess their competence and quality to this function must be
above the fray and partisaneries, it is desirable that candidates for
advisers to the Constitutional Court presenting their candidatures before the assemblies,
to allow an exchange of views on how they see their function and
operation of Belgian federalism.
Moreover, Ecolo defends a balanced presence of women and men within the Court
constitutional. Currently, of the 12 Court magistrate positions, only one is occupied by
a woman. Ecolo therefore wishes to introduce the requirement of a minimum quota of one third of the judges
different sex among the judges of the Constitutional Court.
PRIORITY 2: STRENGTHENING THE LEVER ACTION OUR REGIONS
Proposal: Increased skills and best comic
Over the successive reforms of our state, the regions have gradually asserted in
the organization of our institutions, like the reference federated entities. This rule has little
just imposed on the basis of several tangible realities: an area in which the Regions
exercise powers that they can implement according to their specificities, the election
direct their representatives the ability to tax and thus have autonomy over
large of policy, responsible for organizing local authorities and thus control
the political and administrative organization within them.
While remaining mindful of the political space and solidarity that bring Wallonia and Brussels,
Ecolo was actor of this development.
We intend to strengthen this reality today and levers of our regions in their
confident the full and new management skills from the Flemish Community
and the Federation Wallonia-Brussels. Specifically, Ecolo proposed that the Constitution and laws
Special symmetrically be amended to grant the three Regions full competence
on matters of vocational training, social welfare, the disabled, health
or the reception and integration of immigrants; or matters that the French side,
are currently carried out by the French Community Commission and Wallonia.
Similarly, to ensure greater coherence through the exercise of the same
policy on the same territory, Ecolo proposes that the three regions are being symmetrically
assign a series of currently assigned to the Communities skills: hosting
children, sports, youth and youth assistance.
In Brussels, the transfer of powers to the Region is accompanied by the maintenance of mechanisms
protection of Dutch minority of Brussels.
The DG, meanwhile, will retain all its skills in
above materials if awarded to the three Regions.
Ecolo also proposes to entrust the Brussels Region currently some skills
the hands of the federal state: the bilingual and bicultural subjects of regional interest.
Proposal: To simplify and increase the coherence and effectiveness of institutions
Brussels
The institutional changes in our country has led to a tangle of institutions, bodies and
authorities. If this development, the result of difficult compromises, was able to maintain peaceful relations
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter INSTITUTIONAL - 7/14 p between the different communities and regions of our country, it also induces effects
perverse.
Firstly, it undoubtedly led to a complexity of institutions that arouses
incomprehension and the remoteness of the citizen. In addition, it leads to a decision-making process,
in the implementation of certain policies can be particularly long and tedious.
A particularly illustrative example of these pitfalls is found in skills
held within the Brussels institutions, shared between the Region, the commission
Joint Community and language community commissions.
Ecolo therefore calls for a drastic simplification of these institutions to the benefit of better
visibility for the citizen and greater efficiency in decision making.
This simplification involves removing three community committees (COCOM,
COCOF and VGC) and their integration within the Brussels region. Skills transfer
the COCOM to the Brussels Region is accompanied by the maintenance of protection mechanisms
the Dutch-speaking minority in Brussels.
Proposal: Undertake reforms in Regions
The multiplicity of actors and too many institutions is well established and can be
the source of many dispersion and dilution of power, and sterile competition
loss of energy and resources.
Vector sub-localism and baronies, it is superfluous institutional fabric
particularly costly for the community and naturally impairs the emergence of a vision
a regional authority.
Ecolo thus considers necessary to undertake the necessary institutional reforms within
each Region.
At the level of Wallonia, it is a priority to remove the provinces and create a
Walloon constituency.
Thus, within the framework of the VI State Reform and spurred Ecolo, the Regions
obtained the necessary levers to pursue constitutional reform level
intermediate, started the Walloon regional level under the current legislature and has particular
led to recalibrate certain provincial jurisdiction, to reduce the number of deputies and
provincial councilors about a third of all provinces, etc. Thus, the Constitution
no longer prevents the provinces to be removed or altered, their number can
they can be modified or be replaced by supramunicipal communities. With
full autonomy now available to Regions in respect of the provinces, Ecolo request
breaking down existing provinces in Wallonia by operating the transfer of skills
to the most appropriate levels of authority (Region, communities, towns or Communities
territory). This reorganization will be made in respect of employment, in keeping
public service tasks performed and improving the services provided to citizens and
citizens.5.
Ecolo also intends to promote the emergence of a regional-wide vision of Wallonia by
the creation of an electoral district covering the whole region and based on
which is elected for a significant share of the Walloon Parliament, respecting the representation
proportional.
At the Brussels-Capital Region, intra-Brussels reforms initiated in the
framework of the VI State Reform, will continue in regionalizing the management and maintenance
5
Like the transfer of powers from the federal state to federal entities, among federated entities (Saint-Quentin)
or the transfer of powers from the former Province of Brabant to the Brussels institutions, it is obvious that
the transfer of staff will focus on the transfer of skills.
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter INSTITUTIONAL - p 8/14 of large green spaces and large sports facilities.
Generally, higher efficiency is sought in policy articulation
of the Brussels Region and municipalities, including the implementation of force-lines
following:
respect the subsidiarity principle which is to conduct policy at the level where they
are most effective to address the problems of Brussels. The regionalization
specified in the preceding paragraph shall implement this principle;
contractualization of relations between the Region and the municipalities, regional subsidies
being conditioned to compliance by the common regional sectoral policies;
deconcentration of regional services;
seeking economies of scale while maintaining essential public services
proximity.
Proposal: To entrust the Brussels Region a jurisdiction
bilingual education in Brussels and in project and bicultural institutions of regional interest
The rules of distribution of cultural skills are not suited to the character
bilingual Brussels Region in that they do not allow the Region to develop
bilingual initiatives. These rules are designed in a unilingual community perspective, are well
out of step with both the institutional and sociological reality of the capital. This partitioning
community, institutional sense, makes any project of collaboration between actors
Brussels cultural communities of the two especially difficult, while they are neighbors,
attract and pursue common public sometimes similar artistic approaches.
True, a supplementary scheme was planned for bilingual institutions or initiatives
cultural through the residual jurisdiction of the federal state. It must however be noted that
simply manage federal scientific institutions without investing any other field of its
cultural skills in the Brussels territory.
Given this situation, Ecolo proposes to transfer cultural competence in the Brussels Region
bicommunal of regional interest. This notion registered for the first time in the texts of
VI State Reform should now be greatly expanded to include particular
competence in bilingual local TV or the creation of bilingual libraries
our capital.
Moreover, given the social, cultural and economic importance of bilingualism
Brussels and inertia guilty of the federal state in the matter, it seems essential to allow
the creation of a bilingual education in Brussels and therefore to entrust this power to the
Brussels Region. This specific exercise jurisdiction is without prejudice to the competence of
In education communities.
Proposal: To permit the filing of bilingual lists for regional elections
Brussels
Already in the communal elections of 2006, Ecolo included Groen candidates on its lists for
the 19 municipalities of the Brussels Region. In 2012, Ecolo and Groen made a step further
creating truly common lists. Indeed, unlike the regional level,
constitution of such lists is possible at municipal level. Ecolo and Groen therefore course
made this choice at the municipal level because they defend the same social project, because the
Dialogue and consultation are at the heart of our political practices, but, first and foremost,
Ecolo 2014 program - book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter INSTITUTIONAL - p 9/14 because Brussels is a bilingual region to bilingualism and that it must meet
in Brussels structures.
For Ecolo, it should also provide the opportunity for candidates for regional elections
train bilingual lists in respect of guaranteed representation of both groups
language. The objective of the proposal is to transcend community divisions that
divide and compartmentalize the country and translate it concretely as possible the bilingual character of
the Brussels Region.
Proposal: To ratify the Framework Convention for the Protection of Minorities
On the sidelines of the Francophone gains made in the context of the VI State Reform in terms
electoral and judicial rights of Francophones special status communes, Ecolo supports
the ratification of the Framework Convention for the protection of minorities by the Federal State and the
federated entities, in line with its signature dated July 31, 2001, on behalf of
Kingdom of Belgium and the recommendations of the Parliamentary Assembly of
Council of Europe. It is well to recognize and protect all minorities identified
such as the federal, community and regional level.
For Ecolo, we must also do away with the "pesterijen" and other red tape
unnecessarily and unfairly complicate the life and work of citizens, he
whether access to housing or property, job search or enrollment in school.
Besides the ratification of the Framework Convention and the recognition of the Francophone minority of the
Brussels periphery, apply the linguistic facilities, with no narrowing in
the respect of citizens and in the interests of administrative simplification, profitable for both
People for the authorities themselves, and that, whether Flemish or French.
Proposal: Giving Life Metropolitan Community
Brussels is a social and cultural economic center of primary importance, both in scale
Belgian and European. As stated in the interinstitutional agreement, its socio-economic influence
goes far beyond the territory of the 19 municipalities of the Brussels Capital Region. It is nearly
35 towns at least, located in Flanders and Wallonia, which are a real
Metropolitan Community, the natural hinterland of the capital. Again, rather than mistrust or
competition Ecolo calls for the establishment of close and sincere cooperation across
this area in such essential matters as employment, the economy, mobility, development
territory or the environment, including.
The sixth State Reform devoted for the first time the creation of the Community
Metropolitan Brussels made up of representatives of the three regions, municipalities
Brussels, the two provinces of Brabant and the federal state. Despite the need to view it
develop mutually beneficial collaboration on matters of cross-regional importance
such as mobility, road safety and road works from, to and around Brussels, the
concrete modalities of this dialogue are struggling to emerge. Thus, a cooperation agreement must
still be concluded between the three regions to determine the terms and subject to the consultation.
However, as demonstrated by the unilateral decision of the Flemish authorities to extend the route of the North
Ring, the consultation bodies are more essential than ever and their implementation
urgent. Such bodies may in no case be limited to economic dimensions
related to the Communauté métropolitaine. They should be designed to serve to provide
concrete solutions on key issues, identified cooperation.
Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter INSTITUTIONAL - p 10/14 PRIORITY 3: REFOUNDING WALLONIA-BRUSSELS FEDERATION
Institutional interdependence Area and voluntary solidarity and sustainable between
Francophone Wallonia and Brussels, Ecolo offers to refound the WallonieBruxelles Federation. In Belgium in constant institutional evolution, Ecolo believes that the role and
competences of the Federation Wallonia-Brussels should be revisited to reflect the best
realities of a Belgium composed of Regions with enhanced skills while continuing
to embody, in practice, this role of bridge between Francophones, particularly through its
Parliament and Government. This constitutional role is particularly evident in
Essential Skills of education and culture.
In this sense, it seems essential to deploy the skills of the Federation around the two
pillars of any case in education and culture.
By education, we mean of course all types of education (basic,
secondary, special, superior, social promotion), but also basic research.
By culture we aim the broader culture (arts, literature, plastic arts ... but
as audiovisual and continuing education).
This role as a bridge institutional union must also be strengthened through structural measures
operation. Ecolo therefore calls for example that the Government of the Federation
Wallonia-Brussels is composed of regional ministers in Wallonia and Brussels and that the Committee
Select Ministerial (or Kern) is made up of ministers from the Walloon and Brussels Regions.
The same logic hyphen and space of solidarity and interdependence should prevail between
the Brussels Region and Flanders.
PRIORITY 4: THE GERMAN-SPEAKING COMMUNITY

Proposal: Recognize the German Community as a separate entity
entire Belgian federal system
Like the Brussels Region, the current German-speaking Community has gradually
emerged as a federated entity to the equal of other entities comprising the Belgian State. Alongside
other entities of the country, the German Community is a separate entity, which
exercise of Community powers and regional powers. Ecolo wants it
be recognized as a full partner within the Belgian federal system we want
continue to modernize; we shall be guided by the principles of interpersonal solidarity and
solidarity between the entities, accountability in public management, equal treatment
individuals and voluntary and sustainable cooperation.

Ecolo program 2014 - Book Democracy, Governance and Equal - Chapter INSTITUTIONAL - p 11/14

Proposal: Boost the scope of the subsidiarity principle by the transfer to the
German Community exercise of provincial jurisdiction and
as certain management skills & Planning
Planning and logement6
Wallonia has transferred to the German Community exercise of some of its
skills monuments and sites7, employment and fouilles8 and exercising
some of his skills subordonnés9 powers. These transfers of exercising
skills are part of a reconciliation logic of subjects and policies at
closest to the citizens, so far as appears relevant and that it does not hurt to put the
policy coherence relevant institutions, this does not weaken solidarity and
it does not generate competition issues.
For Ecolo, the modernization of our federal system requires a dynamic application of
principle of subsidiarity, which aims to carry out policies at the most appropriate level of power to
citizens, while ensuring the articulation between the different levels of decision and
responsibility. Consequently, Ecolo sharing the goal of consistency of powers exercised by the
German-speaking Community.
With a view to taking better account of the specific, particularly in terms
cultural and linguistic, Ecolo believes that the German Community could also
awarded provincial jurisdiction under the reform communities
territory or, if necessary, in anticipation of this reform. The territory of the speaking region
Germany could indeed form a community of territory, whose organs could, for
example, emanate from those of the germanophone10 Community.
Finally, Ecolo believes that Wallonia could, according to the principles of subsidiarity and
above decentralization, entrusting the German Community exercise certain
regional expertise in the field of spatial planning & development and for
Housing, for the aspects of policies which lend it.

Proposal: Strengthen the synergies between Wallonia and the Community
German
Solidarity and interdependence between German speaking and Francophone Wallonia results
in their ability to implement, in a dialogue of equals, specific process
intended to lead to better policies, considered in skills for the benefit of
populations concerned.
It comes to feeding synergies not only between the two entities, in the areas
the year was transferred to the German-speaking Community but also in other subjects
which, like those included in the cooperation agreement signed November 26, 2008,

Note: The various transfers of powers envisaged between the Walloon Region and the Community
German will have to be monitored depending on the progress of discussions and negotiations between the
Walloon Government and the Government of the German Community by the end of the 2009-2014 parliamentary term. This
includes the corollary question of the possible transfer of the legislation on local authorities that relate to these
skills.

does not give a restrictive framework for collaboration and allows expansion to other materials
through the conclusion of sectoral agreements.
The new form of cooperation that constitute the joint decrees and agreements

Justice and Security
JUSTICE AND PRISONS
Accessible justice, the guarantor of freedoms and
Rights
Status and political horizon
State of play
Historically, the company had to deal with crime and violence on people. But
the weakening of social ties and the increasing dehumanization of relationships between individuals
Always make it more difficult dialogue, exchange, peaceful and constructive settlement of
conflicts. The increase in situations of poverty and precariousness as well as political
Exclusion (unemployed, asylum seekers, etc.) weaken even more societal balance
and prevention policies. Being assaulted, robbed or simply live in a sense
insecurity or fear can cause people to distrust and withdrawal. Justice,
seen as the only remedy possible, faced enormous expectations to him.
The lack of preventive measures and deterrence leave the police and
parquet a very great responsibility in terms of defense of the right to security. It is still necessary
Justice that has the means to hear the litigants and to restore the authority of the rule. Gold,
the lack of resources and delay in reforms of its organization, yet too LEAD
often the feeling of denial of justice in the eyes of a number of citizens.
Some feel a sense of impunity, others a sense of abandonment and insecurity
unacceptable. In civil matters, certain situations sometimes lead to conflicts that fester
could be solved quickly and easily. In criminal cases, they can lead to
desires for revenge or a desire to do justice himself. These elements, added
costs of procedures discourage many litigants who do not have the means
support a long and uncertain procedure. Alternative methods of conflict resolution,
such as mediation, could constitute a real alternative but too often
unsung little bit encouraged and funded.
Furthermore, since the 90s, rather than strengthen justice by making it more
operational, there is a shift from the judiciary to other levels of power,
contempt of legal certainty which only the judiciary is the guarantor. Criminal Justice
relocates by giving the common a judicial function, allowing them to impose
municipal administrative sanctions against infringements of mixtes1. They thus participate in
unraveling process of Justice.

1
Hybrid offenses are offenses of the Penal Code (under the judiciary) for which the legislator
authorizes the town to apply administrative sanctions (different in each municipality). For Ecolo, the concept
hybrid offenses, by its nature, is problematic under the principle of separation of powers (an organ
Executive who is awarded legal skills) and the lack, at the municipal administration,
legal guarantees provided by the judiciary, at the municipal administration. Ecolo believes that the reinforcement
SAC of the system itself creates a "judiciary light" parallel. Find our position on the fight against
incivility and municipal administrative sanctions later in the chapter (see below).

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter JUSTICE AND PRISONS - p 1/25

In addition, spécialisées2 administrative courts were created by way of Regions
spontaneous reaction to the jurisprudence of the State Council, no overall level of justice
administrative. Resulting lack of clarity for the citizen and influence
the organization of the State Council with the disappearance of some rooms, following the creation of
specialized courts.
Recent legislatures have allowed some progress but all the promised reforms
far from complete. Some of them are still awaiting funding announced or put into
concrete work. Others require additional reforms to be totally
applicable. Urgent reforms are still not completed, such as reducing the backlog
judiciary, the computerization project of Justice and the setting of an objective and precise framework
members of the judiciary. In addition, continuity of service in the courts is made
distressed by the systematic postponement of new appointments of judges, lack of
budgetary means.
Instead of reinforcing the actors in their missions and provide the minimum funding cellesci, the federal government imposed, once again, a dose of austerity in all sectors
of Justice, undermining the necessary relationship of trust with the representative bodies,
angering field actors and critics of human rights defenders.

The political horizon Ecolo
Ecolo Justice intends to make its role as the third federal power, the regulator of social life,
guarantor of freedoms and rights of each and everyone. Justice is at the heart of expectations
the citizens. Some of these expectations can be met through reforms
Important judicial organization, others by a change in attitudes and work
awareness of judicial actors and women and politicians.
Improving Access to Justice: Justice is often not easily accessible for a large
majority of the population. For Ecolo or socioeconomic origin nor language, nor the origin
sociocultural may restrict access to justice. There can therefore be a justice to two
speed, the second would be engaged by individuals having the means, through
criminal transactions.
Better access to justice should be seen with vigorous policy
Prevention trials, reduction of procedures and promotion of alternative methods
conflict resolution.
Reduce the judicial backlog: via an ambitious transverse plane to allow judges
render justice within a reasonable time, as it passes through the computerization of Justice that
by the review and coordination of the Criminal Code of the Judicial Code and Instruction code
criminal, to make the duration of faster procedures, as a revaluation and
strengthening of material and human resources of Justice.
Ensure an active role for judges in accordance with the judge's independence and character
adversarial procedure, Ecolo advocates a more active role of the judge as a master
conduct of the proceedings of a procès3. Ecolo expect our judges to leave their more
reserve, they are open to listening, complexity, invest, give the floor, direct the
debates.
Ensure independent Justice: Justice must be rendered by the judges, in compliance
judicial guarantees and defense rights, with independence and impartiality. For

It is there, the Flemish administrative court for administrative litigation and environmental and project
Walloon administrative jurisdiction: the Council of the Walloon administrative litigation.
3
Over time, the judge has become "active" and "effective" in carrying out procedures to meet
including international constraints such as respect of Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights
Rights, guaranteeing the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time. But it rarely control management
procedures.

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter JUSTICE AND PRISONS - p 2/25

Ecolo, the jurisdictional function of judges can not be transferred to municipalities or other
executive.
Ensuring predictable Justice: the consistency, transparency and advertising texts
laws, constructed from a long-term political vision and based on regular assessments
upstream and downstream. Avoid any legislative frenzy, under the influence of emotion and based on
exceptional cases. No legislation may restrict the independence of judicial actors.
Ensure a more humane justice: so that individuals and victims have a greater right
to speak in trials, more active participation in a meaningful debate, a role
effective in finding the solution that ultimately will be imposed. More human justice,
right to be listened to and heard, human hospitality, respect for the dignity of each individual, are
based claims. To meet these requirements, Justice and judges should
closer to the realities of terrain and litigants.
Allow the class action: so that justice can be adapted to the realities of modern society. The
acts, whether from government or the private sector, affecting a fringe more
large population. Therefore, non-compliance with a legal rule or a violation of a standard
caution can have a serious impact on society and quickly cause damage
mass. The class action allows victims of damage common to band together to act
Justice together.
Diversify alternatives to imprisonment: the imprisonment is only one answer
to the problems of delinquency. However, it is still often seen as the only penalty
valid, with known consequences in terms of overcrowding and conditions
inhuman and degrading.
Change direction and criminal philosophy focusing on:
prevention, an important key is education in the broadest sense, without
forget that of redress;
credible alternatives to preventive detention because this "punishment before judgment"
collides presumption of innocence; it must only be maintained
when it is essential to the company's security;
the meaning of the sentence, both for victims and society and to the convicted person.
Far from favoring impunity, the diversification of penalties instead allows them to adapt not
only to the gravity of the offense committed but also to the kinds of facts.
Redefining prison policy: the prison sentence, when it can not be avoided, must be
executed in conditions that respect human rights, be accompanied coaching
psychosocial and be harnessed to prepare the output and limit recidivism. The issue of
prison health is also a major challenge and requires rethinking the whole system,
including finding a better distribution of powers between the SPF Justice and SPF
Health.
The internees must for their part be urgently prisons outputs to be
supported in appropriate care settings.
Coordinate the judiciary and police services: the fight against impunity and
insecurity requires a good relationship between the judiciary and police4 of services:
Justice controls the police and the police working for Justice. Such consideration would
work on a classification rate currently no further questioning (76% of complaints)
demotivating for frontline actors, often incomprehensible to the victims and
creating a sense of impunity among the offenders.

The lines of force of Ecolo for justice are:

The administration of criminal justice should be seen as a system in which actors from different institutions
interact: citizens, police, prosecution (if statement), trial courts and execution of the sentence.

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter JUSTICE AND PRISONS - p 3/25

Homophobia

Develop a policy for the execution of consistent and individualized sentences
Adapting family law to changes in society

Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: MAKE ACCESSIBLE JUSTICE
Proposal: Ensuring access to justice for all and all litigants
(juridical help)
For Ecolo, it is urgent to make justice more accessible to citizens. This requires
first and foremost by improving litigants support systems (fundamental right
guaranteed by Article 23 of the Constitution), including for those who wish to do first
appeal to all alternative forms of dispute resolution such as mediation or arbitration.
Indeed, these tools are fundamental because they avoid lengthy procedures and
costly and contribute to better living in society.
The first line of support services should also be maintained and supported because, as often
free, they play an important role in the understanding of his rights by the litigant
and avoid many conflicts or resolve them before they escalate.
In terms of second-line legal aid (pro deo counsel) is a thorough reform
necessary. Without prejudice to the right of the weakest to receive this assistance, the nomenclature
the actions of the lawyers appointed under legal aid must be reviewed and adapted
realities on the ground, in consultation with lawyers. Meanwhile, the "point" value must
be revised and set at a decent level for lawyers who agree to engage in
the system of legal aid. There is also place to significantly reduce the time for payment of
fees of the lawyers currently have almost two years to wait to be paid.
This reform must also be accompanied by a refinancing of legal aid in its
together and an exemption from VAT for these benefits.
Ecolo proposes pooling legal defense costs which, like health insurance
disability, would be universal and would be based on solidarity. The contribution would be proportional
income.
Complementary to this solidarity formula, ways of promoting active policy
Alternative dispute resolution should be continued and developed by the implementation of a
information mechanism formalized and compulsory litigants as to the existence of alternatives
credible judicial proceedings. This policy of promoting to litigants must

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter JUSTICE AND PRISONS - p 4/25

obviously be accompanied by a policy to facilitate access to practical training for
the actors who wish to invest in its alternative methods of conflict resolution. There
awareness of these conflict resolution mechanisms should also begin training
basic, especially for lawyers.

Proposal: Improve the integration of victims
before, during and after trial
If the 2006 reform was an important step in the granting of rights to victims, we see in
practice that they still feel too often ignored or set aside, as in the phase
the above judgment, that during the trial or during the execution of the penalty phase.
Faced with the facts of serious violence or as bad as the loss of a child or a loved one,
judicial or police stakeholders are unfortunately not trained to deal
account, next to their work, the psychological aspects of the situation and the need for information
and explanation of the victims and their relatives. Pending the arrival of support services
victims, they feel and are therefore left to themselves and pending information.
Particular attention should also be paid to victims of road accidents, too
frequent and unfortunately often trivialized.
Provide means to support services to victims at every stage
To avoid further aggravate the trauma inevitably entailed such a situation, it is
Ecolo essential to that among the first people to arrive at the scene of a drama, there
is always at least one person who is charged (and formed for this purpose) to take charge
victims and / or their relatives and answer their questions. This person would be part of
services for victims or the police if the victim services are not
immediately available.
It is equally essential that the victim services and hospitality services
victims have the means to follow up people who want in the weeks,
or even months, after the drama in which they faced. For this purpose, it is also
strengthen cooperation between the police, the judiciary and the services, so that they
can be a real relay information between the victims and their families and Justice under
wide.
Consider the place of the victims and their relatives in the proceedings
Ecolo proposes to start reflecting on the practical conduct of hearings and the place
Physical victims and their relatives during the proceedings. This would, for example,
allow victims to sit next to their lawyers during a trial sitting, avoid very
practically, the victim or relatives should not attend the same toilet or rooms
waiting that the relatives of the author interruptions during a trial, prevent the ministry
public and the judge enters the court room set or the same door ... That kind
Development does not necessarily require additional resources and participates in
humanization of Justice.
Ecolo also believes that Article 162 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which deals with the management
charge of procedural costs, including the cost of the criminal investigation, should be reviewed. Indeed,
as currently drafted, it requires the criminal judge to put all of these charges borne
the civil party that put in motion the investigation when it leads to no
criminal conviction, especially when the author is unknown.
However, the civil action is the only way for a victim to have full access to
his file and to be able, for example, request additional investigative duties. He ... not
must therefore not that it causes dramatic consequences for the victim who dares cross
not.

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter JUSTICE AND PRISONS - p 5/25

That is why we want to give a discretion to the judge, who can then decide
the circumstances of the case if it makes or not charge court fees of the game
civil.
Ecolo also proposes to reinforce the involvement of victims in the proceedings or release
release of a condamné5. It aims to broaden the categories of victims can
give notice in the liberation procedure and allow victims to be warned earlier
the implementation of certain procedures.
Implement a class action procedure
Finally, Ecolo proposes that Belgium complete its legal arsenal by a true process

class action. This procedure, unlike that proposed by the Government, would not
limited to injured consumers but would allow victims of a common shame to
together to work together in Justice. This damage can also be caused by
great railway disaster, as a drug or an illegal business practice.
Seeking legal redress, victims of mass damages will benefit the
benefits the group: compression costs, collection of evidence, findings
facts, Head of Research, etc.

Proposal: Extend associations the right to take legal action

Associations play a vital role in building a representative democracy,
the defense of the environment, of the most vulnerable and in consideration of
social issues, because they can defend an interest shared by many
people.
But at present, the right to sue Justice is recognized that some associations
specific areas (human rights, fight against racism and xenophobia, practices
trade, industrial action). Each law sets itself the criteria which the associations
must meet to access justice. This lack of global regulation causes
fragmentation of the right door and consequently harm its unity and clarity.
Ecolo wants to generalize the right to sue to all non-profit organizations, in
limits their social purpose, developing general rules that all associations
could avail themselves, provided they meet a number of conditions and for
some tags.
Two bills have, therefore, been lodged fédéral6 Parliament. Both aim to
generalize this right of action; one before the Council of State and the other before the courts and tribunals.

Proposal: Successful reform of the judiciary
After long working group's work Atomium Ecolo which was associated, reform
the judiciary was finally passed in the Federal Parliament. However, the methodology of the group
Atomium based on an extended consultation of judicial actors, was not pursued at
the development of reform, choices that may undermine the implementation and applicability to
ground realities of measures passed. Ecolo ensure that the implementation of the reform
allows to achieve concrete improvements, both to the litigant than for members

in particular, by granting fair and decent budgets to the courts.
Ecolo supports the philosophy of the reform for increased specialization of judges while
ensuring that basic services litigants are treated in each place of the hearing. Ecolo
ensure that the implementation of this reform maintain a close Justice of litigants,
including through the preservation of hearing locations and transplantation as well as basic services
each division8.
Judges and court staff are also subject to the new rules of mobility.
These should allow greater specialization of judges, in accordance with the
human situation of each individual. In addition, the new rules will allow for mobility
reallocate human resources (judges and court staff) where they are most
necessary. Ecolo also requests that the measurement of the charging lead quickly travail9
to avoid that judges are not subjected to excessive mobility, lack of frameworks
correct and sufficient.
In this context, Ecolo offers greater democratization of the judiciary through a
increased role of the general assembly of judges in each court or prosecutor in decision
decisions relating to the mobility of members of the judiciary (eg by
representation on the steering committee of the new courts) or on
Business specializable concentration in a division. The participation of magistrates
decisions ensures greater adherence to the decisions of commanding officers and avoid
up the risks of a disguised disciplinary decision.
The judicial districts spend from 27 to 12 units instead of 16 as recommended the
Atomium group. The federal government has therefore decided to marry boundaries
provinces by the boroughs. This political choice ignores living areas nor
ground realities and the number of concernés10 litigants.
The differences between districts will be too great for each district
weighs the same weight in the future College of courts and tribunals. This College will negotiate
budgets that will be allocated to courts and tribunals in the context of the reform on
their management autonomy. Ecolo calls for all boroughs, and therefore all
litigants to be heard in this College.
Ecolo also supports the objective of autonomy and accountability of the courts in
management of their operating budgets. But these principles can only lead to a dilution
political responsibilities to the judicial actors that do not influence the choices
budget - and the current budget situation - imposed by the government.
Furthermore, Ecolo opposes the will of the Minister of Justice and the Federal Government
subjecting the judiciary to the interference of the executive. For Ecolo, control
the use of budgets by the judiciary can be done by the House or by the Court
Accounts (under the House), but in any case by the executive. Envelopes
budget allocated to the courts should be the subject of an annual budget law
Judicial approved by the House.

For Ecolo, it is appropriate to postpone the effective date to September 1, 2014 to serenely prepare
implementation and avoid a false start awaited reform for too long.
8
The new districts are geographically divided into divisions, which should match - in all cases
initially - to former boroughs. The hearing locations will be organized in the capital of the
divisions.

See our proposals on the part of judges to fight against the backlog of cases.

The average size of a judicial district is 900 000 inhabitants per borough. By comparison, the
Atomium group had chosen 16 districts and an average of 600 000 inhabitants per district.

Proposal: To translate the legal vocabulary in a common language
Ecolo offers a great acts of reformulation site is launched under the aegis of the Council
Higher Justice. The objective is to facilitate access "semantic" to justice and the right to
allow a maximum of citizens and citizens to understand his language, read its
judgments, queries or quotes bailiffs. The dignity of the justice and legal certainty
will undoubtedly be preserved by using more understandable terms.

Proposal: Making laws legible and consistent with each other
"No one is supposed to ignore the law." However, with an annual average of 100 laws, decrees
royal and circulars issued by the Department of Justice, no one is able to follow
pace of legislative frenzy. The proliferation of sources of law (including regional or
Community) and the use of these sources of their regulatory power accentuate
more movement, while upsetting the legal landscape. Neither the actors - police, magistrates,
lawyers, legal assistants - or litigants manage to meet the popular saying
in such a context. This situation undermines the legal certainty and predictability
standards, fundamental principles of our rule of law. It reduces the citizen's right to a Master
and a minimum knowledge of the rule and increases the administrative burden of the actors, forced
to follow different laws.
In this context, Ecolo offers, like the work done for the new Economic Code
and code of social criminal law, Parliament begins a work of revision, coordination and
rereading of legislation, to improve their readability and consistency between
various existing texts. This is a real democratic challenge. Ecolo proposes to start
by the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Penal Code based on the work done during the
"Grand Franchimont".
Furthermore, the texts of Justice laws are increasingly voted in
the urgency and immediacy. For the quality of legislation, it is appropriate to avoid voting texts
within the scope of the emotion born of exceptional circumstances encountered in society.

Proposal: Establish a transparent complaints management procedure and
adopt the reform of the disciplinary procedure for judges
Individuals may feel deprived or victims of a miscarriage of justice when decisions are
misunderstood when some actors show "dishonest". To reconcile, explain or correct
this type of situation, Ecolo proposes to introduce, via the High Council of Justice11, a
procedure for handling complaints from litigants transparent, independent and useful
all parties. Ecolo supports such a reform, which unfortunately avortée12
provided that the Higher Justice Council receives and monitors the citizens' complaints.
These complaints may concern the functioning of the judiciary and the behavior
its members (judges, court clerks, prosecutors and substitutes).
On the disciplinary level, the reform of the disciplinary procedure has finally succeeded. For Ecolo, the
new procedure must always respect and ensure security of tenure and independence of judges.
Furthermore, the new disciplinary tribunals will have a comprehensive framework. Indeed, the

11

The CSJ can currently handle only complaints about malfunctioning of the judiciary. The complaints
Foreign individual or the functioning of the judicial system are increasing. The CSJ must declare
incompetent and leave it alone and helpless litigants continue another procedure for the complaint to be processed. " It is
essential that citizens' complaints are directed as soon as possible to the competent authority for
they can be transacted "(2006 annual report of the CSJ, p. 92)
12
The bill passed in March 2010 has lapsed following the elections of June 2010. Unfortunately,
Federal majority has not made a priority, and four years later, the reform has not yet emerged.

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter JUSTICE AND PRISONS - p 8/25

workload of such courts should be evaluated according to a new context in
the judiciary, which encourages greater mobility of judges and judiciaire13 staff.
Finally, the judges assessment procedure is a failure and must be reformed
depth. It makes it possible not to distinguish between possible improvements
helpful, those required or even (as appropriate) and essential breaches
duties of charge14. Furthermore, the assessment procedure of commanding officers, who keep an
essential role in the new disciplinary proceedings, declared unconstitutional by the Court
Constitution in 2010, has still not been reformed. To ensure greater legitimacy and
leadership corps commanders - as soon managers - Ecolo calls for quick review
this procedure.

Proposal: Integrating environmental harm in civil law
Our current law does not effectively repair the damage caused to the environment.
Indeed, the courts can not in most cases rely on the common law
public liability. The problem is that it requires to demonstrate the fault, damage
and a causal link.
Just like what was done in other countries15, Ecolo wants the harm principle
Environmental is introduced into our civil code. This principle allows any individual
or entity (including association or local authority) to compensation for damage
purely environmental, regardless of the damage and / or injury
moral, even when the damage has no character "personal" (target damage).
This principle is complementary to the polluter pays principle adopted by the OECD in 1972, contained
in the Single European Act signed in 1986.

PRIORITY 2: GET JUSTICE WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME
A society in which judicial decisions - the punishment or a finding of innocence - is the
fruit of a process that lasts for years, is a company that does not guarantee a fair trial.
Often, after all these years, repairing the damage is no longer possible, the amendment
the author is no longer possible, the feeling of impunity among perpetrators and insecurity
among the victims and citizens is established. Where acts of aggression are committed, authority
Public must make a rapid, fair and proportionate. Improved deadlines
procedures must be met by a series of interlocking measures.

Proposal: Establish a true computerization of Justice
Several years after the failures of the Phoenix Project Cheops, it is urgent to implement
an ambitious project to computerize procedures and services should result so
comprehensive, unified, efficient and adapted to realities on the ground.
This includes driving to continue work to digitize records, to generalize
the use of electronic correspondence (including sending and filing of pleadings and
Parts), remote consultation of civil and criminal procedure cases (including the
13

Appeals against disguised disciplinary sanctions, such as a transfer decision will be filed before these
new disciplinary tribunals.
14
Ecolo argued during the debate on reform of the disciplinary procedure, for the development of more detailed provisions
that the current Article 404 of the Judicial Code. The "Guide for magistrates: principles, values ​​and qualities" written initiative
by the High Council of Justice and the Advisory Council of the Judiciary is a first step but calls for Ecolo
a revision of the legal provisions.

law enforcement records), all with guarantees of confidentiality, security and authentication
essential to the judicial function.

Proposal: Revaluate Justice by human and budgetary resources
For Ecolo, rapid Justice, fair and proportionate can not be done in a context of
linear measures of fiscal restraint. Restrictions were imposed on the courts and
Federal courts by the outgoing Government, undermining the continuity of the functioning of
courts and the fight against the backlog of cases. Include the episode of Circular 154 and the delay
volunteer in the appointments of new judges, late payment of court experts
or the removal of 6% of the budget of the houses of Justice. Justice also suffers
a backlog means and reforms. Ecolo calls for a revaluation of the judiciary,
both in terms of human resources and financial.
The backlog of the Brussels district - and the Court of Appeal, in particular - is
shocking, particularly with regard to guarantees of a fair trial within a reasonable time.
In this context, the fixing of a part of members of the judiciary (judges, court and
judiciary) courses and courts of Brussels as part of the sixth reform
State - which participated Ecolo - is a step forward and a hope for litigants Brussels
to be tried within a reasonable time.
For Ecolo, so it is urgent to achieve the measure of the workload in all
districts to adapt over the frameworks and objectively courts
transparent to the results of that measure. Moreover, executives of judges, but also
clerks and court staff, must be complete and replacements must be
insured without carry, at the risk of jeopardizing the efforts against the judicial backlog.

Proposal: Adapting generating procedures wasted time
Many unnecessary procedures could be avoided by adjusting certain procedures code
judicial. Provided that the rights of the parties and the defense are equally respected,
Ecolo proposes to give probative simplified acts that promote the implementation of
uncontested measures or conciliation, without judicial intervention.
Our judicial system is not always able to "absorb" all matters to him
submitted. In some cases big business - often financial or tax evasion - is
notes that the judicial actors are not equipped to provide legal response
a reasonable time. Ecolo proposes to initiate a broad discussion on judicial proceedings and
Extrajudicial to determine the procedure and state the most appropriate response in order to
respect the laws by all. The example of the procedure "Una via" 16 for tax fraud
a good track that deserves a wider reflection.

PRIORITY 3: DEVELOPING A COMMON STRATEGY OF LUTTRE AGAINST
JUVENILE DELINQUENCY BETWEEN FEDERAL STATE AND COMMUNITIES
17

Since the institutional reform laws of 1980, the Federal State and the Communities
were in a state of mutual dependence regarding juvenile justice have

16

The Act of 20 September 2012 establishes the principle of "Una via" as part of continuing offenses
fiscal and tax majorant criminal fines. This principle made the choice to a single lane, that is to say, a folder
tax evasion should be treated either administratively or through criminal proceedings. To find our proposals
for tax fraud, see the priority of the Chapter 11 and Chapter "banking and financial regulation."

committed an act qualified as an offense, since, on the one hand, the federal had jurisdiction to determine the
measures that could be taken by a juvenile court against minors who have committed
an act qualified as an offense, while the Communities were competent to implement
these measures.
The Communities were therefore responsible for implementing court decisions taken on
basis of a law they did not have the power to change.
The sixth state reform modifies it, transferring to the Communities and the Commission
Brussels Common Community care to enact the measures that can be taken by a judge
with regard to minors who have committed an act qualified as an offense.
For Ecolo, so as to establish a common strategy against crime
between the Federal State and the Communities, it is urgent to optimize the transfer of an agreement within
balisera concrete cooperation that which will increase the Communities and Federal. In this
same purpose, the transfer will be subject to regular review.
There will also be strengthened dialogue between the judges and the Communities in that
must contain future Community legislation, particularly in terms of content of the measures
which will be available to judges in response to the delinquency of a young, these remaining
dependent on resources made available by the Communautés18.

PRIORITY 4: DEVELOP A REAL FIGHT AGAINST POLICY
RACISM, AND SEXISM Homophobia
Racism, xenophobia, sexism and homophobie19 are not expressed only in their
the most visible form (physical abuse, beatings, rape and even murder). To
Daily, they also result in reactions, conscious or not, rejection, exclusion
(verbal or written insults, mockery, humiliation, harassment, contempt, denial of service,
damage to property and discrimination). They occur in all areas of life
private and public.
Despite the anti-discrimination arsenal available to Belgium at all levels of power,
prejudices persist and homophobia, sexism and racism persist. Worse, they sometimes
kill.

Proposal: To ensure prevention and training of frontline actors
To be effective, the fight against racism, xenophobia, sexism and homophobia can not
limited to a criminalization of such acts. It must also go through the implementation of an ambitious
prevention policy, especially in schools.
Explain the diversity, reassure, raise awareness to the acceptance of sexual orientation and identity
gender is essential.
It is also essential to educate and train police personnel, relief and
members of the judiciary who may face these issues in their work.

Proposal: Make effective prosecution
Ecolo wants the circular (ORF13 / 2013) which requires floors to make the fight against these
conduct one of their priorities is the subject of regular review. Generally,

collecting annual statistics on investigations, prosecutions and sanctions imposed
should be systematized and published.
Ecolo also proposes to include sexism as such in anti-discrimination legislation
and recognize the notions of identity and expression genre.20 In addition to sexism Register
as such in anti-discrimination legislation, the proposal also incorporates y
notion of identity and gender expression.

PRIORITY 5: GIVE MEANING TO PENALTIES FOR VICTIMS, AND THE AUTHORS
THE SOCIETY
In our legal system, the sentence must be meaningful to all concerned. She
must allow the victim to feel understood and considered and the offender to take
awareness of the harm caused. It must also be coherent with respect to the rules of living together
that society is responsible for protecting.
The evolution of our societies, in the context of criminal and prison overcrowding inflation,
invites us especially to put the question of the meaning of the sentence and evaluate diversification.

Proposal: Diversify penalties
Besides the prison sentence and the fine, many alternatives have been created since
a few years and can regularly be better suited for certain types of
offenses, in particular where those interested are able to accountability and
want a pardon. They are however underutilized.
To encourage the use of these alternatives, it is essential to strengthen their credibility and
their effectiveness, and build a dimension of "compensation" to the victims or
their relatives and society as a whole. As prison sentences should these alternatives
also subject to regular evaluations to assess the relevance and impact
(especially with regard to recidivism) but also to verify that the objectives that led to their
establishment are actually achieved. These goals are not only the punishment-retribution
but also education and redress.
Ecolo proposes to continue to diversify the penal and justice to develop a more
Restorative through, for example, the professional order (obligation of means and not of
results), the obligation to give back to the community, the obligation to take part in projects
social reintegration, participation in social missions in Belgium ...
Ecolo also proposes that the penalty of confiscation becomes an autonomous sentence. It is indeed
likely to have a significant deterrent effect, especially for tax offenses or
economic. For Ecolo, should nevertheless remain vigilant, particularly in those
materials, that the development of alternative punishments did not result in lead
a real class justice, as is currently the case with pénale21 Transaction.
This provides for, a person who has the means to pay can escape for some
crime, for sentencing.
The establishment of a more restorative justice also raises the question of the inclusion of some of
sanctions criminal record.

Proposal: Electronic surveillance as
real alternative to detention
Introduced in 1998 in our country, electronic monitoring is increasingly
used. Until recently, this form of monitoring was with us that execution modality
a prison sentence. Recently, this system was extended to two new categories
people. A simplified version of electronic monitoring, house arrest (or
electronic monitoring by voice recognition) is now implementing for
persons serving a sentence of less than eight months in prison and the GPS band may be
used in place of preventive detention.
In view of the advances in technology and the extension of this method of control, it is necessary to
Ecolo eyes to evaluate the different modalities and effects, before continuing the expansion. he
is also equally important to organize a debate, particularly regarding the ability of the
electronic monitoring to substitute for incarceration.
Moreover, if the use of electronic monitoring in lieu of detention seems
have a positive impact on the non-recurrence and allows the person not to cut any link
social, family and professional, it is not suitable for all situations (eg violence
domestic, pedophilia with victims living in the neighborhood) and requires, whatever its
shape, psychosocial care.
It should also ensure that electronic monitoring is not an alternative to
probation, a suspended sentence or restoration to outright freedom but true
alternative to detention. Finally, the involvement of private companies must be strictly limited to
technical intervention. These private companies of interference problems in the process of
Monitoring will remain valid despite the transfer of the National Electronic Surveillance Centre
the Communities.

PRIORITY 6: OUT interned PEOPLE IN PRISON
The case of internees, locked in prisons is one of the scandals of our system
judicial. In Belgium there are three types of places of internment: defense establishments
actual social (in French-speaking Belgium), directly under the Ministry of
Justice (SPF Justice), certain psychiatric hospitals (public or private) that accept internees
under the Social Protection Act and psychiatric annexes to prisons. The latter, created
in 1921 as a place of observation commissioning, gradually transformed into place
provisional detention pending a transfer of the internee to a defense establishment
social, then instead of long-term detention, particularly because of the constant
saturation of social defense institutions (EDS).
These psychiatric annexes, which are the most overcrowded prisons are spaces
designed for the confinement of offenders and not treating people with
mental illnesses. They are not adapted to psychiatric care and no therapy can
be seriously implemented. These are, in fact, real car parks for such persons

awaiting transfer to a specialized institution. This situation has already earned Belgium
several convictions by the European Court of Human Rights.
For Ecolo, internees must urgently leave the annexes to prisons and take
instead in traditional care circuits, because it is sick people who need
care.
The law called "Social Protection" provides that the judge may ask for a
litigant who has committed a crime, a psychiatric report. Based on this expertise, if the judge
believes that the person was indeed responsible for his actions, the procedure is ongoing and is
res. Otherwise, the person is not considered and is interned for a period

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter JUSTICE AND PRISONS - p 13/25

indefinite during which she will receive the care necessary for his rehabilitation. His release,
temporary or permanent, will intervene only when it is deemed fit to regain his freedom by
Mental Health Board. In theory, this system has the advantage not to send in prison
People who have committed crimes in delirium episodes and their example
provide the necessary care. But it also poses many problems.
The first is the lack of space in the EDS (social protection establishments); many
"Internees" are then placed in psychiatric annexes to prisons whose framework is not
at all suitable. But the investment EDS is also often a cul-de-sac: many
people languish there for several decades, which has altered their mental health
extent that output is no longer an option, so that initially the offense was minor. The news
intervention policies in place are insufficient to truly relieve the
system. The second problem is the lack of space in traditional care circuits
(hospitals, sheltered housing, specialized institutions for the disabled, ambulatory monitoring ...).
The prison side, many untried prisoners liable to suffer from real problems
mental health, without receiving adequate care. Thus, detainees are sentenced and then
released "penalty bottom" without any psycho-social support has been made and without it having
any guarantee of absence of recurrence.
On the merits, the law therefore raises questions because the vision of justice is binary (one is
responsible or you do not), which is not often the psychological reality or
psychiatric. The responsibility of a person who has committed a crime is relative, and the failure
to recognize minimum liability does not help the person to rehabilitate himself. It is
also recalls the recent controversies that have arisen between experts on the issue of
responsibility of high profile trials in Belgium and elsewhere in Europe where
similar system exists.
One can also ask the question of the appropriateness of detention for people who have
committed minor crimes and are not a priori a danger to society, while a
Main objectives of this law is to protect it.
Ecolo proposes to open a wide debate on this issue, including on the spirit of the law.
The state must provide the means to provide all citizens with problems of
mental health, whether in prison, interned or free health care as their condition
requires.

PRIORITY 7: FIGHTING PRISON OVERCROWDING
The causes of prison overcrowding are diverse and known. Among these include a
overuse of preventive detention, longer and accumulated penalties, recourse
less and increasingly late for parole and the presence in prison
people whose mental condition requires care in care facilities.
Addressing these causes requires courage because it means deconstructing the real causes
failure of prisons. Until now, successive governments have preferred to choose the solution
facility still building more prisons, that is to say, by perpetuating a system that does
does not work, avoiding asking the right questions.

Proposal: To ensure preventive detention an exceptional use
Currently, pretrial detainees represent 35% of the prison population. However, detention
Preventive should remain the exception and can not be used as a means of pressure or
anticipation of punishment. Its impact on the prison population is all the more important that
also influences the level of the sentence imposed by the trial judge. Its impact on
overcrowding is therefore not limited to the number of defendants.

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter JUSTICE AND PRISONS - p 14/25

For Ecolo, it must, in consultation with judges and investigating courts:
develop and invest in alternatives to detention to make them
effective and credible;
limit preventive detention to the most serious cases (crimes and offenses against
people ; criminal organizations; etc.).
Ecolo also proposes developing the convening by the minutes for flagrant offenses. he
This is a document that the public prosecutor gives directly to the person who replaces
quote: she mentions the alleged facts and the place, date and time of the hearing. This
procedure less costly than quote by bailiff is still too little used,
particularly against the homeless or undocumented, so that it is an alternative
effective to the arrest warrant.

Proposal: Apply and extend the law "Salduz"
"Reform Salduz" allows the person deprived of liberty to be assisted by his lawyer during
first interrogation. For Ecolo, should:
To ensure its implementation and its financing;
To adapt it to the judgment of the Constitutional Court and the European Directive
on the right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings and the right to
communicate upon arrestation22;
After an evaluation, improve and expand the law to allow all players
work in a quick and avoid the extension of police custody;
Allow a real dialogue between the lawyer and his client and a more active role
lawyer during interrogation;
To allow the lawyer's assistance to any person suspected (even if not owned)
and for victims who so wish;
To provide audio-visual recording of interrogations.

PRIORITY 8: REDEFINING THE POLITICAL PRISON
In our society, the prison sentence is still too often seen as the only true
sanction. But its unique feature at present is to remove from society for a time,
person representing a hazard (more or less) for the rest of the population. In the
most cases, this separation is only temporary, once the sentence carried out, the person shall
indeed find a place in society.
It is doubtful that the fact of a person locked in a cramped and overcrowded cell,
in degrading living conditions, without a minimum coaching, psychological counseling
and reintegration assistance, will help make amends and regain a place unhindered in
company. Yet these are the objectives of the Dupont 2005 law but which most
provisions have still not entered into force due to lack of political will. Improve
Yet prison policy has a genuine interest in the company.

Proposal: Enhancing the status and function of prison officer
improve working conditions
Ecolo proposes to develop an ambitious prison staff training policy
take greater account of the realities on the ground, so that it is as fully recognized
in his role. The prison officer function should indeed be a separate profession because
beyond its monitoring functions, the agent must also have a social sense, listening,
patience and psychology. If he does not perform the functions of the social worker and / or
psychologist, it is nevertheless the link between these people and the prisoner, being in first line. Those are
So the qualities that must be part of the selection criteria during the engagement.
The revaluation of the function (which can not be at the expense of other categories
Prison workers) also requires an improvement in working conditions for agents
prisons both human and material. To this end, Ecolo offers to work
consultation with prison staff so that their demands are heard, the
realization of these demands is the subject of negotiated agreements with the directions of
prisons and / Minister of Justice. Agreements meeting expectations
workers and must thus afford to avoid getting in strikes that deprive
detainees achieving certain basic needs.

Proposal: Improve the organization of life in prison in accordance with the
2005 law on internal legal status
Belgian prisons are pressure cookers, due to overcrowding, the
living conditions in prisons and the lack of vision about their role in the reconstruction of
individuals, beyond the normal and legitimate fulfillment of the punishment to which they were
convicted.
In the interest of society, Ecolo proposes to reform the organization of life in prison and
ensure proper status of detainees first step in their reintegration into
company :
Implement the law on the legal status of detainees, passed in 2005 and the
complete provisions on the organization of the prison system (intervention
Each actor and actress and collaboration between headquarters, prisons, services
psycho-social and medical services). The few provisions already in force must also
be assessed;
Improve conditions of detention, fighting against casualization and develop life
Social inside the prison. Indeed, promiscuity, difficulty ensuring its needs
vital and reducing social contacts lead to more social alienation, especially
more that sentences are getting longer. Pending more structural solutions,
solidarity mechanisms among inmates implemented in some institutions (such as
mutual aid funds) should be supported and encouraged;
Establish effective collaboration between the federal and the federated entities to
strengthen the policy of socio-educational supervision of inmates and detainees, access
in training, education or work. All this contributes to the reduction of
recidivism by better preparing the individual for reintegration;
Adapting infrastructures: human scale, facilitating the secure movement of
prisoners and prison officers and not overcrowded. Sound management of
issues within the Buildings Agency is therefore crucial. Indeed, it can not
do serious work reintegration in small structures. Rather than creating
additional places within the large existing structures, it is therefore
more advantageous to replace our existing prisons by smaller units than

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter JUSTICE AND PRISONS - p 16/25

not a capacity of 150 inmates. The project pilote23 "From huizen" proposed to prison
Oudenaarde on the principle of detention houses in this direction and deserves to be
extended to other prisons;
Separate inmates requiring extensive security measures of others.
Meanwhile, we must develop for little dangerous inmates, semiouvertes structures (as is already in Marneffe) or open, just like what is done in
Scandinavia (Norwegian prison Bastøy, for example);
Maintain prison management in the sovereign functions of the state and not the subcontract to private firms, more guided by profit and profitability as the
desire to limit recidivism. Even a limited privatization of certain services in the
prison, as happens in our new prisons, is not acceptable.

Proposal: Strengthen coordination between the SPF
Health and social security
In Belgian prisons, access to health care or work is the responsibility of the Service
Federal Public Justice. The detainee is fully supported by the administration
prison and no longer benefits from social security or mutual.
In health care, this type of organization poses numerous problems including the issue
the independence of caregivers in relation to the prison.
If the outright transfer of health care in prison of Justice to Public Health is
undesirable - particularly because of the distribution of powers in this area between
Federal and Communities - other intermediate runs are possible.
A recommendation from the Council of Europe recommends that the Ministry of Health should
have a wider responsibility in areas such as assessment of health,
assessing the adequacy of health care organization in schools
Prison, the various ministries to have a health policy
concerted and integrated;
Place directly on prison health care service under the authority of the Federal Justice rather than
under that of the Director General of Prisons;
Consider a reform of the social security system for those detained and under
electronic monitoring to facilitate the employment contract as a condition of
reclassification. In health, they should also benefit from care
Health supported by the system of health care, like any insured.

Proposal: Improve health care in prisons and provide
adequate response to users drogues24
While in theory, the detention does not, with respect to the outside, differences in accessibility
nor in the quality of care, the ground reality is different. Access to care is difficult for
inmates: Flash consultations (talks about two minutes per visit) and suspicion
systematic simulation that detainees are no longer appeal to doctors or do too
later. Staff shortages forcing nurses to get help from supervisors for
tasks for which they are not trained. Sometimes there is no permanence the weekend.

The sanitary facilities are old and inadequate, outdated medical equipment. The

For Ecolo, should be developed and generalized prevention programs while
having an overall view thereof, particularly in the fields of food or
hygiene.
As for drugs, all people who have a problem of addiction or
could develop, must be supported and followed consistently by
specialized services.
Risk reduction is another aspect inseparable from the problem of drugs and
addiction. Indeed, prisons are places that concentrate high rates of HIV
or viral hepatitis. The high risk of contamination in prison is explained by the fact
the sharing of injecting equipment is common. A reduction policy
effective and suited to risk prison to be established.
Monitoring set up should also aim to provide a continuity of care for
inmates entering and leaving prison, as already exists in other European countries.

Proposal: Consider the situation of children detained persons
When an incarcerated woman has a very young child or give birth in prison, the child under
three years can stay alongside his mother in the prison world. The underlying principle in this
"Home" is to allow the creation - or avoid breaking - the link between attachment
mother and baby.
It is fundamental to determine the optimum conditions of life for the benefit of young children.25.
Currently, Belgium, women's facilities do not have a specific unit
to accommodate pregnant women and mothers with infants. Some were
"Equipped" accordingly and few cells were equipped to accommodate a
mother and child. Few things are done by cons to foster contacts between the
children and their father. These improvements of existing infrastructure are difficult and remain
clearly insufficient to satisfy the basic needs of children brought to stay in
jail.
The reception of infants in detention occurs without reference, without a protocol
Joint collaboration on all relevant entities without specific home project. He exists
Yet a guide of good practices, European recommendations and experiences
proven.
For Ecolo, it should therefore be:
Create mother-child homes scheme (half) -open. These houses, separate buildings
the prison would be reserved exclusively for mothers and their children
very young ;
Ensuring reception conditions necessary for the well-being of children in prisons
closed;

25

In accordance with Article 20 of the Convention on Child Rights and Article 93 of the Havana Rules.

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter JUSTICE AND PRISONS - p 18/25

Ensure collaboration between the different actors concerned by a situation
individual, a parenting support to parents and prisoners future mothers
held, training and sensitization of prison officials;
Organize, by agreement, shared responsibilities and mixed financing
the home of the child in detention between child sectors, prison sector
the voluntary sector funded and approved;
Encourage the use of alternatives to preventive detention when the accused is
pregnant or has young children;
Allow the mother to have primarily home leave in order to participate
actively contacts can have a child with the outside (medical examinations,
visiting nurseries, family visits);
Provide in each prison, a space and infrastructure are
equipped for the children who come to visit one of their parents, and allow
for families to get together, even when both parents are detained.

PRIORITY 9: DEVELOP POLICY ENFORCEMENT OF PENALTIES
COHERENT and individualized

Proposal: Set clear rules and sensitize the judiciary
For Ecolo, it is essential to establish a clear sentences and execution policy
consistent. This requires laws and not kept secret for ministerial circulars
and communicated to certain judges. Similarly, cooperation between the different levels
power must be maintained and strengthened.
For the system to be consistent, it is equally important to train magistrates in the execution
penalties. It is absurd that the judges who sit on the court enforcement of sentences
receive mandatory specific training, so that judges people by sending
Prison receive no special training.
Ecolo therefore proposes that the judges and prosecutors, as part of their training
continuous receive training in penology, criminology and site visits
prison.

Proposal: To ensure the efficient operation of
Courts Application of Sentences (TAP)
Ecolo request an evaluation of the functioning of the courts application of penalties (TAP) to
to optimize. This optimization would allow among others to entrust the implementation of Judges
penalties jurisdiction to enforce sentences of less than 3 years.
An additional means and the settlement of the issue of overcrowding, the judge
application of penalties should also be competent to take decisions of tours
short or exceptional leave, interrupts the execution of the sentence and releases
temporary, remaining until now the responsibility of the executive. Otherwise, this skill
exerted by the prison management should be regulated by a legal text (and not a
circular, as is currently the case).
To allow the Tribunal Penal Enforcement can position themselves in proper time,
including the advisability of parole requires that the records of people
inmates are ready when they appeared. This is the psychosocial service of the prison who drafts
the opinion on whether to grant parole or other measure (Bracelet

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter JUSTICE AND PRISONS - p 19/25

electronic …). Now this service is understaffed and has seen its resources reduced by
outgoing government. It is therefore necessary to make it the means of its action.
Finally, Ecolo advocates that TAP are also found competent defense
social and, in this context, a psychiatrist or psychologist replaces the specialist assessor
prison terms and a special room is devoted to this matter.

Proposal: Prepare the sentence or after release from prison
Many detainees, especially the poorest and most poorly educated, experience
difficulties in reintegrating into society. Some face the loss of family relationships,
employment and housing. For others, the descent into hell follows known paths, including
classic is a lack of resources (and the inability to find work without certificate
of good character), so housing, permanent address and help the CPAS The only way out is ...
so sometimes the return to communities where they committed the crimes that led them into prison.
There, in the Dupont Act 2005 which governs the rules of life in prison, important provisions
to prepare the post-sentencing and release from prison: each prisoner, from his prison entrance,
prepares his reintegration, including through the establishment of a detention plan. These provisions
unfortunately still not in force at present.
We see instead that prisoners are left to themselves. Psychosocial services
can no longer exercise their functions of social workers, are mainly absorbed by the
expert missions. The aid missions fall therefore on aid services to accused
dependent communities, which are underfunded. There are currently in prisons
Ittre, Nivelles or Andenne a 2-year waiting list to meet with a psychologist.
The prison work opportunities are very limited and access to work is still too often
considered as a favor that can be withdrawn at any time. Under the 2005 law,
prison labor is a right. To make this right effective, labor supply must be expanded and
must be accompanied by social rights enjoyed by all workers.
Ecolo therefore proposes to rapidly enter into force on detention plan that will allow the
held to be ready for reintegration, either at the end of his sentence or for a possible
conditionnelle26 release.
For the same purpose, it must be concluded effective cooperation agreements between the federal and
federated entities for the federated entities can offer skills training
interesting and much more diverse than what currently exists.

Proposal: To better support the Houses of Justice and specialized services
The financial and human resources of Houses of Justice must be strengthened as they are
indispensable for the emancipation of "paralegal" sector compared to its mandating authorities
(judges, commissions and prisons). Ecolo further requests that
specialized private services also benefit from more resources, including personnel,
in order to ensure the daily monitoring of an increasing number of litigants to them
sent. If the ultimate aim of sentencing is the repair to the victim and society, we can not
tolerate services that participate in pilot projects operate fixed-term or
derisory budgets that allow them to provide more quality work. A better
Funding should be able to improve the working relationship between the prisoner and society, but also
the possibilities of alternatives to detention in a vision of successful social integration.
Following the sixth state reform, houses of Justice no longer depend on the federal state but
Communities. This transfer of powers will inevitably have consequences for
their functioning and their missions.
26

It would also allow a better consideration of compensation for victims, if any.

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter JUSTICE AND PRISONS - p 20/25

As part of this transfer, reflect on their articulation with the support services
litigants, victims and prisoners should be launched to establish an organization
optimal, both for victims and for (ex-) prisoners.
It will also establish quickly a common computer system for paralegal
relevant entities to ensure the exchange of basic information in this area.
Finally, in the Brussels region, it will also be careful to ensure that at least
harmonization of operating modes and consultations should be continued.

PRIORITY 10: ADAPT THE FAMILY RIGHT TO DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANY
Proposal: Establish the Family Court and Youth
Ecolo is pleased to see finally reaching reform aimed at creating a Family Court grouping
all skills in family matters, and forming a section of the Court of first instance. This
Court will have jurisdiction for all disputes related to separation, so that the entire
procedure can be handled by the same court, in order to reduce fragmentation, slow and
cost separations.
Similarly, child welfare issues are mostly related to
parenting issues, issues relating to the 1965 Act and the 1991 decree will be
also settled by the court, as the adoption procedure.
If in the Brussels Region, the magistrates did not wait for the passage of the law to create a section
"Family Youth" in the court of first instance, the reform still needs to be implemented
in other judicial districts to be effective on or before the judicial year
2014.
For Ecolo, the establishment of this tribunal, waited for over thirty years, can not suffer
budgetary restrictions.

Proposal: Encourage family mediation
For Ecolo, next mediation rooms at the Family Court should be set
up mediation structures that can intervene before the matter comes before the will
courts, which would avoid lengthy procedures, expensive and often carrying
negatively affect the relationships. It is particularly important to properly fund
the intervention of mediators in the context of legal aid.

Proposal: Set the practical consequences of the alterné27 accommodation

The necessary legislative amendments which Ecolo actively participated on
the objectification of the calculation of maintenance claims and alternate accommodation in case of children
parental separation, are not yet fully enforced. They must also be
supplemented to avoid unfair situations between parents.
Ecolo offers:
close existing gaps in the legislation concerned, such as those relating to
tax deduction for child care costs or child family allowances born of a
new union;

27

Also our proposals in Chapter "Equality Women - Men"

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter JUSTICE AND PRISONS - p 21/25

assess the case law since the adoption of these laws and degrees of satisfaction
parents, to change what needs to be or to invite judges to respect the spirit of
these laws;
to continue to improve the functioning of maintenance payments service (SECAL)
public service, integrated into SPF Finance, whose mission is to intervene in case of pensions
outstanding food, including the payment of the monthly advances to the creditor
of aliments28.

Proposal: Allowing the choice of name enfant29
At the beginning of XXI century in the context of a changing society, in particular with
regarding life choices, it is important to adapt the mode of transmission of the name to children.
The Institute for the Equality of Women and Men Press the Belgian political world to act,
stressing that Belgium violates international regulations on discrimination
kind. It recommends amending the Civil Code so that the names of both parents are passed
to their child and to ensure genuine equality between women and men. He exists
now a consensus to remove this inequality in our legislation concerning the name and
that the fact that fathers and mothers must be able to choose the family name of their
child.
Ecolo supports free choice of parents to assign their child either the father's name or the
name of the mother, or both names in the order chosen by them. From the second generation,
parents who carry a double name would choose the names of their children among their four
names, so that a child has more than two names joined as double name. The unit
the family name would prevail: the choice made for the first child worth to others
children of the same couple, so they all have the same nom30. The advantage of this
proposal is to support change in current mentality without forcing any
torque to follow. It thus allows the Civil Code provisions on transmission
patronymic to abandon their old clothes to enter Napoleonic walk-in
third millennium.

PRIORITY 11: COMBATING TAX FRAUD
Ecolo proposes to make the fight against tax fraud a real priority and to give the
financial, human and legal means of implementation.
The procedure "Una Via31" can guarantee the expected results on the condition of being
actually used in the field and to be associated with structural measures already
Recommended by conclusion of the Commission of inquiry into the large federal tax evasion,
initiated especially by Ecolo.
This is the case of:
the creation of a monitoring committee of services involved in the fight against
the various frauds (F Committee);
the granting of the status of judicial police officer in some ISI agents;
granting the power of search and seizure to the tax authorities, under the control of a
judge ;

The procedure "una via 'provides for collaboration between the FPS Finance and the prosecution to choose the quickest route

29

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter JUSTICE AND PRISONS - p 22/25

recruiting a sufficient number of tax assistants directly attached as
experts the prosecution or the investigating judge;
the creation of a "tax prosecutor 'service with the Court of Appeal and grouping
specialized prosecutors;
the introduction in the penal code of a sanctions regime for interim and
counselors who collaborate to fraudulent tax schemes.
In this context, Ecolo also calls for a review of the legislation on the transaction
criminal matters. Indeed, the legislation adopted in the outgoing legislature leads to true
class justice, enabling persons or companies suspected of financial fraud to in
draw too easily. It is necessary to revise the law.
In general, the fight against tax fraud must be a priority in
Judicial and police, particularly in the context of the National Security Plan. This also happens
through the provision of financial, human and legal enough.
All these measures must finally be subject to regular monitoring, including through the Court of
Accounts and reporting to Parliament.

Justice and Security
SECURITY POLICE AND FIRE
An improvement of the social contract
Status and political horizon
State of play
Security and insecurity
For environmentalists, living in a climate of security is an absolute right. Everyone should live
and move without fear for his physical or moral integrity.
On one hand, the feeling of insecurity feeds on various elements: the economic situation,
sociale1, environmental or health, road safety, delinquency phenomena, the
terrorism, abandoned buildings, vandalism ... These elements create together a climate
global uncertainty, diffuse anxiety, which pushes citizens to distrust and even
the withdrawal. However, Belgium is experiencing a positive development, the feeling of insecurity
down for almost ten years2.
On the other hand, in Belgium, although there are significant variations in the types
of offenses and crimes committed, the overall crime remains stable3. Surveys on
security problems, demonstrate that it is spontaneously insecurity linked to automobile traffic
is most often cited first, followed by aggressive driving in traffic and
various objects lying in the street. In urban areas, vandalism and trafficking of all kinds
(vehicles, drugs ...), contribute to the sense of insecurity. In everyday life, it is often
Insecurity linked to offenses committed against persons and property (made of burglaries
homes or car thefts, incivility, domestic violence) that is put forward,
especially in the media, and concerned. This shows that security issues do
not limited only to the fight against crime, but embrace a wide range of
phenomena, which should provide an appropriate response. The fight against all forms
insecurity involves monitoring and punishment are necessary but can not be
the only responses. In all cases, the construction of mutual trust and
protection of fundamental rights must also remain a priority.
Police services
In 1998, the establishment of the Integrated Police has strongly changed the organization of the police
local level, especially in pluricommunales police zones. If the reform had effects
positive, others are still waiting, especially regarding the "community policing".
Yet it allows direct contact with the citizen.
To cope with the difficulties and shortcomings of police, a series of devices
Additional gradually emerged since the early 90s, as contracts
safety and prevention. At the same time, the local police is seen more and more responsible
judicial missions, which leads her to abandon outreach. A series of tasks within

usually police function were often transferred to these local actors and to
private stakeholders parking control, security, monitoring public events ... The
Local police is then replaced by the "new uniforms" 4: prevention agents,
constatateurs agents, private security officers, etc. These changes require political
suitable for training, status, consistency and coordination to ensure
the effectiveness of security policies.
Police officers are often overwhelmed by administrative tasks that could be performed by
civilian members of the police. A range of policies are lagging: simplification
judicial and administrative police procedures, improved officer training ...
Reform "Salduz" which allows the person deprived of liberty to be assisted by his lawyer during
the first interrogation, has also had consequences for the organization of work
police services as well as in their relationships with lawyers. It should go further
this reform in order to improve portée5.
The municipal administrative sanctions
Meanwhile, criminal justice relocates trusting to common function
with jurisdictional taxation of municipal administrative sanctions against infringements
mixtes6. Local policies find themselves increasingly under the authority of local executive and not
over the judiciary. In addition to an endangered community policing missions of
local police, criminal justice and the protection of youth are gradually détricotées,
without the guarantees attached to the right to a fair trial.
Fire services
The authorities also organize the response to other security issues via
fire departments. These services have been waiting for seven years a reform that is struggling to translate
field as well as the appropriate means to ensure the safety of citizens and firefighters
in operation. Funding for this reform must go through alternative pathways to
municipal allocations, provincial and federal. Tracks such as recourse to financing
by insurance companies without affecting consumers, exist and should be put
implemented to relieve the finances of municipalities already being challenged by reform
fonts and other charges imposed by the federal government. Federal funding reform
fire services must be a goal of the next legislature. Fiscal neutrality
reform for municipalities must be guaranteed.
Security in Brussels after the sixth State Reform
Following the sixth state reform, the Brussels-Capital Region will exercise new
safety skills to strengthen coordination and improve security
the organization of the security services on its territory. Reform should, according Ecolo also
better coordinating between security priorities and those of Justice,
and between regional and local priorities.

Hybrid offenses are offenses of the Penal Code (under the judiciary) for which the legislator
authorizes the town to apply municipal administrative sanctions (different in each municipality). For
Ecolo, the concept of hybrid offenses, by its nature, is problematic under the principle of separation of powers
(executive body which is given legal skills) and the lack, at the administration
communal, legal guarantees provided by the judiciary. Ecolo believes that the reinforcement of the sanctions system
municipal administrative creates a parallel judicial system, less protective of the rights of the defense and guarantees
procedural.

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter SECURITY POLICE AND FIRE - p 2/24

The fight against terrorism
From the perspective of the evolution of the phenomenon of terrorism, the attacks of September 11, 2001 at
United States caused a shock wave that was reflected in the various legislations related
security worldwide. The European states, under pressure from their US ally, have adopted
laws more restrictive for fundamental freedoms of citizens, in the name of
fight against terrorism and organized crime. This legislative change specifically
disturbing was accompanied by a remarkable evolution of new technologies
of information and communication. The combination of these two phenomena caused
the emergence of a form of generalized electronic surveillance, introduced by service
intelligence and security Anglo-Saxon, with the excesses that we know in the case PRISM
of wiretap of most electronic conversations, including executives
allies. This widespread surveillance displayed aims to fight against the extreme violence and
organized crime but also plays a role in the political and economic espionage by the United States
their allies, including European.

The political horizon Ecolo
The improvement of the social contract and prevention
The mission of government is to ensure the safety of all citizens. If the
security inevitably requires effective policing, it also requires to carry
policies that offer each and everyone a subsistence protection, a secure living environment
and the possibility of having a place in society.
To do this, Ecolo proposes to improve the social contract to live together, by improving
prevention of insecurity. It is working on deterrence to commit an offense on
improving the living environment and spatial planning as well as on the causes of
delinquency. The issue of social and situational prevention must be seen as a
set of actions to prevent the passage to the offense and, more broadly,
fight against the risk of social exclusion. Ecolo promotes an integrated prevention policy,
respecting the specificities and approaches of each acteurs7, which are complementary
and work to improve the social8 contract.
Thoughtful security policy and coordinated with the judiciary
For Ecolo, security issues (or insecurity) therefore should not receive priority
a safe answer, but global. A response to the problems and feeling of insecurity
which is exclusively safe threatens democracy and the rule of law. The various forms
insecurity deserve appropriate responses.
Ecolo and adheres to the concept of "integrated security" that tend to more consistency in the
security policy, including its extension to other areas and actors outside
"traditional" sectors of the police and justice.
These responses require particular coordination between prevention policies,
criminal or security policy defined by the political authorities, means for services
Police and close coordination between the police and the judiciaire9. A joint which must
especially afford to work on a classification rate currently no further questioning
(76% of complaints), demotivating for frontline actors, often incomprehensible to
victims and creating a sense of impunity among the offenders.

7

Both the police and many other actors have a vital role to play in education, culture, integration
economic, socio-cultural associations sector in particular, land ...
8
Ecolo aims to improve everyone's safety through various programmatic proposals proposed
several chapters of the electoral program. All these proposals are therefore not included in this chapter.
9
The administration of criminal justice should be seen as a system in which actors from different institutions
interact: citizens, police, prosecution (if statement), trial courts and execution of the sentence.

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter SECURITY POLICE AND FIRE - p 3/24

Community policing
Ecolo wants a police model "local", that is to say, a policy oriented towards the
community, starting from the needs of the population and their objectives and subjective feelings
insecurity. A font to listen to citizens, who apprehends the problems and found with it
solutions ; which attempts to identify the causes and triggers of conflict or
crime; which develops specific proactive actions (supervised by standards) across
neighborhoods, network with partners. Ecolo also reaffirms its choice for a font
public, effective and guarantor of public order.
A fight against terrorism, respecting the rights of citizens
Ecolo believes that widespread surveillance of electronic communications and conversations
(see above) is an unacceptable change in the head of the intelligence services. Beyond
political protests, economic pressure against governments that practice
Such surveillance (via the suspension of negotiations of transatlantic free trade agreement with
the United States, for example) and the introduction of digital protection strategies Eco
calls for the Belgian and European intelligence services do not make this choice
policy and focus on more efficient methods to wiretap the
suspicious persons based on priorities and analysis they have defined.
In general, the protection of personal data is essential - whether in
contacts with the police and judiciary in the context of the use of cameras
monitoring or the exercise of private detective functions in the field of private security.
An effective fire service and the service of everyone
For Ecolo, the security of each and every one is a right for every citizen he lives in town or
rural areas. Thus, each person should receive adequate by the rescue services using
Fastest possible. This access to effective emergency services can not be hampered by
municipal limits or lack of means. The federal state must be the guarantor of this right,
can discharge its responsibility on municipalities. For Ecolo, responsibility
involves a real action and / or creativity to finance reform
emergency services. An effective fire service needs enough staff to go on
intervention. The firefighter must be valued and improved status.

The main points of the Ecolo project are:
Improve the social contract
Provide appropriate responses to the different forms of insecurity
Opting for a real community policing at the heart of society
Successful reform of public safety, for the protection of everyone
Bring to the terrorist threat a lucid and respectful answer and freedoms
fundamental rights

Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: IMPROVING THE SOCIAL CONTRACT
Fighting insecurity is primarily prevent it from happening. For this, there are various types
Prevention belonging to different players.
Prevention is particularly deterrence. Thus, greater policing in
streets (with specific assignments missions defined after analyzing the situation in the

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter SECURITY POLICE AND FIRE - p 4/24

neighborhoods and in consultation with the field) can help to prevent people from
take action.
Prevention also involves a reflection spatial planning, for example via
lighting in the streets and around the parks.
Prevention is also attempting to address the causes of crime, to tackle its
deep roots: education, culture, reducing inequality, employment and housing, development
planning, stimulation and regulation of economic activities in the collective interest. This is
why in the debates that concern the means of the state, environmentalists consider it necessary
focus on choices that enhance the quality of life in society. Ecolo intends to reduce the sense of
community and solidarity at the center of debates and décisions10.
In this context, regional and community policies must also take action
concerted oriented repair social links, based among others on action
coordinated local services, local actors and associations, communal services and CPAS.
Finally, a true partnership between stakeholders concerned with safety, so also and especially with
citizens is needed.

Proposal: Ensure the well-being and quality living environment
Improving the quality of public space, which strengthens as subjective safety (lighting ...)
and objective (fight against illegal parking, speeding ...) allows to feel good
in his neighborhood, reassures, gives the desire to participate in its maintenance and opens a virtuous circle
that benefits everyone. Urban renewal and improvement of the living environment should be
supported in coordinated interventions. For Ecolo, a joint where everyone feels
Safety is foremost a community where everyone has a place. This requires the development of
community life, sport and culture globally, by the positive occupation of public space
and appropriation by citizens: neighborhood parties or neighborhood, positive events
or art on public roads, greening or common cleaning operations
Public powers inhabitants ...
In addition, a set of policies should be carried out simultaneously: provide security
existence of each of (employment, income, housing ...), supporting social cohesion policies
(animations, community centers ...) and "sport for all" (inter-district football tournament ...).

Proposal: Better coordinate and support prevention devices
Prevention policies were put in place at all levels of power, mobilizing
sometimes important ways but without real coordination between them. The confusion is created
between situational prevention policies (personal safety) and social prevention
and between prevention and social cohesion policies. This creates a dispersion of
educational, or even competition between services in search of a "customer". When
prevention devices exist, it should therefore:
ensure coordination and increased cooperation between them and between
common, federated entities and the federal state;
clarify policies missions and funding for prevention and those
part of social cohesion;
to emphasize the collaboration between the different actors and actresses field (in the
respect for their conduct);
ensure greater participation of beneficiaries and stakeholders in the field
defining the objectives of prevention contracts;
10

For more information on the proposals for Ecolo in these matters, see the thematic chapters.

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter SECURITY POLICE AND FIRE - p 5/24

improve the efficiency of prevention policies and their possible restructuring
accentuate the social and preventive aspects in projects of prevention policies.
A clearer institutional architecture should enable each of these policies
meet their objectives;
to include projects over time;
harmonize and coordinate the practices of municipal services for prevention and
Safety drawing on successful experiences;
assess the implementation of security contracts whose evolution is positive in
several cities and begin a process of reflection on the philosophy that underlies them;
to preserve the resources allocated by the fund "European Summits" in neighborhoods
Brussels, including the proper use can contribute to security in the broad sense;
to train the actors of prevention policy and to achieve, by means
Further, actresses and social actors in their function and status.

Proposal: To provide targeted responses to specific needs
For Ecolo, a joint which everyone feels safe, it is above all a common
in which everyone has a place. Ecolo developing several programmatic proposals in
chapter on Youth to provide a place for minors and young offenders
in prevention policies, social cohesion and security.
Furthermore, Eco proposes to act vis-a-vis shopkeepers improving measures
"Techno-" and multiplying the information traders on legislation
Securing premises (video ...). For example, proposes to facilitate Ecolo
access by the prefinancing, the system "TV Police", enabling businesses to be
connected to a police incident.
Finally, it should ensure access to services of security and preventive training to
Public transport users, traders, elderly, etc.

PRIORITY 2: RESPONDING ADAPTED TO VARIOUS FORMS
OF INSECURITY
For Ecolo, the public authority must prevent and reduce the risk of crime but also act
directly deal with offenses against persons and property, to fight feelings
of impunity and insecurity. In addition, where acts of aggression are nevertheless committed,
importance of providing a rapid, fair and proportionate. Ecolo calls for a response
adapted to different forms of insecurity, a response that prevents possible recidivism and
favors repair. A response that takes into account the status of the victim and who proposes,
the author, alternatives to imprisonment as punishment ultime11.

Chapter "Justice and Prisons" is developing our proposals on diversity sanctions, the place of
victim and sense of worth.

Proposal: To ensure the safety of people with
special attention for women.12
Fight against violence against women, sexism, racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism
and homophobia displayed or unconscious is a change in society engine that must be
assumed by men and women to succeed and advance in all fields
which effective equality slow to achieve. In this perspective, parquet and Police must
the fight against these behaviors a priority, so that what discrimination
be they do not go unpunished. Regular assessment of the implementation of the circulaire13
adopted in 2013 will be conducted.
Ecolo proposes to make a more specific attention to security issues that affect them
women :
supporting organizations working with women victims of violence, with a
especially focus to the precarious public and of immigrant origin, less able to find
information about their rights in this area;
supporting associations that offer women's self defense courses,
conflict management, safety audits;
more in training social workers and police personnel questions
Family and domestic violence;
by multiplying the information through brochures, official documents and websites;
improving lighting in residential areas and access roads to the city center;
improving security in public transport facilities particularly through ad
hoc and personal reinforcement and / or police when necessary;
inserting the fight against family and domestic violence in all Zonal Plans
of security.
Finally, in the area of ​​the fight against all forms of violence against persons and,
in particular, the fight against discrimination, Ecolo promotes effective coordination
actors and devices.

Proposal: Fight against organized crime and fraud fiscale14
The fight against organized crime (slum landlords, human trafficking, etc.)
against financial crime (tax evasion, money laundering, etc.), should be strengthened.
It's about :
to ensure the means and coordinate the various specialized services that fight against
these forms of heavy delinquency;
to consider and reform useful devices to make possible legal proceedings;
ensure seizure and confiscation of systematic property and assets derived from activities
criminelles15.

12
Ecolo proposes to set up a real policy to fight against sexism and homophobia through prevention
and training of frontline actors (especially in monitoring rape and violence against women) and
to prioritize prosecutions of floors on the phenomena of sexism and homophobia. See Chapters "Justice and
Prisons "and" Gender Equality ".
13
COL 13/2013 of 17 June 2013 the Minister of Justice, the Interior Minister and the College of Prosecutors General
on the policy of investigation and prosecution in relation to discrimination and hate crimes (including the
discrimination based on sex).

Find our proposals in the fight against tax fraud in chapters "Taxation" and "Justice and
Prisons ".

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter SECURITY POLICE AND FIRE - p 7/24

The fight against crime, whatever it is, can not however initiate Protection
personal data of victims and offenders. It is therefore necessary to provide such protection
as part of data management and data banks.
Specifically, Ecolo proposes to make the fight against tax fraud genuine
priority and to provide the financial, human and legal to implement.
The procedure "Una Via" 16 can guarantee the expected results on the condition of being
actually used in the field and to be associated with structural measures already
Recommended by conclusion of the Commission of inquiry into the large federal tax evasion,
initiated especially by Ecolo.
This is the case of:
the creation of a monitoring committee of services involved in the fight against
the various frauds (F Committee);
the granting of the status of judicial police officer in some ISI agents;
granting the power of search and seizure to the tax authorities, under the control of a
judge ;
recruiting a sufficient number of tax assistants directly attached as
experts the prosecution or the investigating judge;
the creation of a "tax prosecutor 'service with the Court of Appeal and grouping
specialized prosecutors;
the introduction in the penal code of a sanctions regime for interim and
counselors who collaborate to fraudulent tax schemes.
In this context, Ecolo also calls for a review of the legislation on the transaction
criminal matters. Indeed, the legislation adopted in the outgoing legislature leads to true
class justice, enabling persons or companies suspected of financial fraud to in
draw too easily. It is necessary to revise the law, so that:
a transaction is no longer possible once the case is brought before the court
judgment ;
control by the back judge is still possible;
Penalty amounts are indicated in the law;
advertising of these agreements is assured and they appear in the criminal record of
interested.
In general, the fight against tax fraud must be a priority in
Judicial and police, particularly in the context of the National Security Plan. This also happens
through the provision of financial, human and legal enough.
All these measures must finally be subject to regular monitoring, including through the Court of
Accounts and a reporting to Parliament.

Proposal: Improve living together in the fight against incivilities
The fight against "incivility" as tags, illegal dumping, vandalism, etc. is of
would guarantee the social contract and improved living together. Emphasis must be placed both
on prevention, for example, by creating spaces of expression for urban arts or

15

See chapter "Justice and Prisons."
The procedure "una via 'provides for collaboration between the FPS Finance and the prosecution to choose the quickest route
and most effective, judicial or administrative.
16

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter SECURITY POLICE AND FIRE - p 8/24

sports facilities, carrying out information and awareness campaigns, etc. and on
Punishment, via constatateurs officials and sanctioning particular.
The municipal administrative sanctions (SAC) are part of the security policy of a
common. They must nevertheless be a last resort. For Ecolo, municipalities must
prioritize repair via mediation and citizen service first. The SAC must
always be predictable and applied with respect for fundamental freedoms and guarantees
and the rights of defense of the person concerned. But the SAC should not overcome the
weaknesses in the judiciary. It does not in fact accrue to the municipalities to bring the bill
federal. Moreover, the exercise of powers of the judiciary from the executive communal door
undermine the separation of powers and guarantees of fair trial.
Effective fight against antisocial behavior implies:
strengthen the judicial system instead of transferring power to a judge
Commons;
articulate and collaborate effectively to the judiciary and police services;
determine the action of the police by the prosecution policy defined by the prosecution
competent ;
to allow the judicial system and the protection of the youth monitor
sanctions imposed by adequate funding.
Furthermore, the Act of 24 June 2013 on municipal administrative sanctions stigmatizes
young people and excludes them from political life together in the town. The SAC system
towards minors is ineffective (applied to 1 or 2% for minors) and did not reach
minor's educational accountability since it is the parents who must
pay the fine. Ecolo therefore opposes the lowering of the minimum age for imposing sanctions
a mineur17.
Finally, the fight against incivility does not justify the reduction in guarantees of rule of law.
Therefore Ecolo denies that the Penal Code and fundamental freedoms in circumvention
increasing the extent of hybrid offenses, lowering the minimum age to 14 years to punish
minor or limiting the right to come and go of a person by prohibiting him access to a place
public. Ecolo therefore proposes an assessment and revision of the law on sanctions
administrative communales18.

Proposal: To ensure road safety
The road still kills too often. Moreover, road safety - or rather insecurity
road - can be an important factor of insecurity. Low said users
(elderly, disabled, children, cyclists, pedestrians) are the most exposed.
Investments that are devoted to voiture19 are incomparably higher than
granted to active modes and public transport. Road safety must allow
safe cohabitation between different users, weak and automobiles. To ensure and improve
the security of each and every one on the roads and their surroundings, proposes to make Ecolo
systematically into account the factor "road safety" in terms of development
territory and consider soft mobility in all road improvements.
For Ecolo, safety of vulnerable road users must be given special attention. Thus, Ecolo
offers:

villages (instead of providing deterrent car parks outside cities with efficient public transport service
shared), reluctance to the development of footpaths ...

ensure the rehabilitation of degraded and sidewalks to be strict on parking
"Wild" motor vehicles (parking on sidewalks or on crossings
for pedestrians);
multiply the bike paths, through agreements between neighboring municipalities of
generalize provisioning towpaths to the attention of cyclists;
identify the most dangerous areas and increase the number of zones 30, of cassevitesse clearly marked, floor of rétrécisseurs or any other technique for
to slow traffic in these areas, in consultation with stakeholders,
especially farmers in rural areas;
reinforce the prevention and repression of dangerous behavior: speed
excessive driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, stopping or parking
dangerous, etc. ;
ensure better articulation and coordination between the various actors in the
Judicial and police. Clearance rate without following traffic offenses is
qu'interpellant more. The floors are overwhelmed. They can no longer monitor
disputed transactions or are granted a low priority. A sense of impunity
develops and increases the number of repeat offenders. For Ecolo, floors must
(re) make traffic offenses a priority and should give them the means.
Finally, Ecolo calls for the implementation of cross-border cooperation agreements on
police. Specifically, Ecolo encourages cross-border cooperation agreements to
fight against speeding motorists with a foreign plate to allow
Belgian authorities to prosecute.

Proposal: To fight against environmental crime
The prosecution of environmental crimes is no longer part of the 10 priorities of the National Plan
Safety 2012-2015. Ecolo proposes to reintroduce it and accompany it with a real
policy to fight against environmental crime, including through:
the establishment of police teams trained in environmental law within
each police area;
development strategies adapted in collaboration with waste services;
informing citizens about the risks of sanctions and the sanctions;
better collaboration with the protection services of nature and forests.
Moreover, our current law does not effectively repair the damage caused to
the environment. Ecolo calls for the inclusion of ecological harm principle in the Code
civil20.

Proposal: To limit and strictly regulate the possession of firearms
Criminologists and associations agree that the number of firearms in circulation
in a society determines statistically the level of violence gunshot, a fortiori when those
weapons in the home. Current events shown too often when simple conflict
neighborhood, family disputes or situations of despair rock in the drama because of the
presence of a firearm. For several years, the Arms Act has been
many changes but remains unsatisfactory.
For Eco should be:
20

This principle is complementary to the polluter pays principle adopted by the OECD in 1972, as contained in the Single Act
EU signed in 1986. See chapter "Justice and Prisons" for more information.

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter SECURITY POLICE AND FIRE - p 10/24

implement a real policy to fight against weapons trafficking;
strictly limit the firing of weapons to people who can demonstrate a pattern
real legitimate (hunters, sport shooters, professionals). Once a legitimate reason disappeared,
the firearm must be recorded to an authority or disabled irreversibly;
reduce the administrative burden on gun ownership controls fire;
better regulate the advertising of arms sales fairs.

Proposal: Fight against cybercrime
In the age of new technologies, the fight against cybercriminalité21 (images and video networks
child pornography, phishing22 emails, etc.) must be the subject of a new attention
part of the police and judicial authorities.
It is appropriate for this purpose:
train and educate members of the parquet this type of crime the twenty-first century;
pay special attention to crimes cyberhate (Internet hate crime). A
circulaire23, adopted in 2013, makes reference. It is a slow start. Ecolo will require
assessment of its implementation and awareness of judges to the fight against
Cybercrime and cyberhate;
strengthen the Computer Crime Unit within the federal police. Cybercrime is a
particular form of criminality that requires training and specialization of
police officers;
improve information and awareness campaigns about the risks
identity theft as well as possible remedies.
For Ecolo, the fight against cyber crime must remain a competence of the federal police and
deserves strengthening human and financial resources at its disposal.

Proposal: Develop a comprehensive approach to drugs
In terms of toxicomanie24, Ecolo intends to limit and prevent maximum consumption
problem of psychotropic substances.
It is right to :
develop a comprehensive approach focusing primarily on protection of the objectives of
health, prevention, risk reduction and the fight against addictions;
strengthen law enforcement against trafficking, drug dealers, trafficking in human beings and
money laundering and to completely dismantle the networks of traffic
drugs, the Belgian, European and international level, as part of the fight against
organized crime. To this end, Ecolo calls for greater police cooperation in order
to fight against these large-scale trafficking.

PRIORITY 3: CHOOSING A REAL POLICE CLOSE AT THE HEART
COMPANY
The reform of the police (integrated police on two levels, local and federal) had, among others,
objective increased police presence on the streets, in direct service of the population,
including reducing administrative workload of officers and agents.
The assessment of 10 years of police reform has delivered a negative conclusion: it resulted in a
most expensive police, less well formed, with too much time remains occupied by
administrative work. The reform has dependent areas more and more missions very
heavy greatly reducing the means and the police general reserve workforce
(monitoring stations, highways police, mentoring and unforeseen events
events). The reduction of public budgets has weakened this fundamental mission of the State.
The general reserve is no longer able to meet the needs and come in support of the
police. Optimization of the next reform of the federal police can not undermine the
philosophy of community policing, through a new transfer missions to the police
local.
On the ground, chaos, lack of motivation and anger of police personnel are real.
At the same time, on the grounds of breaches fill a growing privatization of
develops security: security at public events, custodial staff, central
security conveyor funds, etc. Gold Ecolo, for ethics, ethics
and efficiency, the state should keep a monopoly on security missions of people and order
public.

Proposal: Establish a true community policing
Ecolo proposes to strengthen the implementation of community policing, oriented
community, incorporating the needs of the people and their feelings of insecurity, objectives and
subjective, and is active on the scale of quartiers25. With this in mind, proposes to multiply Ecolo
non-motorized patrolling (on foot, on horseback, by bike, on skates), to ensure a police presence
in villages and neighborhoods (including areas with specific problems:
commercial hub, generating places of nuisances such as dance halls ...) within wide ranges
schedules. Local Prevention Partnerships for Independents (PLP-I) in neighborhoods
Traders can also be developed where warranted. Finally, encourage Ecolo
organizing the participation of police officers in the life of the community (neighborhood festivals, tours
schools, "open house" operations ...).
In the same vein, though efforts have been made in recent years by the commitment
assistants and social workers, should further improve public reception in
police, especially vulnerable people or subjected to physical assault and / or
sexual, and especially through training, which should pay particular attention to
various family situations, the question of domestic and family violence, sexism,
racism, homophobia, etc. Furthermore, it is necessary to insert the fight against violence
marital and family in all zonal security plans.
Ecolo proposes to engage safely in the concept of "Community policing" 26, including
by favoring the establishment of cross-functional teams and déspécialisées, who make a real
working area (neighborhood mediation, the fight against noise at night, information on
25

Such a model has been established successfully in the Brussels North area (Evere / Schaerbeek / Saint-Josse) where
structures "Koban" are open in the commercial districts of small police stations whose name in Japan
similar tasks to a "community policing" omnipresent in the city.
26
Land policy oriented policing to the community that develops partnerships with the community
which opposes the technical answers, ultra-safe and as stigmatizing the use of Taser (stun gun)
installing "mosquitos" or the introduction of curfews.

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter SECURITY POLICE AND FIRE - p 12/24

Safety precautions when going on holiday, Bicycle engravings, motorcycles, trailers,
cars). It should however be aware that team members remain legally
required to report crimes of which they are aware. The teams of "Community
policing "can be part of a partnership approach with the various components of
society (communal or social services, families, associations, schools ...), since the
citizens and workers concerned are informed of the consequences of their collaboration and are
voluntary (or in very specific and restrictive cases obliged by a legal provision). The
action areas include conflict prevention, traffic information or
the establishment of a safety diagnosis (for example through the establishment of
exploratoires27 steps). Ecolo therefore proposes to provide a legal framework adapted to these partnerships
in "Community policing", including for the exchange of certain information in the

respect for the protection of privacy.
The reform for optimizing the organization of the federal police to worthy goal
improve and streamline the organization of the federal police, via decentralization to
judicial districts. This reform can not charge more local police missions
historically assigned to the federal police, risking to undermine community policing and
further adding to the bill for the municipalities. At present, the local police is already too
often diverted from its field work by tasks that normally fall under police
Federal (coaching demonstrations, monitoring stages, replacing guards
prisons on strike ...). Ecolo proposes to promote a reinforcement of the general reserve, in support
punctual service to nearby local police service of the people.
Finally, the local police is often taken up with administrative tasks, so that there
an expectation of the people for a police presence on the ground. To do this, argues Ecolo
to reduce administrative burdens and duties of police services. Simplification
judicial and administrative police procedures is a work to be taken urgently to arms
the body. This could be, for example, the integration between IT systems
Police and justice and thus limit the time lost a double encoding of files by
the police and prosecutors. Such integration could also IT services
readability statistics of police and prosecutors often different in some
areas. However, this integration should go hand in hand with guaranteed respect for the protection of
Data litigants: all non-anonymised data should not be shared or
flow between all services and authorities.

Proposal: For occasional use and Box surveillance cameras
For Ecolo, the installation of cameras must be provided only in a timely manner and well
framed. An evaluation of the use of cameras to be performed and the installation of new
surveillance cameras should be considered in specific frames the light of developments
technology (detection mechanisms activities, computer standby ...). Advances
Computer make indeed possible, so more and more effective, the detection
Automated movements and revealing situations of risk of accidents, crimes, which
then allows preventive interventions, law enforcement or victim assistance. Their use must
be framed: protection and data retention, differentiation public and private spaces,
protection of suspects and victims of crime, etc. In any
because, given the cost of surveillance cameras (human and material), Ecolo
emphasizes the presence in the field of police and district officers - more effective as
preventive measure - to the use of cameras.

27
March with citizens to travel a street or neighborhood, within a predefined space are the
different problems and so collectively they provide solutions.

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter SECURITY POLICE AND FIRE - p 13/24

Proposal: Recruit and complete police executives
The police reform was based on the "standard KUL" 28 to fix theoretical frameworks
font services. But this theoretical framework is based on parameters of 1998 and have
not been updated since. Furthermore, KUL standard had not integrated certain criteria such as
overtime or type of crime, it is insufficient. The framework is not
not always filled, among others in large cities. Furthermore, the specificities of some
urban areas have apparently not been taken into account; this is the case for common
Border conducting joint actions with the police of other countries or municipalities
hosting large numbers of commuters or students, which generates fees
Additional to the municipalities.
It is therefore necessary that the federal funding for this police reform is corrected based
new objective criteria. Ecolo proposes to engage in the review of the KUL standard,
consultation with the police, based on new objectives and specific criteria
corresponding to the realities and specificities of urban, rural and cross-border.
Furthermore, some areas have a framework of full complement police. Areas face
different problems depending on their specificity: rural town, border town,
big city. Although the situation of a lack of staff is problematic in all major
cities, police zones and Brussels Hainaut are understaffed shouting about 500
Police lack of a frame of a little over 5600 agents in Brussels (nearly 8%) and
about 700 police officers are missing a part of a little over 4200 agents in Hainaut (either
nearly 15%). A recruitment effort is therefore particularly necessary. 400 agents
additional police have been announced for the Brussels area, Ecolo will follow up this
commitment. The recruitment effort must be accompanied by complementary measures,
regarding information and promotion of police work in Brussels, softening
language requirements and financial support to their sustainable institution in Brussels.
Ecolo also encourages the initiative of some police districts to hire civilians (or CaLog29)
to fulfill the administrative tasks or receipt. In addition, the terms of engagement
CALOG within areas should be relaxed, particularly to allow recruitment
of persons in employment included under "Article 60".

Proposal: Strengthen staff in Brussels
Brussels police recruitment
Alongside a reinforcement in the recruitment of police officers, it is important to ensure strengthened
police workforce to ensure a good understanding of ground realities and
the population of the police zone.
The situation in the Brussels area deserves special attention. Indeed, only 7.45% of
Police are of the Brussels Region of Brussels. This situation is mainly due to
language requirements and that training too few candidates meet in Brussels,
but it is not without consequences for knowledge and contact with the field, as well as
excessive mobility of the workforce. It is necessary that the number of areas in Brussels
Police in the capital increases. Indeed, agents from different areas of Brussels
have a special relationship with the people, improving the contact, policing and
reducing the feeling of insecurity.
For Ecolo, the Brussels government needs to develop its own policies
Brussels police officers recruitment and training of its staff continued. Ecolo offers

amount of subsidies paid by the federal House of Commons to participate in the financing of the police zones.

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter SECURITY POLICE AND FIRE - p 14/24

also that every police follows a continuing training in the police academy attached to his
police zone to ensure their awareness of safety issues specific to their area.

Proposal: To ensure the recruitment of women and diversity in services
from police
While it is important that the number of police correspond to field realities
area, it is also essential that women in particular and population diversity
General are properly represented within the country's police. Ecolo offers
develop information and awareness campaigns to public
specific, such as women and people of foreign origin, which are currently under-represented within the police.

Proposal: To fight against police violence and against police
The news regularly highlights acts of police violence. The police must be the guarantor
public order and must inspire confidence in the population. Moreover, the police are
regularly face violence in family and social drama, stress,
a priori negative related to their function. An organized psychological support may prove useful in
certain situations, as well as upgrading the image of the police. In addition, training and
selection of police officers must be improved to enable them to deal with situations
stress and violence, conflict management, to be sensitized to sexism, racism and
homophobia, relieve stress related to their function.
Ecolo proposes to evaluate and modernize the operation of Committee P, to specify and clarify its
tasks and role to ensure the independence of its investigations and to strengthen its control
democratic and political. For Ecolo, the complaints procedure for victims of police violence
should be improved to provide a clear answer, fast and motivated. Committee P must
take charge of internal investigations, when there is a complaint policière30 violence. For
Ecolo, the P Committee must also carry out audits of areas when multiple complaints
directed against police officers in the area.
Ecolo also proposes to allow all political groups recognized in the federal parliament
to be part of the Monitoring Committee of Committee P, in compliance with the rules of confidentiality and
behind closed doors.
Finally, Ecolo supports proposals to improve the identification of policemen in full
circonstance31. When the nameplate can become a hindrance to the performance of his duties
or his own safety, the officer must be able to replace a number but identification32
this should remain the exception: completely erase the name of the police officer's uniform risk reality
to reach a totally opposite effect with dehumanisation and disempowerment, which is
contradicts the principle of community policing.

30

Refer the charge of the investigation to the police the same areas as their colleagues in question does not meet the
intention of the legislature that created the Committee P. These police are not independent enough of their colleagues who live
difficult situations. Today saw the attitude of Committee P, the only solution for a complaint to succeed is to wear
civil complaint. But that lengthens and increases the procedure.
31
Currently, any police intervention must identify himself by means of his identity card and an armband (worn by
at least one of plainclothes police intervention) or a nameplate (whose port is compulsory
uniform). There are some exceptions, such as, for example, special teams or in the general reserve
maintaining public order intervention (eg event).
32
For example, during the demonstrations, largest register in the back of police officers in uniform, their number
identification, as is the case in Berlin and London.

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter SECURITY POLICE AND FIRE - p 15/24

Proposal: Involve federal entities to develop priorities
criminelle33 the policy and integrated security
The Federal Government establishes every five years a national security plan establishing the
police34 priorities. The priority determines the type of response that the authority gives
various forms of crime. The floors are, in turn, to determine the competent
research policy and prosecution in their arrondissement35. The Minister and the College of
Prosecutors General always able to issue binding guidelines.
Following the sixth state reform, the federated entities will be involved, via an agreement
cooperation in the development of voluntary guidelines, coordinated at the federal level.
Ecolo for federal coordination and the cooperation agreement will in any event
preserve the independence of judges and a federal Justice.
Alongside the national security plan, Ecolo supports the development of a "security framework notes
integrated ". Such notes would move towards greater coherence in the policy
Security, particularly through its enlargement to other areas and actors outside areas
"Traditional" police and justice. Through this, one tends towards a more secure society
ensures a balance between, on the one hand, freedoms and chances of development of each
citizen and citizen and on the other hand, optimum protection of the integrity of these citizens and
citizens and society.
Ecolo wants to finally provide a binding legal basis for this "security framework notes
integrated ", establishing the vision and priority missions of the federal government and in which
should fit the national security plan. The federated entities should be involved in the
limits of their powers, in the drafting of such a framework note. Ecolo wishes therefore that the
"Rating integrated security framework" is quickly established by the next government to
allow the preparation of future national security plan and other documents proving the
Security priorities.

Proposal: democratically Set police priorities
Locally, for the police to be the guardian of democracy and democratic itself, it
is essential to define the priorities of police duties in a democratic way
Police zonal councils and ensure the transparency of their activities.
Ecolo offers:
encourage police boards to create meeting spaces with citizens,
associations, representatives and representatives of the police and the local council for
be attentive to what is happening in the municipality (road safety, mobility, conflicts,
Crime, land use ...), for "charting of insecurity"
develop proposals and inform the public;
to review the tasks and the role of the police board to make the police board the place
discussion of security and local police policy;
to publicize the Police Board;
clarify the mission and role of the police board in relation to the municipal council.
In pluricommunales areas, the police board must exercise political function, which
seeks consistency between the municipalities in the same area and which goes beyond the
organization thereof. Ecolo also calls for harmonization of the value of
attendance fees between the local council and the police board;
33
Criminal policy is the set of measures, criminal or not, help to ensure the protection of society
against crime, to arrange the fate of offenders and ensure the rights of victims.

to generalize the citizens' right to apprehend in police advice, like this
that is done in the municipal councils;
systematize internal order regulations, defining the modalities of questioning,
information, communication ... of every police board;
to regularly assess the police and security policies implemented in the field,
to allow continuous adjustment of decisions based on objectives
pursued and observed effects. The municipal authorities must also ensure
communication and publicity of these assessments.

Proposal: Ensure a coordinated regional policy in Brussels
The sixth state reform has provided the Brussels-Capital Region new skills
security and police organization. Thus, the Minister-President will be responsible for
maintenance of public order within the Region and coordinate security policies
Brussels, on the basis, inter alia, the new regional comprehensive plan for security. Ecolo calls for
the new global safety plan includes a better link between priorities
safety and that of Justice.
For an effective and coordinated policy on the territory of Brussels, through the communal level
the six zones and the regional level, Ecolo calls for the coordination of policing priorities of the six
areas at the regional level for the pooling of administrative services and the use of
central purchasing for the acquisition of equipment by the six areas. The coordination of services
Police and security policies must meet the specificities related to the status of multi-Capital
of the Region.
As part of the security coordination missions under the authority of the Minister-President,
must also entrust to these police services shared and shared interest Assignments
regional. It may be, for example, the safety of major stations, management of events
unforeseen or missions under the Statute of multi-Capital Region, such as
security of international institutions and their tops or supervision of major
sporting events and demonstrations. During these missions, these "regional" service
Police officers will consist of general reserve - which should be strengthened for this purpose and staff seconded from zones36.

Proposal: Establish clear rules of conduct applicable to
All security actors
Police control must focus on efficiency, ethics and policy options
of security. In this context, it is important to allow any agent who notices any abuse
power, acts of discrimination or racism as part of his work to denounce
facts from a person of trust.
Ecolo is also opposed to the privatization of security and the proliferation of surveillance by
prevention and security guards, private security, private investigators, etc. without code
ethics without control of their actions and without setting clear tasks and above
demarcated.
Ecolo otherwise objects to a transfer of new public tasks of the police to
security guards and private security. For Ecolo, the proliferation of new guards
public order carrying more and more police missions strengthens a font image
repressive, distant people. Ecolo reaffirms its choices for public policy, effective and
guarantor of public order.

36

The detachment of these zones agents will not reduce the effective part of the zones.

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter SECURITY POLICE AND FIRE - p 17/24

Ecolo proposes to set the status and complete the formation of urban stewards, officers
Prevention and Safety (APS), park wardens and guards, etc., "gentle authority figures"
as defined in the King Baudouin Foundation. They bring a presence on the street, recreate the link
Social in neighborhoods, promote the reintegration of job seekers and fulfill
tasks that should no longer be encountered by the field police. It is important nonetheless
clarify the roles and missions of each and everyone, which are complementary, because a
peacekeeper should not the job of a police officer, and vice versa.

PRIORITY 4: THE SUCCESSFUL REFORM OF CIVIL SECURITY, PROTECTION
ANY AND ALL
Ghislenghien disaster, Liège, Wetteren or Godinne emphasize the importance of investing
in fire and rescue services. They have shown, often tragically, the
need for a thorough reform of these services to ensure the safety of citizens,
only shortcuts and standardized response times.
The reform of the Civil Security was passed in 2007, but it has still not been set
implemented in full. The mayors are ready to define the best conditions for
out but never received the necessary budgetary resources to do this. To date, in
some areas, the numbers vary widely between fire services: the minimum figure
Legal firefighters is not always achieved and some services have no firefighter
professionnel37. Volunteer status is determined by the mayors and varies up
in wages.
In Brussels, the SIAMU must be recognized as an emergency zone. The central role of the capital
Country and its fire department should also be recognized.

Proposal: Increase federal funding and ensure civil security
Since 2007, successive financial years have not generated sufficient means for
implementation of the reform of the Security civile38. The minimalist government commitment
Federal does not allow municipalities to finance this reform alone. All pay also
Already the price of the reform of police forces and therefore can not support the reform without
fiscal insurance.
For Ecolo, federal funding of the reform of the fire service remains a priority. There
budget neutrality of the reform for municipalities must be guaranteed. Annual funding
fire departments, out of government, must tend towards a 50/50 split between
the federal state and local authorities. In a restricted budgetary context, proposes that Ecolo
Some of this funding is guaranteed by an insurance sector contribution no impact
on consumers. Ecolo also supports enhanced synergies between
civil protection and civil security. It should explore the possibility of merging the two
services, as proposed by some players.
As for the fire service Bruxelles39 (SIAMU), calls for Ecolo
SIAMU recognition as a specific relief area. Such recognition
be accompanied by an equivalent financial mechanism to the federal staffing establishment for
all relief areas, taking into account the important role played by such SIAMU

37

A unique project status for volunteer firefighters is pending. The negotiations have failed to reach an
agreement at the time of publication of our program.
38
The 2014 budget provides for an annual budget of € 52 million to the emergency services, while field players
calling between 70 and 200 million.
39
The SIAMU covers the territory of the Brussels-Capital Region, or the 19 municipalities of Brussels. The SIAMU is
now the country's largest fire service and is the only one not to be considered an emergency area.

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter SECURITY POLICE AND FIRE - p 18/24

Fire Service of the Belgian and European capital. For Ecolo, the federal government must also
fund safety Bruxelloises and Brussels, without touching the funding provided to
other rescue areas. The overall federal allocation should be increased by a staffing
Federal scheduled for SIAMU.
Generally, interventions SIAMU outside the region (near 10% of its
interventions) or those performed by an area in another zone, may be charged to
common areas or that benefit.

Proposal: Improve the quality of emergency services
Five years after the adoption of the reform of fire, efforts must still be made
to improve the quality of services and ensure the safety of citizens, citizens and
firefighters. Today, the emergency services have too often from intervention with
Incomplete team due to staff shortages. While waiting for reinforcements, these firefighters
can fulfill their mission properly and put in greater danger. In this context,
Ecolo calls for a strengthening of the intervention of emergency services teams. Otherwise,
for Ecolo, we must ensure effective adequate staff to fulfill the mission ambulance
firefighters as well as 112 stations.
Improving the quality of services also requires:
or improving the organization of practical training to the attention of the fire brigade
(basic and continuing training, with credit hours);
reform schools Fire and standardization of training programs provided
by fire schools;
improving the organization of feedback to
recommendations based on the analysis of the actions on the ground;

to

formulate

of

organizing psychological support and a specific accompaniment
end of career ;
the presence of at least 20% of professional firefighters, the police chief in
each zone;
updating standards of the Royal Decree of 1967, in order to take into account changes
industrial risks, natural, military and domestic;
the creation of an area prevention office and building trainings
fire prevention, such as the license notice of surrender for building industries;
to reducing the backlog in preventive visits;
strengthening training for interventions on Seveso sites, site
nuclear or solar panels;
regular renewal of equipment, which today is sometimes inadequate and antiquated,
and synergies with civil protection in the use of the equipment.
Finally, the quality of fire services also involves improving the status of firefighters
professionals, consolidation and improvement of the specific status of volunteers and firefighters
a wage scale revaluation - financially supported by the federal - of all firefighters.

Proposal: Overcoming local resistance to
more effective intervention
For Ecolo, the objective of security and an equal protection for all within 12 minutes
everywhere, is feasible, provided that it agrees to transfer the common responsibilities

Ecolo program 2014 - Justice and Security Book - Chapter SECURITY POLICE AND FIRE - p 19/24

to the emergency areas, which will not prevent federal involvement. Relief areas
must be installed and zone commanders must be appointed quickly.
Unfortunately, some local resistance persist in the implementation of the reform,
face the loss of responsibility and decision-making power. These resistors are not yet
undermine the need for quality service to the population, nor the definition of areas according to
objective criteria. Moreover, for Ecolo, the common area of ​​the same term should be on
equally in the decision process: a common one vote. Ecolo offers
also pooling investments in the emergency area.

Proposal: Give priority to strengthening
industrial and nuclear safety
Many accidents could certainly have been avoided or its consequences dwindled by
more systematic policy of prevention of industrial risks in general, by better
coordination of emergency plans and a better knowledge of all types of pipes
that abound in basements or dangerous journeys by public transport. In addition,
installing more solar panels on industrial and private sites
increases the risk of electric shock of fire services in their interventions.
Priority should be given to the prevention of industrial and nuclear risks, by drawing
a register of basements and solar panels, by holding regular exercises
'catastrophe', for closer contact between businesses and emergency services by an
Special training for fire services, adapted equipment, by better
population information, for optimal coordination of the institutions and authorities in the
part of contingency planning (particularly in border areas) and with attention
special nuclear risk Seveso and the safety of dangerous transport.

PRIORITY 5: BRING THE TERRORIST THREAT AND AN ANSWER LUCID
RESPECTFUL OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS
Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, a battery of international regulations and
National has emerged. Like the United States or other countries of the European Union, Belgium
has adopted in recent years laws to fight against terrorism and crime
organized.
For Ecolo, if public authorities must be able to protect the population of all
forms of violence, the fight against terrorism and crime can not, however, jeopardize the
fundamental rights such as respect for privacy, freedom of expression and association. Gold

rights.



The new law adopted in 2013, which adds the notion of direct and indirect incitement to commit
a terrorist offense adds an extra dose of inaccuracies. For Ecolo, the role of
Federal prosecution must be reviewed and subject to democratic control that respects its
independence, for example by involving the prosecution of Prosecutor or the Attorney General's Office
normally competent. Finally, Ecolo calls for an overall assessment of the statutes of 2003 and
2013.

Proposal: Tagging specific research methods and
the use of personal data
As part of the fight against terrorism, the Law on Special Research Methods
(MPR) of the police services and the law on Data Collection Methods (MRD) by
intelligence and security services (the State Security Service and the General
Intelligence and Military Security) enable to submit those suspected
of belonging to a terrorist organization with intrusive surveillance methods, undermining
respect for privacy: wiretapping, "discreet" surveillance, direct monitoring, interception
and opening e-mails ...
If one can not dispute the police and intelligence and security services need to
have certain means to carry out their missions, Ecolo calls better
safeguards are provided to prevent any infringement of fundamental rights and freedoms.
Belgium has transposed the European directive on data retention. Henceforth,
Internet and telephone service providers must keep "traffic data" of
their customers for a year. The goal is to keep all this data available in case of inquiry
on organized crime, or terrorism. The case of hacking Belgacom has demonstrated the extreme
vulnerability of these databases.
That is why, besides the evaluation of this law, Ecolo has decreased
duration of data retention at 6 months, and a strict limitation of the number of persons
authorities which may have access.

Proposal: Strengthen the powers of supervisory bodies
Besides the tags and safeguards the methods used by the police and service
intelligence and security to prevent any infringement of fundamental rights and freedoms,
Ecolo believes it should also strengthen their control.

The R Committee is responsible for control of intelligence and security services. To strengthen
democratic control over these services, like the proposal with regard to the P Committee (see
above), Ecolo proposes to allow all political groups recognized in Federal Parliament
be part of the Monitoring Committee of the R Committee, respecting the rules of confidentiality and closed
closed.
Furthermore, Ecolo proposes to strengthen the role and powers of the Commission for Protection
privacy. This is to strengthen its independence from political and service
intelligence and security. Moreover, Ecolo offers to grant him a coercive power to
enforce the laws on protection of privacy for everyone, in
including the authorities.

International relationships
EUROPE
A federal, democratic and solidarity
Status and political horizon
State of play
The European Union project was built on tremendous solidarity hopes of unification
political and economic. The Union has contributed to peace and stability of an entire continent, and has
gradually open to new States.
But the European project passes through the most turbulent in recent years. Aspects
democracy and subsidiarity have been largely neglected, as it was considered
for two decades, the face of globalization, deregulation was the main option,
the financial economy and short-term profit taking precedence over the real economy. The
confrontations and competition between sovereign states resumed vigor in all
areas, starting with the economy.
Interest and national timetables unique compasses become a Union that no longer believes
too into it, and barely more to convince its citizens. The economic and financial crisis
completion of draining European parliamentary democracy and allowed the passage in force
also remedies unfair totally ineffective, exacerbating the situation a little more and contributing
the emergence of new dividing lines between the center and the periphery of the European Union. They
whether or not directly affected, this generates among the European citizens
disapproval and discontent; the growing Euroscepticism does indeed transpires that
too clearly in the Eurobarometer and the election results.
Thus, Europeans are feeling the exhaustion of this society and its model and deadlock
in which he leads.
The European institutions and the political momentum resulting from the Lisbon Treaty do not
derived the maximum benefit to animate and transform the European project.

The European horizon Ecolo
Faced with this rather gloomy picture of a European Union in need of legitimacy, it is urgent to
(re) build a European project based on social justice, environmental justice and interest
ordinary Europeans. Beyond its borders, Europe must spearhead a
global governance and international cooperation, assuming its responsibilities in the
deteriorating economic, social and environmental conditions of developing countries.
This requires revisiting the mode of operation of Europe and its institutions as well
the relationship between levels of government, with adequate policy levers to influence the
decisions, starting with budgetary decisions.
The European Union is not a single economic space, a large boat now
subject to the operation of a remote technocracy, sometimes under the supervision of either
Head of State seeking to impose its model and its priorities. It can no longer be what it is
become: a fragmented area of ​​economic and tax competition between states reluctant to
solidarity, unable to define their common fairer trade relations with

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter EUROPE - p 1/26

rest of the world and competing for investors, advantages and exceptions all
kinds. It can not, as a fortress to lock from the inside, to specialize
only in humanitarian and shine by its absence in the major policy issues
foreign. Faced with the global crises of the twenty-first century and against international finance, wants Ecolo
be an international citizen, a reconstruction by the European people. It's a
dual speed race that is engaged face these imbalances and rising nationalpopulisme.
This chapter of the 2014 program addresses European issues only from the angle
institutional. Aspects related to the content of sectoral policies are discussed in the
Specific chapters. They are mentioned here only to recall. Nevertheless, certain proposals
Chapter address the substantive policy areas, when it comes to materials
exclusively European (MFF trade policy reforms
institutional and democratic) or when separated from the substantive proposals,
as some elements of European governance (economic governance and the area
euro, environmental and climate governance, defense and foreign policy of the Union,
representation in international institutions).

The Ecolo force lines
Strengthening European Democracy: legitimacy, transparency, participation and monitoring
democratic ;
Putting economic governance in the real economy and the transition
ecological ;
Re-legitimize the multiannual budget and chart the course of a European federal budget;
Adopting a new European social pact;
Respect the social and environmental clauses throughout Europe and the world;
Ensuring a voice to the European Union on the international stage.

Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: STRENGTHENING EUROPEAN DEMOCRACY LEGITIMACY,
TRANSPARENCY, MONITORING AND DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION
For a political union
Proposal: Create a European constituency
The maintenance of constituencies at the national level does not allow the existence of a debate
Democratic at the supranational level, nor the emergence of a European political class. Of
national or regional issues are too often obscure European issues, which
contributes to disconnect citizens from decision-making at EU level. To accentuate the
legitimacy of the European Parliament and to facilitate the emergence of debates on issues truly
Europe during election campaigns, Ecolo advocates the establishment, alongside other
national constituencies, of a European electoral constituency for some of
the hemicycle.

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter EUROPE - p 2/26

Proposal: Rethinking appointment methods, composition and control
European Commission
Ecolo supports the announcement by each group of the European Parliament of the name of a candidate
President of the European Commission, within it, before the European elections and the
Election Day, voters can, on a separate ballot, mark their preference among
candidates nominated by the European parties for the post of president. Moreover, for
the appointment of European Commissioners, Ecolo advocates the establishment of a new
procedure by which Member States via their respective national parliaments, would be
called to propose a list of two candidates, a man and a woman to the post of member
the Commission. This procedure is expected to strengthen the democratic nature of
designation process and increase the proportion of women within the Commission. There
list should be composed of persons whose integrity and competence are indisputable and
are motivated by a desire to invest in the European project.
The Treaty entrusts the President-elect of the Commission to decide on the internal organization of
the latter, in particular as regards the definition and assignment of the various
portfolios. In this regard, particular attention should be paid to the skills and
affinities of the various candidates. Furthermore, Ecolo is specifically proposes that a Commissioner
responsible for consumer protection and other restructuring (which is an area
somehow "dormant" since it is the political crossovers
employment, industry, competition and the internal market) and control (the size) of
multinationales1 companies. While, today, Parliament can only approve or reject the
Bulk Commission, a reform of the Treaties should make it possible to individually remove a
candidate Commissioner.

Proposal: Evolving to a smaller Commission
Since the creation of the European Commission wanted to practice that each Member State there
as Commissioner sends one of its nationals. This goes against the spirit of the Treaty that
the EU executive wants to be independent countries. If this could be some logic there
20 years ago when the EU had a reduced number of Member States, this logic has
disappeared progressively enlargements. Thus, today, some Commissioners are
responsible for a laughable portfolio.
Ecolo therefore intends to reduce the number of Commissioners, even if they are backed by
Deputy Commissioners and Assistant Commissioners when their competence is vast, everything
ensuring that these positions are not exclusively reserved for representatives of countries
most populous countries or founders. Such reform should lead to greater coherence
and efficiency.

For a Democratic Union and responsible policies
Proposal: Strengthen the role of parliamentary assemblies and control
democratic
The Belgian governments are led, according to the federal, community
and regional, to legislate as members of the Council of Ministers, co-legislator of the Union
European. The Belgian rules on the matter provide that the positions defended by Ministers
Belgian coordinated by the Directorate General of the European FPS Foreign Affairs. The positions
and are adopted by consensus on the basis of notes prepared by the firms, administration and
the Permanent Representation of Belgium to the EU.

1

See in this respect Chapter "ecological transition".

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter EUROPE - p 3/26

The federal parliament, let alone other meetings, are informed as fairly
plot positions negotiated by Governments. Moreover, many positions
defended by Belgium to the Council hardly the subject of interest and review
parliamentary. For example, only 2% of questions relating to the Government
EU activities while 50% of legislation passed by national parliaments
come from decisions taken at European level.
Therefore intends Ecolo systematise the democratic control of the Executive in the Council
and strengthen the analytical and evaluation capacities including the assemblies feature.
To do this, it should:
reinvigorate the responsible committees of the European view of the different Questions
parliaments;
devote one day a month to questions and interpellations on issues related to
the European Union in the parliaments of federated entities and the federal Parliament;
develop links and exchanges between national parliaments within the
procedure laid down in the Treaty, which gives them a say early on
legislative proposals of the European Commission and which may lead to revise or
abandon these proposals;
encourage the various parliaments to make better use of the alert mechanism
précoce2;
ensure that federal and regional ministers who represent Belgium in the Council
Ministers routinely pass before the competent committee of Parliament
federal (regional parliament which will be involved if any) and the
exchanges allow to identify priority issues for parliamentarians that
Ministers defend in question; After the Council meeting, Ministers will report
to the parliamentary committee;
ensure, in the federal Parliament, a debate on national programs
reform and stability programs before sending them to the European Commission for
the end of April each year;
review internal rules (development of the Belgian position) and the length of rotations
regional ministers at the EU Council to allow clear Belgian position, putting
negotiating position, and a real investment of Ministers in the dynamics of the
Advice ;
developing parliamentarism by associating upstream decisions and with true
ability to influence decisions, national parliaments and / or regional in
European Parliament.

Proposal: Auditioning officials of the European Commission
load followed by Belgium
In this spirit, the systematic application Ecolo hearing in Federal Parliament officials
the European Commission in charge of drafting proposals for recommendations
addressed to our country. This hearing should take place in the presence of Ministers of Employment and
Economics, before they do go expose the position of Belgium to other members of
Advice.

2

The early warning mechanism was introduced in the Lisbon Treaty to allow national parliaments to draw
the attention of the Commission which emanate various legislative proposals on a major issue (order
Constitutional example); if a number, they may lead the Commission to revise its proposal.

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter EUROPE - p 4/26

Proposal: To ensure the multidisciplinary of Officials
recommendations to Member States
Ecolo supports the idea that officials in charge of developing recommendations
European addressed to the Member States must first have served in two
other Directorates-General (DG). This proposal has the effect of ensuring that these officials
have enough experience. They pass through different DGs is supposed to have provided their
the opportunity to acquire and expand their knowledge and enable them to incorporate some
multidisciplinary approach in the development of recommendations that, so far, are often hit the
Seal of dogmatism.

Proposal: Avoid conflicts of interests of Commissioners and
Parliamentarians
Ecolo intends to ensure that former European commissioners, who have been under the lights
ramp and the top of the decision-making hierarchy, ensured their duties impartially and
in good faith, that their retraining prospects did not interfere with their decisions
when sitting on the Commission and do not take undue advantage of their notebooks
address and influence for the purpose of personal enrichment.
Therefore Ecolo proposes that until three years after they leave the EU executive, the
former Commissioners present each year, before the competent committee of Parliament
European, the content of their activities have been a source of conflict of interest during the month
passed. If MEPs had to conclude that these ethical rules were not met,

those involved would lose the social rights related to the occupation of the post of Commissioner.
Additionally, it is to adopt a regulation to exclude old
Commissioners decision making bodies of companies and to exclude these companies from the
participation in European programs and / or withdraw the benefit of European funds.
The Commission based online should disseminate information regarding the meetings between
Commissioners or their official representatives and lobbyists.
Beyond the existing obligation for MEPs to return a statement
interests and mandates and to observe the code of conduct regarding gifts, trips
and invitations by third parties, Ecolo supports what the EP rapporteurs publish in their
report a "legislative footprint" ("legislative footprint") indicating the lobbyists encountered.
Ecolo also asks that they can encounter in the precinct as those
registered in the Transparency Register.

Proposal: Strengthen the rules, ethics and transparency of lobbies and
their activity
The current transparency register must become mandatory for the various categories of
lobbyists. It must become more accurate in the information contained on the sources of
funding organizations registered therein, to constituents to law firms and
amounts and staff resources devoted to lobbying.

Proposal: To ensure respect for fundamental values ​​in the States
Member
The Treaty establishes a procedure which may lead to the adoption of sanctions against a state
member that violates the fundamental values ​​of the Union. However, it has never been activated
to this day, despite some serious violations of fundamental values ​​and characterized,
as was the case in Hungary recently. The arrival of an openly neo-Nazi party

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter EUROPE - p 5/26

the Greek Parliament and the favorable polls to the extreme right in France must prompt us to
greater vigilance. Therefore Ecolo and will urge the European Greens
Belgian Government and the European authorities on the need to initiate this procedure if
future events require.

For a citizen and participatory Union
Proposal: Develop direct participation tools
The Lisbon Treaty has revolutionized direct participation in establishing the Citizens' Initiative
European. It enables one million citizens from at least seven Member States
to propose to the Commission a draft regulation or directive. He then returns to the
Commission to justify what it intends to do with that text.
The first initiatives have demonstrated that direct democracy is possible and desirable. In
Indeed, initiatives were filed to recognize water and sanitation as
human rights. Given the quality of work that has been provided, the Commission has anticipated and modified
itself its legislative proposal. Ecolo urges the Commission to continue its momentum
and explores any action modalities of support from civil society and to mobilize
around a citizens' initiative.
But citizen initiatives are not to be the only direct democracy instruments
involve citizens in the European decision-making and, a fortiori, in the process
EU integration.
As such, Ecolo offers:
Systematizing the Agoras of the European Parliament, in the form of citizen panels
deliberative.
For example, as was the case in 2011 in the year of fight against poverty,
in November 2013, the Parliament, with the support of the Group of European Greens, welcomed
two days two youth from each EU country to discuss challenges
facing the European labor market. These participants were invited to
share experiences, exchange ideas and submit to the responsible
European policy recommendations to fight against youth unemployment.
These consensus conferences are necessary instruments to make citizens
the place they deserve in the European machine;
Create a "wiki-European citizenship" as a way to tame, to appropriate and
to build a European public space. More specifically, it would be a new site
internet, a wiki web, cooperative space of information and debates in the hands of
citizens. Parliament could support the initiative, but not the content via
carriers, including for translation. In the future, Wikis could be a
way to monitor policies and evaluate them. In addition, this tool would allow
European agents to stay connected to the reality of the citizens.
Encourage all the devices in terms of transnational mobilization (citizen
and civil society organizations), among others via social networks to influence the
decisions within the European institutions.
To organize popular consultations at European level, in all
Member States, on the same date, at the initiative of the Union, either by initiative
popular.

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter EUROPE - p 6/26

Proposal: Develop political and social dimensions of citizenship
European
The introduction of European citizenship in the Maastricht Treaty with the Europeans
Belgian resident of a series of political rights, foremost among them the right to vote and
stand in local elections. This European citizenship, moreover, possible to extend
access to certain rights of social protection (in social integration income, for example) to all
European citizens residing in Belgium when they were prior to that reserved exclusively
European workers residing in our territory. This construction is fragile, as
evidenced by the many withdrawals as stays of EU citizens accused of posing
an unreasonable burden on the Belgian welfare system. Alongside these political,
Ecolo encourages the deepening of the social dimensions of citizenship, insofar
they embody the values ​​of community and solidarity that underpin environmental project vision
European.

Proposal: Bring together a public agreement to the change
Treaties
The advances of the Lisbon Treaty can mostly be attributed to the work of the
European Convention, which laid the foundation. The convening of a convention,
brings together members of national parliaments and the European Parliament, representatives
governments and the European Commission is now an established procedure for
a Treaty change.
It should not be forgotten that the first European Convention began its work
in 2003 with the ambition to open to the general public and civil society. She has
unfortunately been undermined by the lack of public debate and involvement of populations before
and during his work as well as by the Intergovernmental Conference that followed and reduced to
nothingness some innovations decided by the Convention.
European environmentalists undertake to involve citizens and civil society in the next
Phase EU reforms which looks imminent and promote a timely
real debate at European level.
It should also forge the alliances necessary to change the system of revision
Treaties by submitting the reforms to the verdict of a European referendum, removing the right
veto granted to individual states and extending the rights of ratification to Parliament
European.

Proposal: To continue a friendly anchor of European institutions in
Brussels Metro
Many European citizens legitimately aspire to discover the places to take
important decisions that govern their lives everyday. Ecolo proposed that all
European institutions now open their spaces to citizens under conditions
Safety measured at fair measure. The Parlamentarium and the future House of History
Europe are the drafts of historical and democratic tours.

Proposal: Involve the EU to finance its capital
In a fair and responsible concern Ecolo proposes that the EU is directly involved in
financing its capital, Brussels, to the extent that the European institutions and their
Staff enjoy a series of benefits in terms of taxation or enjoyment of property

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter EUROPE - p 7/26

collective (infrastructure such as schools, roads, public transport, spaces
public, etc.), without contributing to the same manner as Brussels.

Proposal: Strengthen information and consultation at extensions
Real European institutions
Formal consultations with local and regional bodies at property extensions
should not obscure the need for information / consultation with all stakeholders
Local: neighborhood associations, residents committees, traders, televisions and media
regional, etc.
For Ecolo, must continue opening up the physical but also cultural institutions
European, supporting all activities enabling the encounter between the inhabitants of
Brussels and the European institutions and those who work there, in all their diversity,
within and beyond the European quarter.

For seamless EU
Proposal: To make the register mandatory transparency and
more effective
In June 2011, the European Commission and the European Parliament jointly launched the register
transparency in order to have a clearer picture of the activities of lobbyists in Brussels. The citizens
are indeed entitled to expect that the process of consultation with civil society
place in transparency and respect for the law and ethics, avoiding pressures
excessive and illegitimate or privileged access to information or policy makers.
The Green Group in the European Parliament was actively involved in the development and implementation
political establishment of this register.
For Ecolo, it is imperative to continue to improve the registry to make it compulsory,
give concrete follow the work of the group in 2013 to oversee its revision.

Proposal: Actively support the monitoring democracy
While maintaining strict independence, associations such as, among others, Vote Watch,
Alter EU, Transparency International, must be supported in their observation mission and
highlighted targeted information towards citizens and the media.

Proposal: Audit the future staff recruitment procedure
European
EPSO is the European Union that Selor is the federal Belgium: the body
which organizes recruitment tests and selects candidates for a government job
European.
The first wave of tests consists of several tests, one of them consists of
open questions whose evaluation requires a certain amount of subjectivity on the part of
examiners. Candidates pass to the next round if they achieve good performance
in each of these tests. Therefore, if the open answers of the candidates are not considered
conform to the model as currently expected by the EU institutions, candidates
fail selection. For Ecolo, this means that, from the outset, the recruitment process
may lead to a creaming and the single thought of European institutions. Thus, if in

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter EUROPE - p 8/26

Belgium one of the questions at the heart of the public service is that of depoliticization, in
European level, the challenge is to "dédogmatiser" institutions.
Ecolo proposes an audit of EPSO to objectify the situation and to consider solutions
to remove the blinders of European institutions.

For a united and effective European Union
Proposal: To enable Member States to move towards a federal destiny
European treaties provide, since 1996, the possibility for Member States that
wish to advance further on the road to integration and that even as other states
express misgivings. This is the renforcée3 cooperation mechanism.
This is therefore an interesting mechanism but must be framed so as not to weaken the fate
European common and open the way to a Europe à la carte, which would create new fractures
European Union already under strain.
Therefore Ecolo offers:
Establish institutional arrangements to avoid blocking the Member States
who wish to pursue the goal of integration and a federal grant them
Discussion own mechanisms and bodies;
Ensure that in no way states wishing to join enhanced cooperation
no current are prevented from doing so;
Making the European institutions to ensure that enhanced cooperation
do not affect the rights, obligations and interests of Member States which do not participate,
in the name of European solidarity.

Proposal: To promote the Community method for the common good
more than the sum of interest nationaux4
It is important in these times of political crisis, the European acquis and the spirit of the Fathers
founders are not unraveled in favor of purely national interests. It is simple
to observe how the implementation of European economic governance has made
against traditional government methods (either the Community method) for
promote the dictates of a few and not the European interest.
Therefore Ecolo request including the mechanisms of economic governance
leave the Intergovernmental way to find the virtuous path of common interest and
community spirit. Furthermore, such a shift towards an intergovernmental
Community would revive a real parliamentary control.

3
One example is by this instrument that the proposed tax on financial transactions (FTT) was supported by
11 of the 28 states and is therefore came into force on 1st January 2014.
4
The Community method means the decision-making process in which the Commission and the European Parliament play
a key role, which ensures that Member States will be treated equally, regardless of their size
demographic or economic weight and Treaty rules will apply; conversely, the method
Intergovernmental decision means the process by which a set (more or less) of Member State
agrees on the purpose and conditions of a project; since these are set outside the Treaty rules, they are
less transparent or opaque and less democratic, as the European Parliament representing the citizens (ne) s
European (ne) s is not in any way involved. National parliamentary scrutiny is also in this case less
effective.

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter EUROPE - p 9/26

Proposal: Enable clauses "gateways" for a more effective Europe
democratic
Ecolo advocate for the use of the terms "bridging" of the Lisbon Treaty and whose
name is explained by the possibility of changing flexible decision making in areas
where unanimity and / or lack of formal involvement of the European Parliament are still the rule
(such as taxation, foreign policy or certain employment policy). These bridging clauses
allow, following an agreement of Heads of State and Government and without waiting for a
Treaty change, to switch these areas in the field where the majority of those
and qualified as co-legislator the European Parliament is the only rule. The way, the
bridging clauses are flexible instruments that make Europe move towards more
efficiency and democracy.

Proposal: Pass the enlargements of the European Union
Ecolo supports the admission of the Balkan countries and Turkey in the Union
European. As such, Ecolo has supported and welcomed the accession of Croatia in July 2013.
This admission is conditioned to the respect of so-called "Copenhagen" criteria. Ecolo insists
particularly on respect for human rights, minority rights, public freedoms,
freedom of the press, justice and impartiality of the rule of law. Thus, the situation in Cyprus
it must be set prior to the entry of Turkey into the Union.
Furthermore, it should be noted that Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Iceland are currently
candidates for accession to the European Union. If it is likely that these countries adhere to the
next decade, it is important that these future enlargements strengthen the Union, without
unravel and that national governments take responsibility.
Significant financial support and solidarity must be proposed in order to succeed at best
the integration of new and future members and avoiding imbalances within the Union.
In this sense, the current trend of reducing the contribution of national governments is
senseless. This is why a European budget increased and fed own resources
essential for the proper functioning of the EU and the achievement of its objectives.
Moreover, for these extensions run as smoothly as possible, it is important that the opinion
Public will be prepared by national governments and without taboos or stereotypes.
Finally, any further enlargement must take into account the EU's institutional capacity to cope
the arrival of new members so as not to affect the decision making.

PRIORITY 2: ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE TO THE SERVICE OF THE ECONOMY
REAL AND ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION
The legislature was marked by the crisis of sovereign debt. It was so serious that
the unity of the euro area and the existence of the single currency were endangered. More than
twenty European Councils of the "last chance" have succeeded, with the objective to get out
EU ruts once and for all. But, for lack of medium-term vision,
ambition and courage and in the short term because of the divergence of national interests,
anachronistic electoral cycles of the "big" countries, no credible and convincing agreement could
be forged, both for financial markets and for European citizens and businesses. As
advanced real, they have failed to materialize or when we went from words to action
it remained timid. It has been so from the tax on financial transactions,
banking union or the pooling of part of the public debt.

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter EUROPE - p 10/26

The only thing that was conducted with a real sense, since the emergence of the idea to its
implementation, lies in the austerity policy that was also driving with an obstinacy
unshakeable as counterproductive, as finally recognized the International Monetary Fund.
Convergence of economic and budgetary policies of the member states is, however, a
necessity, but the angle and rules chosen to design this convergence are highly
questionable.

Proposal: Spend the triple convergence fiscal, social and
Environmental
European economic governance should be reformed with a view to convergence and
fiscal consolidation in the service of social and environmental objectives in the short,
medium and long term and thus leave policies whose only horizon is a balanced budget.
It needs :
To review thoroughly the current rules of economic governance;
To develop the indicators taken as a reference (with the addition of social inequality, the rate
unemployment, productivity and capital resources) and procedures
Monitoring of States;
Integrate these measures known as the six-pack and two-pack mechanisms
counter-cyclical, that is to say measures that will avoid that austerity conducted
amplifies the crisis and complicating the return to a healthy socio-economic situation. It
Password for example the possibility for Member States to exempt from the calculation of
public deficits part of public investment oriented ecological transition,
especially in a rollover in economic conditions;
Create an interdepartmental unit of the ecological transition, backed by management
General General Affairs of the European Commission to ensure compliance with
the balance of this triple convergence. The President of the Commission shall report to
European Parliament on this subject in his speech on the State of the Union.

Proposal: Undertake structural reforms in line with the transition
ecological economy
The concept of "structural reforms" acts as a scarecrow because there are usually
the associated flexibility of the labor market, at least partial privatization of security
social or hardening of the conditions of eligibility for replacement income, and
layoffs in public services.
Nevertheless, for Ecolo, the ecological transition of the economy underlying the implementation of reforms
structural taking a different direction: smart grid5, renewable energy, better
management of resources, support of workers in the labor market by providing access to
adequate replacement training and income, etc. Such reforms should be
encouraged. Impact assessments subject to consultation by interested parties must
contribute to enhancing compliance with the reform objectives relating
employment, fight against poverty, education / training, innovation and energy / climate.

5
A smart grid is an electricity network that can integrate in a cost-effective behaviors and
actions of all users connected to it - producers, consumers, users and both producers and
consumers - in order to develop economically efficient and sustainable systems, with losses
low and high levels of safety and quality and security of supply. (Definition of the Commission
European).

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter EUROPE - p 11/26

Conditionalities made financial assistance from the European Stability Mechanism, and
that the recommendations by the EU to various Member States should also take into
by that definition of structural reforms.

Proposal: Strengthen the role of the European Parliament in the definition of
socio-economic priorities of the EU
In recent years, a process called "European Semester" was launched to
synchronize cycles of budgetary and economic decisions of national and European level,
for purposes of coordination and maximization of synergies. The European Semester, which extends from
January to June (the second half being that of implementation) was launched at the
publication by the European Commission of a document called 'Annual Review for
growth ". This contains the socio-economic priorities that will prevail for the rest of
the year and for which the Member States will be judged. They will receive if
appropriate recommendations that will also give rise to newsletters, including non-compliance
in countries facing major downturns could lead to sanctions
political and financial.
For Ecolo, these priorities must be a work of amendments and a vote in Parliament
Europe to ensure the legitimacy of the process.

Proposal: To systematize the hearings, with the national social partners,
upstream of the major socio-economic events
As a corollary, Ecolo proposes that systematic hearings are held with
social partners in the presence of Prime Minister, before any major event for
economic and social policy, especially before the Spring European Council which
guidance for the months to follow are set and before the national reform programs
and stability programs are submitted by the government to the Commission. The parliament
Europe also has to systematize the hearings of the European social partners in relation
with the horizontal social clause (Article 11 of the Treaty).

Proposal: Conduct an audit of public debt
For Ecolo, the objective debt audit is to determine the different amounts that the
up to avoid the calculation criteria of the Pact of Stability and Growth and
découlent6 the procedures in the part of the debt related to cyclical policies or
bank bailout by communities.

Proposal: Consolidate financial solidarity within the euro area
Ecolo supports the idea that financial solidarity mechanisms among Member States of the
Euro area are planned, designed and implemented to prevent these States bogged down in
an economic and financial downturn and that the invoice for taxpayers alourdisse
Europe, because of slow action too late and modest. These mechanisms should be
transparent, based on objective criteria, particularly in terms of social justice and efficiency
economic order and contribute to the cohesion of the monetary union.

What is already possible, but implicitly and partially via the regulation on excessive deficits.

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter EUROPE - p 12/26

Proposal: Pooling gradually sovereign debt of states
Member
The "Eurobonds" 7 must finally be implemented. They are a means to pool
sovereign debt and allow states to the euro zone to cheaper finance.
A European agency should be responsible for the issuance of "Eurobills" 8 to meet
short-term financing needs of all European states. They assume
joint and several guarantee for these securities. The establishment of "Eurobills" could
rapidly and without modification of treaties.
In the same vein, Ecolo proposes the establishment of a "redemption fund" to
pool temporarily (25) a portion of government debt over time, and only
for the part beyond the threshold of 60% of GDP. Because of the guarantee that would give countries
Participants, including the AAA rated countries like Germany, the fund must be able to borrow
money on financial markets at rates far below those currently paid
by countries in financial difficulty.
In consideration of the benefits that would flow in, States would still be forced to
exercise fiscal discipline as developed above. The mere announcement of creation
such a tool, and as it is firm, credible and binding, could immediately
result in lower rates.

Proposal: Start of "project bonds" to finance investments
mobilizing for the actors of the real economy and the transition
ecological
In 2012 started a project bonds pilot experiment overseen by the European Bank

Investment. These project bonds designate the bonds that are issued to finance a
special project, namely transport infrastructure, energy and the top network
debit.
Through them, private investment mobilized for projects that, by their
scale, would remain on the side, without such funding. In exchange, investors
see paying a predetermined yield.
The experience must continue expanding the type and size of the projects: to help
certain regions or countries, European project bonds could involve local projects.
The selected projects must be validated by the cell of the ecological transition qu'Ecolo offers
created elsewhere (see above).

7
In November 2011, the European Commission considered three types of Eurobonds or Eurobonds. This term
reference to securities that may be issued jointly by the countries of the euro in order to support area
lower cost, taking advantage of a share of a more liquid market (for larger) than their own bonds
their national open and secondly, interest rates across most advantageous. Eurobonds may be
fully replace the issuance of national states obligations or be used in parallel (the "new" debt).
Additionally, Ecolo wishes pooling debt maturity less than one year. Different types
consideration of eurobonds are distinguished by the extent of the security given and the degree of substitution of national debt.
Depending on the desired level of ambition, a Treaty change might be necessary; it will indeed be the case if their
introduction is accompanied by a joint and several guarantee, which would imply maximum protection.
8
The Eurobills are in EU jargon, titles of debt with a short maturity; they therefore finance debt
short term. The volume of Eurobills issued for each State should never exceed 10% of GDP. The proposal aims
including creating a liquid market for banks, which may face difficulties in complying with
rules on capital adequacy (Basel III). It also allows states in financial difficulty to refinance, in part,
lower rates than today.

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter EUROPE - p 13/26

Proposal: Making the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) more transparent
and better controlled
The European Stability Mechanism, which was created as a permanent instrument comes from a
intergovernmental process which the European Parliament is totally excluded. That is why
Ecolo proposes to integrate the MES in the Community acquis, to be subject to
obligation to be accountable to Parliament, in accordance with the commitment
Eurogroup (comprising the ministers of eurozone finance). Joint meetings with
national parliaments and the European Parliament must improve the democratic process,
provided that, ultimately, national parliaments have budgetary prerogative.
The Minister of Finance who sits on it for Belgium should also be amenable to a discussion
with the Committee on Finance of the federal Parliament before and after each board meeting
MY Executive, to account for the decisions taken (and their financial impact
Belgium) and developments in the countries concerned, not only in terms
budget but also socially and environmentally.

Proposal: Give a banking license to the ESM to reduce costs
financing difficulties of States
The European Stability Mechanism shall be issued a banking license in order to access
directly to the European Central Bank and to benefit countries in which difficulties
it intervenes preferential financing conditions, significantly better than the rate of
market. It is unacceptable that the States - and their peoples - are paying the price of the crisis while
at the most critical moment of it, the European Central Bank put them on a drip
private banks (with maximum funding opportunities which represented 1% in
Indeed, a negative rate given the level of inflation).

Furthermore, should the ESM could, according to previous European agreements, intervene
to recapitalize the banks with serious difficulties signs provided that the conditions
stringent are asked to avoid problems of moral9 alea.

Proposal: Dismantle the troïka10 and in the meantime, subject to the control
Democratic Parliament
Before requesting support from the International Monetary Fund to rescue a country in serious
financial difficulties, Ecolo proposes that the Commission requests a mandate from Parliament
European - MEPs having previously voted on the relevance to call in the IMF - and
Council balisera the contours of the intervention of the Troika.
In the same way that the MES, the troika must also be accountable to Parliament
European. The European Central Bank, which is part can not hide behind
independence guaranteed by the Treaty or behind the argument that transparency would undermine the
countries by exposing weaknesses on the financial markets, to escape his
responsibilities, even that work in committee are conducted in camera.
Its role should be redesigned so that it no longer intervenes as an observer - not
negotiator - that it does not interfere in areas that do not comes out of its competence
as the labor market for example. The European Investment Bank should be

By moral hazard is meant here the situation might happen because banks would get the guarantee they
will be rescued in the event of serious problems, which could encourage them to take excessive risks and to alller
against measures taken to clean and reréguler the sector.

In the context of the economic crisis in Europe, the troika denotes the group of experts from the Commission

involved so as to counteract national reforms and measures with a plan
concerted investment furthering crisis. The European Agency Rights
Fundamentals should monitor interventions to prevent the recommendations of the troika
do not infringe the provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Charter
of Social Rights. The social partners must be involved in the development and implementation
implement adjustment programs and the Council of Ministers of Labour must also
have a voice.

Proposal: Establish a temporary capital controls in case of (threats
of) financial storms
To protect the difficulties countries to a sudden and massive withdrawal of capital causing a
significant deterioration in their balance of payments, the EU must ensure embody Article
64 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. It provides that the Council "unanimously and after
consulting the European Parliament, adopt measures which constitute a step back in
EU law as regards the liberalization of capital movements to or
from third countries. " In other words, free movement of capital control may be
temporarily restored.

Proposal: Establish a qualified majority for tax policy
Despite the obvious cross-border effects of national tax policies (like dumping
tax), taxation is one of the latest materials to remain subject to the unanimity rule,
thus immobility.
As part of the reform of the Treaties, Ecolo proposes that tax policies are set to
qualified majority and that the principle of progressive taxation is recognized explicitly. It
also facilitate the fight against evasion and tax fraud. Legislation should be adopted
to set a minimum corporate tax rate.

Proposal: Extend the mandate of the European Central Bank
Since its creation, the European Central Bank has been given the mission to maintain rates
inflation in line with price stability, that is to say close to 2% per year. It should
expanding the mandate of the ECB, in its determination of interest rates and its decisions
use the instruments available to it, it takes into account job creation.
Just like what is practiced in Belgium, where the social partners are present in the Council
Regency of the National Bank of Belgium, representatives of the social partners
Europe should serve on the General Council of the Bank as part of his duties
Consultative (annual reporting). The social partners play an role
in determining wage policy, often presented as an important element of
inflation or the adjustments made.

Proposal: To give a seat in the eurozone in financial institutions
international
While the euro has become in a few years, a reserve currency and its
credibility is well established, the political management of the European currency is more than lacking.
Unlike the World Trade Organisation (WTO) As the EU is a major player and
unavoidable, the countries of the euro zone weigh little the IMF or the World Bank. It
is explained by the fact that trade policy is a competence of the Communities
European and that only the Commission, which defends the mandate defined by States
members. Regarding monetary matters, each country clings to his seat,

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter EUROPE - p 15/26

contradiction with commitments from 1974 (Copenhagen Declaration, well before
the euro) and 1998 (on the occasion of a European Council) and were repeated frequently. The Treaty
Lisbon has addressed this deficiency by providing a unified representation in
international financial institutions, to establish a "euro diplomacy" to avoid
adjustments of large global imbalances focus on the euro but this
possibility was ignored until now.

Proposal: Make formulas "G" transparent
Ecolo remains opposed to any instance decisions and political impulses (international) who
lacks democratic legitimacy, especially when, as is the case with
international meetings of great powers in the G7 format, G8 and G20, they take
Above the UN multilateralism. These meetings are of great powers, in addition,
characterized by opacity and a European perspective, they create two de facto
classes of member states: those who have access to these meetings and others. Ecolo calls;
these meetings are attended by international organizations of employers and
workers and where appropriate, other representative organizations and
legitimate;
European participants in these meetings appear before the European Parliament to
to report on the conclusions of these summits and the implications for Europe and the
assessed in the light of the resolutions adopted by MEPs in association with
representatives of national parliaments in good time before the meetings.

PRIORITY 3: RE-legitimize the MULTI-YEAR BUDGET AND CHARTING THE WAY OF A
FEDERAL BUDGET EUROPEAN

Proposal: Reforming the multiannual financial framework adopted in 2013
The EU's annual budget is part of a multiannual framework fixing the maximum
(ceilings) for each major category of dépenses11 for a period of 7 years, and the
possible flexibility between categories. The meeting of the European Parliament that will be the end
European elections in May 2014 and the new Commission whose mandate will begin at the end of
2014, should be able to conduct a review of the multiannual financial framework
(MFF) 2014 to 2020.
For Ecolo, the adoption of this framework must be accompanied by:
On the strengthening of financial amounts
In a major review of the framework and necessary policy changes to enable
the European budget to play a catalytic role of national investment,
supporting the ecological and just transition of the economy, while providing the European
means of its ambitions (operating expenses role on the world stage
including official development assistance);
In reducing the length of the frame to align the terms of five years of
Parliament and the European Commission;

11
These topics are: Competitiveness for growth and employment (including research, innovation, education,
social policy and Cohesion Fund); Preservation and management of natural resources (CAP, fisheries, development
Countryside and Environment); Citizenship, freedom, security and justice; European Union as a global player (action
Exterior of the Union outside the European Development Fund); Administration (institutions operating costs
or about 5% of the budget).

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter EUROPE - p 16/26

In a rendezvous clause, in order to adjust mid-term envelopes
budget, taking into account (the actual development) needs of different positions
finance, without it disrupts the overall balance of the financial framework.

Proposal: Funding the EU budget mainly from resources
own for a real European federal budget
The European budget is a prisoner of budgets, and therefore interest, national. The negotiation of the
multiannual financial framework to the European Council in 2013 and its results are a sad
illustration. Today, over 85% of the annual budget of the European Union is about 140
billion is powered solely by financing assimilated to nationales12 contributions
and that many Member States seeks to minimize. This fact has given rise, in
net contributors to an attitude summed up by the phrase "I want my money back", which puts
undermined the rationale of a common budget and undermine the principle of solidarity yet
founder of the Union. The current own resources consist of a part of human
and some specific customs duties on agricultural products, a uniform percentage
applied to the VAT base and RNB13.
For Ecolo, new own resources are possible and out of the shackles nécessaires14
state, foster a community logic and a rising power and responsibility
Parliament: a percentage of revenues from future TFF (transaction tax
financial), a major revision of perception or a VAT in the CO2 contribution
under the carbon market.
It is important to reform the system of own resources so that they
again become the main source of funding. They should gradually replace
the contribution based on the country's wealth (which is the origin of the accounts of apothecaries
between Member States and the corollary principle of "fair return") as the main source of
budget. To this end, the reform should reduce to a maximum of 40% share in budget
Union contributions based on gross national income (GNI) and terminate all current
rebates and other correction mechanisms, to give body gradually to a federal budget
European.

Proposal: To ensure the proper management and transparency of the EU budget
Require Member States to pay on time their contributions to the EU budget
The EU budget can not be in deficit. Therefore, there is a great risk that, if states
Members do not respect their commitment and pay their contributions late, the
EU structural funding is undermined, creating a damaging debt for all
actors who are awaiting European funding.
For Ecolo, for accounting purposes, "guarantee credit" should rhyme with "payment appropriations".

12
These contributions are based on statistical aggregates derived from Gross National Income (GNI) and VAT. They
therefore do not appear clearly in the national budgets.
13
Of the three current resources, only tariffs are a real Community tax increasingly minor
(14% of the budget) while the VAT and GNI revenues represented 84% of the funding, are simply taken from
tax revenues of Member States, after detours fairly complex calculations. From the initial goal of a budget
common, there is not much effect, since nothing distinguishes the current funding of a simple system
national contributions. In total, the current own resources are thus qualified only because they finance
the European budget.
14
The European Commission tabled a legislative package on new own resources by June 2011, including
simplification and slight change percentages levied on VAT, TFF on trade and action
bonds and derivative products with a rate of 0.1%, of which 2/3 of the product would be allocated to the EU budget and
reducing the right to collect traditional own resources.

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter EUROPE - p 17/26

Ensuring transparency of budget decisions
So as to ensure full information for citizens and proper parliamentary control,
all expenses and revenues resulting from decisions taken by the European institutions or
on their behalf, including lending, borrowing and guarantees, must be summarized on
annual basis, in a document annexed to the draft budget. A general view of the consequences
financial and budget of the Union's activities would be possible.
Ensure financial predictability projects
Moreover, in a spirit of good management of public funds, Ecolo proposes to introduce a
procedure to curb the excesses of costs related to major projects
as European energy infrastructure (ITER), spatial (GMES), etc. Thus, if the
latest projections show that made the final costs exceed by more than 25%
costs initially budgeted, the European Parliament as budgetary authority should keep a
debate to determine whether it is wise to complete that project and, where appropriate, set
conditions.

Proposal: To provide a single location in the European Parliament
Ecolo is resolutely in favor of a single implementation of the European Parliament in Brussels. This
sense-making must end a parliamentary transhumance equally harmful to
the environment and efficiency, image, visibility and democratic institution budget
European.
Indeed, at present, the European Parliament is split between three places of work: Strasbourg
for plenary sessions, Brussels for meetings of the Committees, the political groups and
the 'mini-sessions' and finally Luxembourg for a large part of administrative services. The
corollaries are inefficiencies and huge financial and environmental costs,
respectively estimated at 180 million € and 19,000 tonnes of CO2.

PRIORITY 4: ADOPT A NEW SOCIAL PACT
Highly questionable choices made in terms of economic governance and budgetary
disrupt national and European social policies, even if they are not,
in the current state of the Treaties, directly from EU competences.
For Ecolo, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, should nevertheless
continue the work, whether to transpose directives, regulations or
recommendations on:
fight against poverty and social exclusion;
gender equality;
improving the health of citizens:
protection of workers' health
frame of the working environment;
support for public services and general interest;
quality of housing;
green pricing and integral energy and energy efficiency.
A number of these battlefields are the subject of specific proposals in
sectoral chapters of this program.

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter EUROPE - p 18/26

The European social dialogue is itself failed. The Commission has attempted or the
Resuscitate, or take over through its right of initiative by submitting legislative proposals
the Council and the European Parliament. The safeguards and existing procedures have only scope
declamatory ; it should enable to restore the social model and to ensure real
counterweight to steamroller policy choices in economic and budgetary matters.

Proposal: Re-establish the European social dialogue
Overcome the failure of social dialogue
In case of failure of social dialogue, for example because of the intransigence of a party to start
discussions on a future proposal for social Directive, provided that one of the parties
is requesting, Ecolo offers a simple vote of the Committee on Employment Parliament
Europe is necessary for the Commission to be obliged to take over and to file a
proposal to the European Parliament and the Council.
Allow transnational collective bargaining
Since collective bargaining is a pillar of our European social model, Ecolo
supports the creation of an optional legal framework for transnational collective bargaining for
multinational enterprises operating in different countries of the European Union. This instrument must
be designed to avoid, in this way, it prejudice collective agreements
national or national company agreements. Specifically, the principles of the most clause
favorable and the non-regression must be at the heart of the device.

Proposal: Develop a European CNT
To overcome the difficulties of interpretation of agreements between the social partners
European and national counterparts have reappropriated, Ecolo proposes the creation of a
Permanent Secretariat of the intersectoral European social dialogue. This secretariat would act
Committee of Experts of the social partners, without hindering recourse to the courts and
courts try to reconcile different interpretations, and would ensure the development and implementation
monitoring of the agreements, whether the Directive or standalone type.

Proposal: Create a European agency ADR
social conflicts
Ecolo proposes the establishment of a European body of alternative dispute resolution
in terms of labor law, to develop and implement a sustainable solution with
the involvement of parties to the contract. This European body would intervene at the request of
European social partners on a voluntary basis and in each case, to solve
disputes extrajudicially, stating in particular the spirit of the "employment" directives in question.

Proposal: Attach the Lisbon Treaty a social progress clause and
sustainability
A social protocol annexed to the Treaty and its translation by a transverse binding legislation
is essential to ensure the effectiveness of Article 9 of the Treaty on the Functioning of
the European Union (TFEU) 15 which creates a social non-regression clause. This clause would allow
15

Article 9 TFEU already a safeguard against certain policies "in the definition and implementation of
its policies and activities, the Union shall take into account requirements linked to the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee
of adequate social protection, the fight against social exclusion, and a high level of education, training and
protection of human health. " Its scope remains derisory in fact.

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter EUROPE - p 19/26

guide decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The objective of the protocol would be
clarify the relationship between fundamental social rights and freedoms related
single market.
Thus, representative and legitimate civil society of a country could
turn to the Commission when they consider that a national policy violates this clause. There
Commission is required to review the situation and, if necessary, to require the State concerned to
restore the situation. If, as appropriate, it does not comply, financial or political sanctions
could be provided.
Ecolo as proposed in the social field, the idea of ​​a non-regression clause
"Sustainable development" should be paid from Article 11 TFEU. The / the Commissioner
Climate load, named (e) Vice-President (e) of the Commission will be responsible for ensuring the
respect, in line with the Commissioners in charge of Employment, Social and
Economy.

Proposal: Match all legislative proposals and all plans
Action of a listing "horizontal clauses"
All new legislative proposals and any new action plans should be
always accompanied by a listing "horizontal clauses" that analysis, succinctly and
if possible in quantitative form, the expected impacts of the proposals on equal hommesfemmes, social protection, education, human health, non-discrimination,
sustainable development and protection of consommateurs.16 This should allow
European legislators and interested organizations and citizens to better assess the
scope and consequences of the new proposed texts.
As part of the reform of the Treaties, this plug must be analyzed by a committee
Economic and Social strengthened, which have a period of three months to validate or contest
giving reasons for its conclusions. The Commission will review its proposal, if any, or
inform the Committee, the European Parliament, the Council and the Regions Committee of the reasons for
which would maintain intact its analysis.

PRIORITY 5: BOUND BY THE TERMS SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL A
SCALE OF EUROPE AND THE WORLD
Proposal: Establish rights to environmental and social customs
the scale of the European Union
To protect our economy and protect our workers effects of a global market
deregulated and in accordance with the possibilities opened by the rules of the World Organization of
(WTO) and European Union (EU), Ecolo proposes the introduction of customs duties
social and environmental at European level in respect of goods and services produced in
problematic social and environmental conditions in emerging countries. This is
a powerful tool that the EU can and should use to contribute to high
social and environmental standards in those countries and make them comparable to
that the EU is necessary. Beyond that, it's an interesting track for the crisis, the
relocation of the economy and reducing transportation requirements and CO2 emissions.
The introduction of such social and environmental duties would constitute an obvious capital gain on the grounds of both economic, social and environmental ... in reverse
16

In accordance with the general provisions of the Treaty as set out in Articles 8 to 12 of the Treaty
Functioning of the European Union.

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter EUROPE - p 20/26

austerity policies of the Member States whose economic and social effects
dramatic.
Specifically, basic social standards (such as freedom of association, recognition
the effective right to collective bargaining, prohibition of forced labor or children, equality
wage gender, etc.) of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and standards
Environmental arising from the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development held in Rio de Janeiro from 3 to 14 June, 1992, the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 and
the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in 1992, should be much
useful references to regulate trade with countries outside Europe and especially
incentives for them to improve the well-being of their population. Thus, through the device
proposed, these standards will be as many motivations for countries in trade relations
with the EU to improve their social and environmental performance, and they will reward
their efforts in this area.
Conversely, this device penalize countries that derive part of their competitive advantage in the
Non-compliance with such social or environmental standards or an aggressive policy rate
exchange as their currency is kept artificially low. Tax revenues
seen by the EU as a levy these tariffs will
mainly allocated to the strengthening of solidarity with the South and the fight against
climate change. They will contribute to both meet these critical objectives and
redeployment of the European economy.
In no event it does is create a blind protectionism. The aim is to fight
against social and environmental dumping which, while detrimental to the competitiveness of our
companies, violates the rights of workers and depletes resources that some countries
exporting to Europe. Compliance with these standards should guide the global economy on the way
sustainable development and allow, among others, the development of local commerce,
support to short circuits and relocated some jobs.

Proposal: Integrate respect for social and international standards
environment in trade agreements
Environmentalists will ensure that a binding clause on respect for standards of Nations
UN, ILO and the Union itself for labor law and environmental law,
including multilateral environmental agreements, should be included in all agreements
investment and all trade agreements signed by the European Union. She has to be
accompanied by measures to verify the proper implementation of these principles across
of the Union.

PRIORITY 6: ENSURE A VOICE TO THE EUROPEAN UNION ON THE SCENE
INTERNATIONAL

Proposal: Strengthen the Union for the Mediterranean

This new association of states includes Mediterranean countries but does not yet have
budgetary and human resources to strengthen and become credible. It is now
lined with a Parliamentary forum could become an area of ​​diplomacy and cooperation
Parliamentary valuable, given the democratic transitions under way.
Only alternative to trade deals that are rarely to the benefit of the local economy,
great forum could help address environmental, social issues and a
sustainable economic development.

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter EUROPE - p 21/26

To do this, concrete field actions must be carried out, which require
more budgetary resources.

Proposal: Make fairer trade agreements negotiated by the EU
with developing countries
Since 2003, the EU embarked on a new trade round with countries
development in the context of the Cotonou Agreement. But these agreements focus
mainly on the removal of trade barriers between these countries and the Member States
EU at the expense of the environment, leading to intensive land use and
resources. This liberal logic has serious environmental consequences but also
social in these countries.
Thus, the European Union could become a shield against unregulated globalization and not
one of its agents by reducing the asymmetry of liberalization agreements to focus on
real causes of poverty in developing countries.

Proposal: Make more transparent negotiation of agreements signed with
third-country
Negotiating agreements between the EU (and / or the Member States) with third countries
place under the leadership of the European Commission, with the agreement of the Member States meeting
Cabinet. The European Parliament on the scene that upon ratification of these
agreements.
The secret negotiations within the framework of ACTA Treaty and the revelations of the contents of the mandate on
The liberalization agreement between the European Union and the United States have shown that this process
was undemocratic and was detrimental to the fundamental rights of European citizens.
Therefore Ecolo requests that the European Parliament be involved from the drafting of the mandate
negotiation by national ministers to ensure that the common interest and the interests
European citizens are protected.
Ecolo and the European Greens will continue to support, with the Belgian Government and
European Commission, the imposition of a moratorium on current negotiations
on the commercial and transatlantic free trade as the United States Government Agreement will not shed light on illegal wiretaps in which institutions and
European citizens currently appear to be. For further negotiations, Ecolo
wishes the Commission to follow strict guidelines throughout this process, as
respecting social and environmental standards, the protection of public services, that of
consumers, personal data, backing an agricultural vision
European or European cultural exception. Any form of regression in these
areas or reréguler reforms to the financial system under the pretext of
Regulatory convergence between the United States and Europe would be unacceptable.

Proposal: To defend human rights worldwide
The European Union can not be a Union of law if it does not contribute to the respect of
fundamental rights in its external action.
This means:
Not recognizing the elections that were characterized by irregular missions
election observation;

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter EUROPE - p 22/26

Condition the signing of trade agreements and economic partnership with the
prohibition of child labor, labor rules defined by the Organization
International Labour to the prohibition of the death penalty ...;
Organize an international conference on respect for personal data and
privacy of citizens.

Proposal: To ensure the EU representation within the ONU17
The United Nations was founded in 1945 after World War II, by
big winners of War. The current structure does not meet the challenges of the modern world or
new regional balances. Reform is thus needed to give all
chances at the UN to better fulfill its tasks as defined in its Charter. A review
the mode of functioning of the Organization is therefore indispensable reform which the Union
Europe must be at the forefront internationally and to obtain a voice to share it
whole.
In this context, Ecolo proposes:
change the composition of the Security Council to ensure greater
representativeness across the globe, based on a representation of
regional groupings. The European Union would therefore be a member of the Security Council
instead of some of its member states;
in the meantime, to establish a transitional period in which the right of veto which
benefit the UK and France would be exercised by the European Union, before its
deletion.

Proposal: Making the EU more independent of OTAN18
The defense of Europe has been built since the early days of the Cold War around the structure
NATO, under the control of the United States. For the sake of consistency but also a
context of scarce budgetary resources, it is essential to establish a
European defense integrating different national contingents in a structure
common.
This new structure and strengthen the European position on the world stage
allowing the Union to send forces to peacekeeping as part of operations
civil security outside the NATO framework.
The EU must also be able to provide the means to turn more easily, if necessary, its
rapid intervention forces.

International relationships
INTERNATIONAL
Converging worlds around
solidarity and sustainable development
Status and political horizon
State of play
Since the beginning of this century, the world has experienced many changes and a double
Failover occurred in international relations. On the one hand, more and more states
contribute to the international order and integrate the decision-making bodies, such as the passage of the G8
G20 attests. Moreover, this reversal of the unipolar system is constructed around a
small minority controlling all economic workings and attempting to impose on the progress of
a neoliberal world look, while inequalities are growing. Of these developments was born
belief that the political order as it consists no longer able to cope with problems
the most serious and which should restore social democratic forms of expression. The
challenges and social demands, both in the countries of the southern shore of the Mediterranean
than in industrialized states like Brazil, Turkey, Spain, Greece, France or
Belgium still today reflect the commitment of the different civil societies to
up another economic model, social and egalitarian political, more social, more cohesive
and democratic.
Power relations are no longer the same, new players have taken or resumed
place on the world scene, such as China, Russia, Brazil, South Africa ...

Political horizon
The advent of a world in which the balance between large ensembles is réopèrent
therefore an opportunity to seize. It is proposing a new international structure based on
respect for peace and law, while facilitating dialogue between international actors.
The challenges ahead are significant and will require all players to do common work. There
Population growth in Asia and Africa will upset the major global balances. The
reduction of poverty and the rise of middle classes in depth alter the social,
especially in emerging countries. Inequality within states and between them, increase
yet, while armed commitments change their nature, falling in intensity but taking
different shapes. Finally, energy issues and access to resources, to face
more and more to the reality of their exhaustion, strongly influence international relations. he
will therefore be to do more with less, focusing on solidarity, sustainability, health and
protection of our ecosystems.
Faced with these developments and emerging issues, it is necessary to implement the instruments
and essential tools for a more socially equitable development so that all
components companies can benefit. This is to ensure the social, political,
environmental and economic citizens and engage the world on the path of transition
ecological. To these requirements must join a strong and serious commitment to give back
meaning human rights (Human Rights), as a collective duty, particularly around the

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper International Relations - International Chapter - 1:20 p

protecting the rights of women and minorities. A new pacifism must emerge, anchored
in absolute effort to prevent the causes of wars germinate. This is, ultimately, to
prepare for the future to better meet its challenges.

The Ecolo force lines for the international ecological transition
Renewing the international architecture
Develop a fair global governance, sustainable and democratic
Prevent conflict and promote peace
Develop a foreign policy marked, ethical and responsible

Priorities and policy proposals
PRIORITY 1: RENEW INTERNATIONAL ARCHITECTURE
The emergence of new international actors implies rethinking the international structure and
to give them a full role in the bodies and decisions of organs.
International institutions are increasingly paralyzed by a historical inheritance
corresponding more to world reality and issues of economic interests. Beyond
difficulty managing power relations in a multipolar world, the development of these
new players therefore an opportunity in terms of international and rebalancing
greater equality between actors. In the international arena, Belgium
can and must play a central role in this rebalancing process.

Proposal: Reforming the UN
First, to enable the UN to carry out the tasks conferred upon it by its Charter
founder, and therefore a secured financing, that is to say that can resist pressure
cyclical policies and lobbies, must be assigned.
In addition, Eco believes that a review of its operation is essential. For this
so, it is necessary to:
strengthen the role of the UN in the field of disarmament, "human security" and
civil conflict prevention in order to prevent the military and armed interventions, as
as possible;
work towards the abolition of the veto right of member states of the Security Council. This
law must be replaced by a voting procedure by qualified majority. In
interim period, it is however possible that the veto enjoyed by the
Britain and France are exercised by the European Union;
remove the distinction between permanent and non-permanent members and expand
the Security Council to new States to ensure better representation in
the global scale, particularly in the sense of a representation of sets
regional (eg the European Union and the African Union);
consider the eventual creation of a parliamentary assembly of the United Nations to
strengthen the democratic nature of democratic accountability and transparency of the
global governance and allow for greater participation of citizens in
United Nations activities. The process of creating this meeting must involve
governmental and non-governmental;

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper International Relations - International Chapter - p 2/20

to play an increased role for civil society within the UN, based on its expertise
both upstream (local knowledge, conflict detection / problems ...) and downstream
(assistance in developing solutions);
improve the transparency of decisions. It should, for example, that the discussions and
discussions among the five permanent members of the Security Council are subject to
written reports and public. Similarly, the right of defense must be via
the requirement for the audition of the Security Council of States likely to be
sanctions;
increase the presence of women in decision-making positions and taking into account the impact
war on women and children and hence the importance of the participation of
these in all aspects of peacekeeping operations and peace negotiations
peace agreements;
improve training and supervision of soldiers (to avoid phenomena as
unacceptable that rape by peacekeepers for example). The participation
troops of Western countries must, moreover, be prosecuted and defended by
Belgium within the UN.

Proposal: Establish a global organization environment1
Ecolo proposes the creation of a World Environment Organization, whose mission would be
assist countries and companies in their transition to a post-fossil energy and uranium era and
their mastery of greenhouse gas emissions. This institution would encourage
development and dissemination of renewable energy, energy efficiency technologies
and technologies for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in all member countries.
This organization would also be responsible for preserving biodiversity and improving the state of
the environment (air quality, water, soil) to improve the health of every citizen
of our planet. It would be endowed with binding powers and sanctioning capacity and
take over the UN prerogatives Program for Environment (UNEP) and the
Fund for Global Environment. The organization would finally bridge institution of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity
biological.

PRIORITY 2: DEVELOPING A JUST WORLD GOVERNANCE, AND SUSTAINABILITY
DEMOCRATIC
Although the proportion of people living in extreme poverty is to be reduced in
the last 20 years and life expectancy has increased, the recent period has seen the
inequalities explode in the South and strengthen in the North.
For Ecolo, it is essential to reorient the international financial architecture in favor of a
sustainable development and submission of commercial partnerships and agreements
investment to binding social and environmental criteria.
Furthermore, Fair Trade represents an action that should guide trade
shopping with partners in both North and South.
Belgium must therefore play a leading role in international negotiations, such as
Conference of the Parties on Climate COP 20 in 2015, aiming to limit warming
Climate + 2 ° C compared to pre-industrial times and predict the consequences of
global warming on populations.

For more information on this proposal and proposals for Ecolo in energy, see Chapter "Energy and
Climate ".

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper International Relations - International Chapter - p 3/20

Proposal: Rethinking the international financial architecture and reform
international development finance institutions
International economic institutions are in crisis. Having failed to anticipate the crisis
Economic and respond effectively they raise profound questions about their
legitimacy. The International Monetary Fund and all sister institutions like the Bank
World and the World Trade Organization, the self-proclaimed directories such as the G8 and
G20 led and pursue policies that bring people to their knees. Austerity policies
the effect for the countries and people concerned can be compared to political
structural adjustment imposed on the South and the effects were devastating.
This requires a profound change in their aims and organization methods and a
greater transparency and a more democratic mode. The system
économique2 governance must also be managed by a set of regional institutions
under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council, which should itself be modernized.
Reform of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
Discredited both the South and North, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should be
deeply reformed and should now focus on financial regulation (stability
Monetary, fight against speculation, control capital movements ...) and Monitoring
imbalances in the world economy in order to prevent crises.
IMF reform passes through:
strengthening political control and representation of the southern states, the
representation of regional blocs such. The power of decision is now
proportional to the financial contribution of the States;
the inclusion of human rights, environmental and social values ​​in
policies of the institution and the return to its fundamentals: the "maintenance
high levels of employment and real income "and" resource development
productive of all members as primary objectives of economic policy "
(Article 1, paragraph 2 of its statutes)
the allocation of a greater role for civil society in defining orientations
policies while ensuring that it is not manipulated by the institutions
international financial (IFI).
Similarly, for Ecolo, the World Bank should:
refocus on financing essential public goods, including public goods
world, offering low interest rates and this while ensuring that programs
funded projects and be respectful of social, environmental and
fundamental human rights in recipient countries.
move towards more democratic modes and more
transparency. In Belgium and in the short term, demand that representatives Ecolo
Belgian IMF and World Bank to report on their activities twice a year before the
Parliament and representatives of civil society before spring summits and
Fall of international financial institutions.
Furthermore, Belgium must condition the payment of its contributions to the IMF and the Bank
World to the necessary democratization of the international institutions and the elimination of
economic conditionalities it imposes on today in exchange for developing countries
their financial assistance.

2
For more information on the proposals for Ecolo in economic and financial regulation, see Chapter
"Banking and financial regulation."

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper International Relations - International Chapter - p 4/20

More generally, Ecolo proposes the establishment of a commission in the federal Parliament,
responsible, firstly, to follow all the international commitments made by Belgium
(treaties, international trade negotiations ...) and, secondly, organize debates
upstream of the expression of the positions of Belgium within these institutions. The federated entities,
which are increasingly involved in the definition of the Belgian negotiating position
Cities, should also be involved.
The World Trade Organization's reform
Weakened by a decade of paralysis of the negotiations of the "Doha Round", the system
MTS must be profoundly rethought and reformed. At the heart of these issues,
the World Trade Organization (WTO) must leave his paralysis and commit to a
better management and reform of its objectives, in the service of ecological transition, labor
Decent and basic human rights. It is therefore appropriate:
to revise the statutes of the WTO, which are contrary to the objective of sustainable development and
incompatible with multinational commitments to human and social rights
and environmental protection;
to integrate the WTO in the UN as a specialized agency, so as to subordinate
Business treaties and agreements concluded within the framework of the United Nations. Concretely,

this means among other things the subordination of economic agreements with international reach
the core conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and agreements
International health and environmental protection;
to strengthen transparency and democratic control of the institution; improve
functioning of the dispute settlement mechanism at the WTO and to improve
taking the internal decision making process at the WTO, including through the restoration of
principle that all delegations had access to all the negotiations.

Proposal: Rethinking the Belgian and European trade policy and commitment
economic agreements to respect social, environmental and
human rights
Trade and investment promotion is one of the main components of the
Belgian international politics, but also the one that has the most direct impact on
populations. So that these trade and investment policies are serving the
sustainable development at global level, should be subject to strict compliance with the
social and environmental standards, as well as, more generally, compliance with the requirements
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Therefore, for Ecolo, it comes to renegotiate free trade agreements and WTO rules in order
to fight against the dumpings and promote régionales3 integrations. It is also about
renegotiate bilateral investment agreements (BITs) between Belgium and other countries to
they are more balanced in favor of the South, they contain an effective mechanism
binding control the implementation of social and environmental clauses and
respect for human rights and that they preserve the freedom of the States Parties to legislate and
regulation (particularly about the eminent domain) 4.
Ecolo also requires transparency practices of Belgian companies about their
investment in developing countries, their farms and their subcontractors. For exemple,
the South of resources such as land, timber, minerals, crops must be ...

3
The regional groups achieve a critical mass in international negotiations and
promote the circuits' medium and short. "
4
Although these agreements have become a competence of the European Union since the Lisbon Treaty, states
Members retain the right to negotiate new agreements or renegotiate old ABI if the Commission has not taken
supports the negotiation of a European ABI with a given country.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper International Relations - International Chapter - p 5/20

preserved. In this sense, Ecolo proposes making binding compliance by companies
transnational corporations and their subsidiaries, social and environmental standards, such as the directives
volunteers on land governance (2012) of the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the conventions of the International Labour Organisation
decent work.
In line with these objectives, the federal and regional governments must establish a mandate
to the European Commission that addresses these concerns.
Finally, in the context of free trade agreements resulting from the Cotonou Agreement, it is appropriate
to move towards a post-Cotonou agreement with the principles and objectives of the transition
ecological and sustainable development. Indeed, the current relationship, based on a
exploitation of natural resources of the South, will fail to promote the emergence of a
ecological transition both in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere.

Proposal: Ensuring decent work
The International Labour Organisation (ILO) is responsible for bringing together the various stakeholders
International to promote decent work. It must also be the institution
inescapable that ensures respect for workers' rights be included in all
international agreements and act with all institutions and international actors
concerned.
This is for Ecolo to promote universal respect for decent minimum income covering
the basic needs of workers and their families. It is therefore necessary to create,
protecting and maintaining decent jobs, undermined by austerity policies and
competitiveness, both North and South, and the virtual absence or weakness of mechanisms
assessment and effective monitoring.
It should:
integrate decent work, targets and indicators in the mandatory annual report
Belgian development cooperation that the Government present at the Belgian Parliament;
to ensure that decent work objectives are well represented in the goals
International who will continue the effort of the Millennium Development Goals;
in general, to ensure respect for decent work objectives in all
policy of Belgium in international organizations;
to end all discrimination in employment, to ensure the respect of freedom
trade unions and the rights of all workers, including migrants, from
agricole5 or informal sector;
to fight against child labor in the North and South and implement
means for their schooling.

Proposal: Develop a global agreement on
climate governance
Today, countries that have a numerical target under the Kyoto Protocol produce less
50% of greenhouse gas emissions. It is therefore essential that all countries
industrialized, starting with the US, and all countries with an emerging economy
are involved in future agreements, while taking into account the differentiated action capacities
different regions of the world in order to achieve a real global agreement on
climate governance.

The common objective must be respect for trajectories for emissions reduction
greenhouse gas to limit the temperature increase to a maximum of 2 ° C, taking into
the responsibilities and means of chacun6.
In this context, Ecolo proposed as basic international negotiations:
to determine, in the short term for emerging reduction targets
"Relative" (in terms of energy efficiency by sector for example) or stabilization
absolute emissions;
to develop international solidarity mechanisms in the interests of fairness and under
penalty of up strong pressure from the victim countries upheavals
climate;
develop parallel strategies for adaptation to climate changes in
current and expected;
to transfer without waiting to emerging countries, especially the poorest countries,
the knowledge and the most advanced technologies in production
renewable energy, energy efficiency, rational use of energy and
adaptation to global warming;
to negotiate a partnership between the European Union, China and India, and even Brazil,
(technological partnership, exchange of emission rights, for example), which should
help facilitate a multilateral international agreement;
to reform and improve the international tools (development mechanisms
clean) 7 in the fight against climate change. The budget for
these tools can not be accounted for in the budgets of cooperation
development.

Proposal: Protecting civilians and refugees
In a prevention perspective, it is to address upstream causes that provoke
wars, conflicts and democratic instability. One factor often overlooked is the situation of
minorities in many parts of the globe. These minorities, whose existence is sometimes
totally unknown to the general public or political, are the subject of discrimination
cultural, social, political or economic important and are often denied their
identity. The recognition of minorities in their right to existence and dignity is paramount
in particular to promote an intercultural environment. Recognition, dialogue and
participation in all aspects of political, social, economic and cultural life, combined with
enhanced regional cooperation are of crucial importance in preventing
ethnic or racial conflicts.
Protect and promote the rights of women8
Too often, the rights of women are uninsured, or even recognized, and are
violated in various parts of the world. Thus, women are more likely than men
poverty and precariousness. But many of them are subjected to unspeakable violence,
their eviction from the democratic process in use of rape as a weapon of war.
However, violence against women are not individual problems, but rather a
issue to society head on. It is therefore essential to ensure equal
participation of women in decision-making processes and their inclusion in development
economic and social development of their regions.

On the other hand, face the many conservative currents that threaten women's rights
to decide their sexual and reproductive lives, it should pay particular attention to
financing of programs aimed at strengthening, in partner countries, sex education,
access to information and effective contraception for everyone and effectiveness of
reproductive and sexual rights.
Furthermore, the United Nations Resolution 1820 requires parties to a conflict to take all
the necessary steps to stop rape and other sexual violence against
civilians, as well as the impunity of those responsible. These provisions must be accompanied
effective and binding mechanisms for monitoring and should be coupled with other policies such
the rehabilitation of the rule of law, health services and education.
For Ecolo, it should include:
to strengthen the presence of women in local decision-making bodies, national,
regional and international, as well as key positions (Chair of the Commission
European, Secretariat of the United Nations, etc.);
broaden the participation of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts, as well as
the consolidation of peace, in accordance with resolution 1325 of the United Nations. Indeed,
the impact of war on women is well established, hence the importance of their
participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations;
to allocate sufficient financial and human resources to the actors (UN, NGOs,
governments, etc.) present on site to be able to monitor (access to
justice, community reintegration ...) and assistance (medical and
... psychological) appropriate to victims of sexual violence. An information work,
Prevention and long-term monitoring should be further continued and extended to
educate local communities and authorities and armed groups;
ensure post-conflict monitoring for sexual violence do not end with an agreement
cease-fire or peace; This trend is reinforced by the rest the myth that
sex with a virgin can prevent or cure AIDS;
to exert more pressure on the governments of countries affected by violence
Sexual used as weapons of war, so they put an end to the impunity
for those responsible for such crimes and put in place a judicial system
effective ;
to support and promote the role of civil society in general and movements
women in particular.
Belgium should, in addition, engage in international advocacy to encourage ratification
and the implementation of the Protocol on Women's Rights, adopted by the African Union, which marks
an important step in the recognition of women's rights and their alignment on
international goals.
Define the status of climate refugees
The impact of climate change is being felt in many parts of the globe and touches the
First the most vulnerable populations in the South and rank. Significant movements (internal and
international) populations have already occurred and are likely to increase in the coming years.
In this context, it is essential to recognize a specific status to refugees
climate at national and international level.
In addition, for Eco:
Belgium will advocate for the creation of an international fund, whose contribution
could be determined on the basis of the principle of responsibility of the countries in the
phenomenon of climate change. The decommitted among other means must
allow the resettlement of displaced persons and ensure livelihoods
enough ;

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper International Relations - International Chapter - p 8/20

national recognition, or even regional, is not sufficient, a structure (agency
at the United Nations, integration with the United Nations High Commissioner for
refugees or other) should be implemented worldwide;
should broaden the criteria of the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees
degradation of the environment and global warming;
Belgium must commit to the ten principles that reflect the Nansen
conclusions of the Nansen Conference on Climate Change and travel
population of the twenty-first century. These principles include a wide range of
recommendations to "guide the answers to some of the urgent and complex challenges
the displacement in the context of climate change and other risks
environmental ".

Proposal: Cancel the debt of developing countries and prevent
the unsustainable debt
The relief operation of the debt of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) 463
million € in 2011 resulted in a consequent reduction of the stock of receivables held by
Belgium vis-à-vis the least developed countries. In the coming years, Belgium will operate yet
relief same scale toward Sudan.
The debts of Sudan (€ 830.86 million), Zimbabwe (€ 82.28 million) to North Korea
(€ 53.30 million), Togo (€ 23.97 million) and Myanmar (€ 20.83 million) focus
the bulk of the remaining claims on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Aggregate debt
weigh other LDCs, for their part, as much as that of Zimbabwe (€ 89.03 million) 9.
To continue the relief efforts, Ecolo proposes the institution of a moratorium to freeze
interest on the repayment of loans granted by Belgium before 1 January 2009 to LDCs,
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and other developing countries with a deficit
substantial current. Ecolo also wants the creation of an Office of the compensation fund
National Ducroire (OND) and the establishment of an ad hoc expert committee to develop,
firstly a Belgian charter of responsible lending and on the other hand, audit reports, country by
country claims by Belgium vis-à-vis developing countries. In parallel,
Ecolo calls for the recognition of illegitimate and odious debt and debt concepts
écologique10.
Similarly, we must strengthen cooperation with States which are in the process of
recovery of fraudulently acquired assets, cases of Tunisia and Egypt, by making
their disposal the information, experience and judicial expertise and technical tools.

Proposal: Consider promoting global commons
The concept of public goods is an innovative concept. Neither private property, traded on the market and
only answering a logical individual profit or public goods produced by the state. They
may exist by the will of communities organize themselves to collectively manage a
resource to ensure sustainability sometimes with the support of the State.

Namely, Bangladesh (2.92), Gambia (0.6), Kenya (12,21), Malawi (2.6), Mali (8.2), Nepal (10.35), Niger (9.1 ), Congo
(13,63), Democratic Republic of Congo (0.4), Guinea (2.43 + 2.46), Guinea-Bissau (11.83), Benin (7.20), Tanzania
(5.1).
10
For illegitimate debt, it is to hear a debt that the use of funds did not benefit the population as a
situation where the balance of power in favor of the creditor, enjoying abusive conditions and having knowledge of
illegitimacy of the debt. Odious debt is a debt contracted by a despotic regime and / or dictatorial in
to consolidate his power and satisfy their interests, creditors knowing the destination of the loaned funds. A
Ecological debt is a debt accumulated by industrialized countries to developing countries and characterized by
looting of resources and damage to the environment, from industrialized countries.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper International Relations - International Chapter - p 9/20

It is therefore to establish the necessary mechanisms for their recognition, their
promotion and protection. It is for governments to encourage this by management
organized citizens regarding the most, in a participatory and democratic logic,
taking advantage of what public authorities, civil society and the market have to offer the best.
Because the fact of the ecological crisis, social and economic, many of these common goods are
danger.
Thus, the situation in the Arctic is of concern: the retreat of ice due to melting ice is
more and more important due to global warming. This area is increasingly
has come of age since traffic areas that emerge between Russia and the North
US and Europe. In 2011, Belgium has undertaken to promote further
international governance in the Arctic by an international protocol calling for a moratorium
on the exploitation of mineral resources. This is fully justified in view of the risks of all
form of operation and navigation in an extremely sensitive marine environment. It must
address the rights and needs of indigenous peoples and nations of the region. he
confirm the value of "world heritage" of the Arctic and will end
ownership of international waters. This will, for Ecolo, to ensure the implementation of this
Protocol and the instruments necessary for its implementation.
As in international treaties, Ecolo considers that the international seabed up
also a common heritage of humanity. Therefore, it will be essential to ensure
management in cooperation and not in competition, while respecting all forms of life
according to an objective of general interest, especially thinking of future generations.
Finally, Ecolo it is essential to undertake measures for the protection and access
all with water. Common Good of Humanity, the right to water must be guaranteed for everyone,
today and in the future. This right has been recognized by the United Nations (resolution 64/292
the United Nations General Assembly on 28 July 2010) and, thanks to
social movements. This is to reject any form of commodification of this vital element
life. Public service delegations, public-private partnerships (PPP), permissions
pumping for commercial, technological choices ... do not guarantee the necessary
public and democratic control of water management. The privatization of water and its services
is not compatible with the fact that she is a good essential to life. For Eco, it is therefore
then, at the international level, to make it impossible that the water does not become a commodity,
to "work" the water as universal heritage (cross-border approach, wide Action
European and in favor of international solidarity), to ensure that water is managed
around a participatory approach and about its social use and create, to achieve this, the
transparent institutions and collaborators, not segmented.

PRIORITY 3: PREVENT CONFLICT AND PROMOTE PEACE
For environmentalists, political peace, security and Belgian and European defense
can be separated from other instruments for external action are cooperation
development and trade policies. If there are hard threats such as terrorism
and wars, more indirect threats such as hunger, epidemics, ethnic tensions,
climate change, economic inequality, women's rights violations and
kids ... cause as much, if not more, people than premières11.
With the emergence of conflicts, it is necessary to put in place the necessary means to
prevention and promotion of peace. It is also reaffirm that the use of force
to resolve conflicts can only be the last resort. Thus, for Ecolo, three ideas
main are to promote:

11
Koffi Annan, In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all, NationsUnies, March 20, 2005.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper International Relations - International Chapter - p 10/20

the principle of nonviolence in conflict resolution;
absolute commitment to efforts to prevent the causes of wars germinate;
the design of a system of peace through law based on compliance with commitments
International.
The actual implementation of these principles requires:
and a transversal policy coherence: the Treaties establishing "facilities"
bi- or multilateral trade (ABI or EPA currently very unequal)
with other Community policies on the environment, energy,
development, agriculture, fisheries and human rights, etc. it is important that
consistency is in order and that the democratic imperatives, social, environmental and
of peacekeeping are respected. External policies, defense and
Security can not be disconnected from other policies;
coaching coercive means used in the context of external relations,
improving the decision-making process both at Belgian and international level, the
denuclearization;
strengthening of international justice and the fight against impunity, considering
the means to punish non-State actors do not respect law
international regulations.
Finally, such thinking can only draw attention to the current European trends
security and defense. The European Union as a "global" actor must be distinguished
US objectives in this area and develop an independent position where the focus should be
put on a civilian force, diplomacy - sometimes preventive - and the prevention of conflicts.

Proposal: Initiate a NATO reform
NATO has gradually given new tasks not included in his Treatise
founder. This pernicious slide took place without consent or democratic control
since these major changes have, for example, never subject to ratification by the
Belgian Parliament. The adoption of NATO's new Strategic Concept in 2010 met the
need to restore the image of the organization in the international arena and to be more effective
Afghanistan. But NATO's failure in this country showed the impasse of the use of force alone
Military and inefficient reconstruction plans.
Furthermore, the assertion of NATO, that the stability and reliability of supplies
energy are of vital importance, raises many questions as to the objectives of
the alliance and its willingness to influence well beyond the borders of Europe. For Ecolo, this passage
a purely defensive alliance to an alliance increasingly offensive must be fought and brought
in check.
For Ecolo, any intervention in the framework of NATO or by one of its members must remain
subject to the UN.
As a founding member and host of the institutions of the European Union and NATO,
Belgium has the legitimacy and capacity (unanimous decision) to play a leading role in
redefinition of NATO doctrine, especially on the nuclear issue.
Finally, NATO's action can take place in compliance with the Charter signed in 1949
establishing a common defense system subject to compliance with the principles of Nations
United. In particular Article 6 stipulates that "the present Treaty does not affect (...) responsibility
primordial Security Council in maintaining peace and international security ".
Ecolo for the European Union as a civilian force should become the main place for decision
politics, always with the approval of the UN Security Council in case of decision
military intervention. In such a configuration, for Eco, a gradual dissolution of
NATO seems possible.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper International Relations - International Chapter - p 11/20

Proposal: Develop a European security policy intégrée12
For Ecolo, it is important to advocate for peaceful, negotiated solutions by
collective diplomacy, preferably European, who would speak with one voice. Trends
NATO towards strengthening the political component and to a military instrument modeled on
US strategy should decrease, while the political role would be to the European Union.
The Belgian Government must therefore primarily defend a proposed Europe as a power
civil. Unlike the situation in the past, military instruments
are more central to national security. The role of civil and political tools
crisis management is gaining in importance. Ecolo supports a "policy
European integrated security "that brings together all the instruments of foreign policy and
Security made available to European states.
Specifically, the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) must tend to strengthen
multilateral cooperation and international institutions such as the United Nations.
The decision-making autonomy from NATO, must be clearly stated and practiced at
against those who hope to see the CSDP evolve in the long term, towards a European political
with defense, above all, a strong military component.
A European defense policy should also enable the realization of economies of scale
in military spending and greater efficiency through specialization of the armed
national (polling and sharing). In this configuration, the Belgian Defence could focus its
Action where their expertise is most useful and already recognized: mine clearance, peace-keeping, rescue
sea, natural disasters, foreign military training.
Disarmament must be one of the fundamental of any security policy key
common. In this sense, Ecolo proposes to introduce binding European standards
to ban direct and indirect exports of heavy and light weapons to regions in crisis.
Until these standards, Belgium must respect the European Code of Conduct and
Federal and regional governments must submit a report to their parliaments
detailed, more complete (final recipient, weapon class by ranking ...) and more frequent in
About granted arms export licenses.
In addition, the European Defence Agency, established in July 2004, should not turn into a
European military industrial complex subject to intense lobbying from the arms industry. he
agrees that the political representatives retain control of the institution and the
technological military instruments it wishes to develop.
Finally, the use of military force as a last resort, should always be a
preliminary impact study, including over existing non-military alternatives. It is necessary
avoided through: a European security and defense becomes a
Reproduction of NATO policy.

Proposal: To fight against nuclear proliferation and disarmament pledge
World Nuclear
For Ecolo, the Federal Government must exert maximum pressure to stop this
arms race become as ruinous as geostrategic without foundation. Belgium
should advise its partners that it no longer wishes to be the host country of nuclear weapons
tactics. The known storage place is the Kleine Brogel military base.
One important event in this context nuclear disarmament will be the next
Conference of the Parties of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 2015. The
Belgium will insist on the implementation of the 64 actions in favor of non-proliferation and
nuclear disarmament of the final declaration of 2010, with particular emphasis on action and
12

For more information on the proposals for Ecolo in European policy, see 'Europe'.

Ecolo program 2014 - Paper International Relations - International Chapter - p 12/20

a common position of the European Union in respect of Article VI of the NPT to the
nuclear disarmament and strengthening the multilateral system of non-proliferation, its
monitoring and evaluation.
Finally, Belgium must support initiatives and negotiations to establish zones
free of nuclear weapons in different parts of the world like the Middle East.

Proposal: Supervise the use of coercive means
For Ecolo, it is appropriate to regulate the use of coercive means and insist on their











the mandate of the UN Security Council;
the prohibition of certain weapons such as weapons of mass destruction
(nuclear or otherwise), chemical weapons, biological weapons, cluster weapons
or landmines, depleted uranium weapons;
the limitation of armaments at the lowest possible level;
the institutionalization of conscientious objection;
democratic control. It exists only in some member states. Ecolo request
therefore its generalization, including in Belgium. National parliaments must issue
assent and, for EU missions, it is the European Parliament.
Specifically, Article 167 of the Constitution should be amended to:
entrust to Parliament any decision on the implementation of the military, in
as part of peacekeeping or peacemaking, a specially qualified majority,
on terms to be determined Parliament will in particular assess the legality of
intervention at the international level, the opportunity of the latter in terms of its objectives and
the presence of a reconstruction plan and transitional post-war organizing. The
Parliament will set the duration after which an extension will be conditioned to a
new parliamentary assent;
allow Parliament to be able to give its prior approval to any
commitment of the armed forces, with the exception of cases where the safety and physical integrity
Belgian and European nationals require emergency intervention, which
involves sending military in extremely short time (24 to 48 hours).
Proposal: Strengthen the arms trade control
Belgium occupies an important place in the international arms trade
conventional. For the period 2008-2012, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute (SIPRI), Belgium occupied the 19th place in the ranking of leading exporters
Belgian weapons and some industries, FN Herstal in Wallonia and Barco in Flanders for example,
Ecolo program 2014 - Paper International Relations - International Chapter - p 13/20 are currently leading position in global markets for certain types of weapons
of associated technologies.
At the Walloon level, the decree "weapons", which reforms the procedure for granting export licenses
weapons, allowed a breakthrough in the field of democratic control and ethics
arms trade by Wallonia. However, there are still to be deepening
in place. Thus, at regional level, it will be:
ensure the establishment of an evaluation of the Decree;
the promotion at EU and international level
prior to production13 ban mechanism;
ensure to set up a system of penalties for non-compliance with clauses
non-resale by the state buyer.
Belgium must also have a strong voice in favor of the treaty rigorous application
on the international arms trade and the extension of its scope to include
in the field of dual-use.
Proposal: To define and frame the cyberarmes14
Technological developments make our planet a set of increasingly complex and
fragile. The science progressing rapidly. This is expressed in particular in the
weapons field. The consequence is that the use of violence with consequences
massive lethal to risks threatening the whole of humanity, is increasingly
diversified.
Specifically, this is for Ecolo define what a cyberarme, develop ways
inventory monitoring of cyber weapons, to introduce voluntary restrictions on elements
their use, their use in refuse first shot, in terms of clear ethical limits
Research and Development regarding potential cyber weapons and develop, in line with
administration and relevant partners, both private and public, the necessary tools to
Research vulnerabilities in the IT infrastructure. These measures should be
encouraged both Belgian and European level.
Proposal: To support the States of the Arab Spring in their march towards the
democracy
Since December 2010, and the immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi15, Tunisia, followed by several States
Maghreb and Middle East, engaged in uprisings demanding democracy and
social justice, crowned by the collapse of several dictators and the implementation process
intended to promote the passage of these states towards pluralistic and democratic regimes. Carrier
many hopes, the Arab Spring has yet entered a critical phase, with discount
involved, sometimes violent, institutions entrusted with these transitions. Armed violence
thus shaken the fragile States when they have not plunged further into the throes of
civil war.
13
Wallonia has included in its decree governing the procedures for granting arms export licenses for
sensitive destinations, a device to ban all production of weapons before granting the license related. This is to
increase on the one hand, the legal and commercial security for the company, which shall incur significant expenditures
in a production which then might not be permitted to export and would be destroyed and, on the other hand,
to prevent the use blackmail to bend the regional authority in relation to a significant destination. For
Ecolo, it would be necessary to advocate a generalization of this system both at the European level.
14
By cyberarme, means computer code used or designed to threaten or cause harm
physical, functional or psychological to structures, systems or living organisms.
15
Young Tunisian street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire December 17, 2010 in Sidi Bouzid. His death is
the origin of riots that sparked the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia and the end of the Ben Ali regime in place since
November 1987.
Ecolo program 2014 - Paper International Relations - International Chapter - p 14/20 It is a long process in which Belgium and the European Union must commit.
After the confession of European impotence in the Syrian conflict, it is imperative that the Union can,
in the light as behind the scenes, play the role expected of it in this slow march
a democratic transition undertaken in this part of the world.
Finally, Belgium and the European Union must support the integration process and
strengthened regional cooperation in North Africa.
For Ecolo:
Beyond the necessary condemnation of violence, mass killings and
confiscation powers exercised by the military, Belgium and Europe must
contribute to all the clarity and this in the most impartial way possible, on
responsibilities in the abuses and violence committed by various parties who
confront, both in Syria than in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya;
Initiatives that work to reconstruction, dialogue and respect for communities
must be actively supported. The first fruits of the negotiation must take place in
respect for pluralism characteristic of the Arab world. It is therefore necessary to
establish a dialogue including representatives of civil society to seek,
with elected officials, the composition and modalities of government able to soothe,
to unify and govern the country;
Belgium and Europe must encourage regional approach in the periphery
Mediterranean, around principles that respect the economic and social autonomy
region. This approach based on cooperation between states bordering the Mediterranean
also requires a close relationship with regional actors such as the African Union
and the Arab League, but also partner with influential neighbors appropriate times and
competitors;
Belgium and Europe must give precedence to human rights and sustainable development
on trade and engage in the signing of economic agreements limiting the impact
and constituting a potential negative external support to social, political,
economic and environmental state of the region. This should give the social progress
means for youth, women and minorities access to education, employment
and the resource base;
The massive mobilization of the peoples of the southern shore of the Mediterranean, including
women and youth, now shows that one of the key partners
the European Union should be civil society. Ecolo advocates the promotion and development
projects between Euro-Mediterranean civil societies by promoting participation
young people and women, both North and South, as inevitable actors
democratization and peace. In this sense, Ecolo gives to dialogue,
education and culture a central role in our external policies.
Proposal: Re-launching the peace process in the Middle East
Lasting peace can only come to the Middle East until the Israeli government remains deaf
the UN resolutions and the recommendations of the EU, continued colonization
occupied territories, and discrimination in its own people by not respecting the
minorities. The US and the European Union must, secondly, ensuring consistency between their
words and actions in relations with the Israeli state.
The recognition in 2012 by the General Assembly of the UN, Palestine as a state
non-member observer is an important step. It notably gives the Palestinians
access to UN agencies and instruments of international treaties such as the International Criminal Court
International. However, this recognition is just one step in conflict resolution
Israel-Palestine.
Ecolo 2014 Program - International Relations Book - Chapter INTERNATIONAL - p 15/20 Ecolo bases its assessment of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on UN resolutions. On the one hand,
Ecolo shares the Palestinian claim, based on international legitimacy, to establish a
Palestinian state on all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967. On the other hand,
should support the right of Israel to exist as a sovereign state.
Finally, Ecolo supports the right of return of Palestinian refugees or just compensation, as
under Resolution 194 of the United Nations.
It should also:
to take initiatives and to demand recall the requirement of unconditional cessation of
settlement colonization in the West Bank (East Jerusalem included) and withdrawal of the army
Israeli. There were 100,000 settlers in the West Bank in 1993; there are more than 350 000 20
years later, to which must be added the 200,000 settlers in East Jerusalem;
to demand the lifting of the blockade of the Gaza Strip;
to ensure the dismantling of the separation wall, in accordance with the opinion of July 9, 2004
International Court of Justice;
to demand an immediate end to rocket attacks and terrorist acts on the part of
Palestinian armed groups;
encouraging the Palestinian state to ratify the Treaty of Rome to allow the Court
International Criminal investigate violations committed on Palestinian territory;
to deploy an international observer force and interposition in the territories
occupied;
to suspend the EU-Israel Association Agreement and to establish an arms embargo
integrating into a generalized embargo to the entire Middle East;
to advocate for Israel's accession to the Treaty on Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT);
to provide a return in the shortest time, with the previous funding method
Temporary International Mechanism of the European Union and the community
International funding for the Palestinian Authority;
to end the impunity of the State of Israel with regard to violations of human rights which it
is guilty towards the Palestinian people and to some of its nationals
to support the request of the Russell Tribunal on Palestine, made to the Criminal Court
International, investigate Israeli crimes;
to seek compensation in the State of Israel for the destruction of infrastructure
financed by the Belgian and European cooperation in the Palestinian territories.
For Ecolo, the Belgian Government must also strengthen the identification of goods from the
colonies through efficient tracing, apply an embargo on these products to meet
EU decision in July 2013, prohibit direct and indirect investments endorsing the
settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and to discourage and penalize all initiatives
(economic, academic or cultural) involved in the colonization of territories
Palestinian. Meanwhile, Ecolo support citizens movements in favor of a boycott on
products from the settlements.
Governments should promote initiatives that promote cooperation, dialogue and
Peace and penalize and discourage all initiatives endorsing colonization Territories
Palestinians, whether economic, academic or cultural.
Finally, in the same direction, according Ecolo, the Federal Government must:
advocate a strict implementation of the roadmap adopted in July 2013 by the EU on
excluding occupied territories of EU-Israel cooperation agreements;
Ecolo program 2014 - Paper International Relations - International Chapter - p 16/20 require the cessation of abuse of administrative detentions perpetrated by the State
Israel on the Palestinians, already condemned repeatedly by the community
international;
demand that Israel respect international law in the treatment of prisoners
Palestinian and stopping the movement of populations, including Bedouins.
The Belgian Government shall also immediately recognize the state of Palestine.
Proposal: To implement the means necessary for lasting peace
in the African Great Lakes Region
The 2011 electoral process, around the presidential and legislative elections, was intended to
consolidate the young Congolese democracy and reconcile the different communities around a
common project. Unfortunately, the multifaceted disorders of the election cycle and the resurgence of
armed violence in the east of the country roughed national unity and made the plunge in Congo
throes of conflicts both political and military. The emergence of armed movements such as
M23, occupying a vast territory in North Kivu, has long demonstrated as weak
Congolese regular army as impotence of UN troops to the UN Mission
stabilization in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO) to stem the armed struggle and
to install a lasting peace. To these were added the armed violence of the looting of resources
areas affected by these conflicts and through foreign powers in benefiting in
must survive a situation where hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons,
facing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in the region. These conflict situations
expose more women, children and young people to multiform violence.
The defeat of the M23, in November 2013, was an important step in the return to peace.
However, many other armed groups continue to plague the Great Lakes region.
In addition, neutralization can not yet give way to justice. The former rebels
are left behind while their former leaders have a regime of impunity
unacceptable.
In this context, Ecolo believes that the Belgian Government should:
undertake a more proactive and ambitious policy for the stabilization of Congo,
exercising firm and objective pressures on the Congolese authorities as well as on
other countries involved in the conflicts;
help train a Congolese army worthy of the name, respectful of the rights
human and especially women still often victims of abuses of power
Congolese regular army and ensure military compensation to avoid
looting;
be proactive in the maintenance of civil peace through mediation
local and regional conflicts. The "field diplomacy" should be strengthened by the creation
Dynamic antennas to the interior of the country, particularly in conflict areas
Eastern countries, to boost the efforts of local initiatives (NGOs, churches,
local governments) regarding restoration of civil peace;
longer term, contribute to ending impunity and arbitrariness and the fight
against the pillaging of natural resources. In general, the Belgian diplomacy
the state should not consider solely in terms of its functioning "administrative"
but also in terms of the requirements of human rights and the fight
against impunity. It is in this sense that should revitalize the arrest warrants
International against warlords who have been the subject of an explicit charge
the International Criminal Court and to prosecute those responsible for abuses, wherever
come;
Ecolo program 2014 - Paper International Relations - International Chapter - p 17/20 work in pursuit and support of the peace process in Burundi and Rwanda to
to create favorable conditions for the political integration of all parties involved
so as to secure the country and improve the living conditions of the Burundians and
Rwandans;
contribute to the implementation of a sustainable development policy in Republic
Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi (notably through political
Belgian Development Cooperation). Indeed, the anarchic exploitation, and often
illegal, the many natural resources of the region and the glaring lack of political
Environmental during the years of instability have caused major damage.
For example, pollution of the River Congo and uncontrolled deforestation in the East
are real disasters that impact on biodiversity but also
Congolese health (hygiene, food ...) and the climate in general (the
Congo forests constituting one of the most important carbon sinks across
planetary). Virunga National Park must be protected from oil exploitation.
ECOLO request that Belgium, like the European Union, strengthens the pressure on
oil companies and the Congolese Government to ensure that protection. There
Belgium must support sustainable recovery programs of natural resources
benefit local populations.
Finally, it comes to supporting electoral processes that will strengthen the foundation of the State
but also the responsibility on local authorities to the people. The government
Congolese must therefore respect the electoral calendar and commit to hold parliamentary elections
but also local and state before the end of 2016. Similarly, Belgium should be ready to
respond to any request for assistance from Burundi, within the 2015 elections,
to enable the country to continue its democratic process.
Proposal: Stay alert to 'forgotten crises'
Many conflicts, crises, human rights violations tend to be forgotten: Sudan
Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Western Sahara, Liberia, Guinea, Burma, Tibet, Sri Lanka,
Mali, Niger, Upper Karabakh, Transnistria, Uighurs, Haiti, Guatemala, Bolivia, Colombia,
Honduras ... not doing, or more, the subject of media hype or attention of policy makers
policies. Lack of strategic interests, concern to maintain good diplomatic relations or
cost of interventions are often at the root of this lack of interest. However, many situations are
alarming and may in turn be a source of instability and conflicts to come, hence the importance
not to marginalize these situations and the people concerned. In these cases, the right
to self-determination and respect for UN mandates are imperative.
It should also recognize and support the vital role of NGOs and society
civil, especially women and youth. In these dozens of conflicts which ignored
main victims are civilians, they remain present and provide assistance to persons
undergoing daily hunger and disease.
PRIORITY 4: FOREIGN POLICY TOWARDS marked, ETHICS AND
RESPONSIBLE
All proposals developed above must be done in the context of a policy
Outdoor renewed and developing an approach based on shared values ​​rather than
on private economic interests. This is for Ecolo, hire Belgium and its components
diplomatic and international in defense of human rights civil, political, economic,
social, cultural and environmental, around equitable economic exchanges, with aid
Increased development and foreign and defense policy based on international law
and the right of populations.
Ecolo program 2014 - Paper International Relations - International Chapter - p 18/20 At regional level, it is important for Ecolo predict outcome indicators and evaluation
sustainable development of regional exports supported both by the Walloon Agency
Export and Foreign Investment (AWEX) by Brussels Invest & Export. It is
also necessary to direct the action of these agencies in the context of support for export and
of investment promotion, to respectful States and human rights clauses
and social and environmental standards or as part of a process to move closer
these standards.
These different objectives and guidance Cooperation belge16 development need
allow for the inclusion of job-environment alliance of logic in the supported projects
partnership with the South, so that they are beneficial to the local population socially and
environ mentally.
Finally, Ecolo, this is to develop close synergies with other embassies
Member States and the Delegations of the European Union, both politically,
operational and administrative (pooling of resources, grouping in one place).

DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION
Consistent cooperation policies and
effective
Status and political horizon
State of play
Since the beginning of this century, with the emergence of a more complex and differentiated world, where
north-south fractures appear to have become increasingly blurred, the main North-South benchmarks have
scrambled. New players have emerged, bringing with them new names among
which "emerging" and "BRICs" 1 are the most used. With these new actors and
with climate crises, economic and social current, new international relationships
undertook, in which the principles and traditional cooperation instruments
development and international organization are less suitable.
Moreover, if, globally, poverty has generally declined over the last twenty
years, inequality, they have not stopped increasing. Growth has primarily benefited
the elites, while a significant portion of the population continues to live below the threshold
poverty (defined as 60% of median income). Extreme poverty also leaves the countryside
to become an urban phenomenon. In countries that have enriched themselves, the possible decline of the extreme
Poverty is to be given to policies and national budgets more than foreign aid.
Debt relief and trade preferences have demonstrated their inability to reduce
inequalities while they have increased tensions and competition between countries or populations already
fragile, both in the exploitation of their resources into mobilizing their
workers.
Political horizon
Development cooperation and its current design must be radically
questioned. What are the objectives of development cooperation in this period
crises and geopolitical focus? The Framework Cooperation Act defines "development
sustainable human "as a general of the Belgian Development Cooperation objective. For Ecolo, the
Belgian cooperation aims to contribute to universal access to fundamental rights, a
better distribution of wealth and improving the quality of life in countries
partners. It must also contribute to the preservation of natural resources and
foster ecosystems. Finally, she has a supporting role in the process of moving towards more
Democracy, in conjunction with local civil society and redistributive and regulatory role of States.
To ensure consistency with other policies, the Belgian cooperation must be coupled with a
reorganization of the international economic and financial governance, even today,
proves to be a destabilizing factor in a forced opening of markets, by
abuse of resources and anti-social and anti-environmental measures.

For Ecolo, it is also appropriate to maintain the specificity of cooperation as a tool for
international solidarity and reducing inequalities. It can not be serving only
Belgian interests subject to the imperatives of foreign policy matters économique.2
Ecolo also advocates that within cooperation programs, local authorities are
recognized as full participants in the development cooperation. Indeed, although
central governments continue to remain key players in the provision of
basic public services, local partners carry significant legitimacy,
by allowing it to promote participatory democracy. They recognize a place as
development actor in this respect, essential. They are, in addition, key players in the
ecological transition.

The Ecolo force lines
Ensure the quality and effectiveness of Belgian cooperation
Strengthen cooperation budgets
Strengthen evaluation and parliamentary scrutiny of cooperation policies and
Policy coherence for development
Reaffirm and strengthen the role of non-state actors and local actors

Priorities and proposals for cooperation with regard to Ecolo
Development
PRIORITY 1: ENSURE THE QUALITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE BELGIAN AND COOPERATION
CONSOLIDATE BUDGETS

Proposal: Ensuring aid the service of populations
The Law on Belgian Development Cooperation adopted in early 2013, is a step forward
in that it provides a framework within which the actors can position and sets
thematic and cross-cutting priorities. As against this law puts too much emphasis on
private investment and openness to international trade, despite a stated objective of
'Sustainable growth'. This approach does not provide the necessary guarantees for a model
development just, sustainable and at the service of the people. For Ecolo, Belgian aid while
as European aid must focus on the needs and essential services for
populations, such as access to food, drinking water, education and health. This
implementation including through maintaining the objective of allocating 15% of public aid
development support to agriculture, prioritizing peasant agriculture and development
implement the principles of agroecology. Assessments using regular short link
periodicity programs. We must therefore strengthen the medium and long term projects which
allow better monitoring and greater efficiency.

Proposal: To reaffirm the federal nature of cooperation
Ecolo reaffirms the federal character of development cooperation to avoid
fragmentation of resources and enhance the effectiveness, harmonization and reduction of costs

2
For more information on the proposed Ecolo regarding international financial architecture, see Chapter
" International ".

ECOLO program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter COOPERATION - Page 2 of 8

Transaction assistance. This approach however is not incompatible with an effort
complementary and coordinated federal entities and local authorities as part of their
respective powers. Thus, decentralized cooperation at local level, initiated by
Environmentalists in the 1999-2003 legislature allowed lasting exchanges between municipalities in the North
and South.

Proposal: Consolidate budgets for development cooperation
The cooperation budget has been severely reduced in 2012 following a freeze on spending,
in fact meant a reduction of EUR 400 million out of a total of two billion. In
2013 the cooperation budget has still suffered successive cuts.
However, EU governments have formally committed to increase development aid to
0.7% of EU GNI in 2015. Belgium had meanwhile pledged to mobilize légalement3
0.7% of its wealth to development aid by 2010. It is clear that the
amounts mobilized since decreased from 0.63% in 2010 to 0.5% in 2013.
give this route mechanism Ecolo proposes to adopt a credible path to reach
this goal. Ecolo means that beyond this national commitment, Belgium pleads with her
European partners and in multilateral forums for the effectiveness of these 0.7%, and for
their upward trend. This amount should not be achieved by the artificial inflation of
aid figures or budgets that, in fact, correspond to any new transfer
resources to developing countries, such as the voluntary repatriation of
asylum seekers or the reception of students from these countries.
To support these financial objectives, Ecolo proposes to establish tariffs
social and environmental at the EU level and affect a large proportion of revenues to
international solidarity. Similarly, Ecolo proposes to levy a contribution on international
airline tickets and use a portion of the profit to finance aid
development.
The number of partner countries of the Belgian Cooperation has been reduced to a maximum of 18. Ecolo
ensure that the choice of partners accordance with criteria established by law, and in particular the
degree of poverty and fragility of the country.
Of these, some become less and less dependent on the flow of cooperation,
while for others these flows are a big part of GDP. Ecolo wants a
concentration of aid on the least developed countries, in which Belgium can bring
using the most effective and useful for people.

Proposal: To ensure effective control of the use of aid
Ecolo wants Belgium leads a more proactive policy towards partner countries in case
participation in a conflict, non-respect for human rights and corruption. This requires a
effective control of the allocation of aid granted, or it is now lacking. For Ecolo
Belgian aid must be subject to strict control, especially in widely corrompus4 country.

2002 Act.
Different instruments, such as reports of Transparency International, help to establish such controls.

ECOLO program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter COOPERATION - Page 3 of 8

PRIORITY 2: STRENGTHEN THE EVALUATION AND CONTROL OF PARLIAMENTARY
POLITICAL COOPERATION AND CONSISTENCY OF POLICIES FOR THE
DEVELOPMENT
For Ecolo, strategic decisions on cooperation should be subject to
parliamentary approval and subject of a public parliamentary debate. Moreover, all
of policies in other sectors should not contradict the objectives
cooperation. They must therefore be analyzed in this direction.

Proposal: To strengthen policy coherence
The achievement of development goals "sustainable human" than door Belgian cooperation
depends not only help, but also to decisions taken by governments
in a large number of sectoral or macro-economic policies such as trade,
agriculture, finance, migration, debt, security, arms sales, law
intellectual, etc. Some political decisions, such as tariff and non tariff barriers, the
agricultural subsidies or the bilateral trade and investment are sometimes
in flagrant contradiction to the objectives of sustainable human development.
The new framework law states in Article 31: "In order to ensure policy coherence
Belgian for development in accordance with Articles 2, 16 °, and 8, are subject to a
screening of their impact on the development of the proposed draft law, the draft decree
Royal and proposed resolutions submitted for the approval of the Council of Ministers ".
This impact analysis should be implemented promptly, consistently and fairly
wide to actually include policies listed above.
Moreover, the law should be amended to end the practice of tied aid, ie
aid conditionality in contracting with Belgian companies. This practice is
unhealthy on principle, and jeopardizes the sovereignty of States and the possibility for actors
private and public to choose independently their economic and trade relations.
Finally, for evaluation and parliamentary control, for Ecolo:
strategic decisions for cooperation should be the subject of a debate
Parliamentary public.
the means and the independence of the special evaluator are essential to its mission
better known and its effectiveness enhanced. Beyond the report to parliament its report
should be circulated more widely.

Proposal: Reforming the institutions in charge of cooperation
The division of roles between the Directorate General for Development (DGD) and Cooperation
Belgian Technical (CTB) needs to be clarified, on pain of loss of efficiency and confusion. It is
regrettable that the government has taken so long to renew BTC management contract and, in
therefore, has left the institution in the fog for more than two years.
A new management contract must assign to BTC operational missions in countries
partners and leave the strategic aspects of cooperation in the DGD.

ECOLO program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter COOPERATION - Page 4 of 8

Proposal: Reforming the Belgian Investment Company for Countries
Development (BIO)
Ecolo considers that the aid for private investment can have a positive role in cooperation
Development so far as the choice of supported initiatives is consistent with the fight against
poverty and inequality.
Now widely criticized for BIO5 practices are unsustainable and not consistent with the
objectives and principles of Belgian cooperation.
For Ecolo, the new management contract between BIO and the Belgian State must provide:
strict consistency with the objectives and principles of the framework law on cooperation;
a concentration of investments in small and micro businesses in assisted countries and in
priority areas of cooperation;
a withdrawal of investments in projects that do not correspond to
relevance, such as breach of the principles of decent work or not
compliance with environmental criteria;
withdrawal of tax havens and offshore centers and the use of public banks
development.

PRIORITY 3: REAFFIRM AND STRENGTHEN THE ROLE OF NON PLAYERS
GOVERNMENT
The recently amended law provides the mechanisms for recognition of cooperation actors
indirect subsidies and activation mode. Ecolo supports the role of non-actors
governmental (NGOs, trade unions, mutual ...) in cooperation since, by
field work, it is the vector of active citizenship and a stimulus for the creation of a
civil society in partner countries. It is important to guarantee their autonomy. The role of these
players in development education in Belgium is also crucial.
Ecolo also considered crucial global networking dynamics
civil society, national and international advocacy, mobilization campaigns in Belgium
in the North, development education and global citizenship and work
research to uncover the mechanisms that contribute to the North intolerable situations
in the south.

Proposal: To ensure the autonomy of indirect bilateral cooperation
The Belgian indirect cooperation is characterized by a variety of actors: the side of NGOs,
universities, local authorities, trade unions, scientific institutions and associations
Specialized receive public subsidies to carry out cooperation programs
development. Each actor must be able to act according to its specific nature and vocation
clean. Autonomy and diversity are indeed advantages of indirect aid in complementarity
programs.
Efforts should nevertheless be made to further strengthen the relevance, quality,
efficiency and complementarity of such programs, so they resolutely part of a
common and coherent sustainable development perspective. Instead of forcing players
indirect to align the focal sectors and countries of direct bilateral cooperation,

BIO is the Belgian Investment Company for Developing Countries. Its mission is to promote the development
establishment of a strong private sector in developing and emerging countries.

ECOLO program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter COOPERATION - Page 5 of 8

should be put in place practices that improve coordination and information exchange
between actors direct and indirect cooperation (points of contact and mechanisms
consultation, for example).
Belgium must also put pressure at European level to this new approach
is considered one of the challenges of reform and aid effectiveness, and that the local level
become a priority area of ​​cooperation. Furthermore, Ecolo intends to promote, in
Belgian communal, new forms of decentralized cooperation in partnerships
concrete and practical with Southern local authorities.

Proposal: Strengthen support for women.6
Women's rights are violated in different parts of the world. Thus, women are
more exposed than men to poverty and precariousness. Many of them suffer
unspeakable moral and physical violence, ranging from contraception forced by their employer,
Rape as a weapon of guerre7. They are too often excluded from certain processes
democratic, access to education, do not enjoy the fundamental rights and freedoms.
They play a vital role in economic operation, social and democratic development of our
societies and in the South. Their participation in decision-making processes and inclusion
in economic and social development of the regions from which they come must be
guaranteed.
Despite numerous declarations of intent gender equality being a dimension
must-political human development, there is a marked tendency to
dilution of the principle of gender equality in development cooperation policies.
As stated by the contribution "Women's Consultation on Financing for Development", the
Women in developing countries work primarily in the informal sector and in good standing
General, for very low wages - when they are paid - even as
social safety nets and protection of the poor are absent or inadequate.
In this context, Ecolo intends to make mainstreaming of gender equality in the
Belgian cooperation policy one of its priorities. An important step is to ensure that at
least half of the additional resources devoted to development aid in
coming years is a real relevance and impact on gender equality. In the same
optical, it will integrate within cooperation policies, means of verification
suitable to measure the effective and mainstreaming of gender equality in particular by the
systematization of gender-specific impact indicators and qualitative indicators
programs and projects funded by cooperation.
On the other hand, face the many conservative currents that threaten women's rights
to decide their sexual and reproductive lives, it should pay particular attention to
financing of programs to strengthen partner countries sex education,
access to information, effective contraception for all and the right of
women to control their bodies.
Moreover, the role of women in agriculture, especially to ensure the survival of their
family, is essential in the South and should be enhanced.
Finally, Belgium must additionally provide specific support and strengthened the ratification and
implementation of the Protocol on Women's Rights, adopted by the African Union, which marks a
remarkable progress in women's rights recognition and alignment
international goals.

Proposal: Strengthen support for academic cooperation
Cooperation between Western universities and the South is fundamental in terms of
Strengthening partner countries development capabilities, for most LDCs (countries
least developed) and in terms of scientific cooperation between Belgium and countries outside Europe. Whether scholarships for students, support to infrastructure
academics, research projects jointly or teacher exchanges, all these
programs aim to support developing countries in the challenges of resource
based and democratic governance. These measures must also allow countries
North to better understand the realities of the South.
Support for joint international research programs and projects (through UNESCO, UNEP,
and EC in particular), or as part of bilateral cooperation, and strengthens, the
long term capacity and scientific cooperation and is a means to meet
Belgian commitments made at international level (in terms of development cooperation, the
education, biodiversity and climate change among others).
For Ecolo, the Federal Government must release the funds available and coordinate
activities in this area, which must be continued and intensified.

Proposal: To facilitate the integration of members of the diasporas living in
Belgium in development cooperation programs
The amounts transferred by members of diasporas to their countries of origin exceed
amounts of development cooperation. This fact is partly due to a lack of
confidence in development cooperation programs developed by States (help
inadequate, lack of monitoring ...). The integration in the discussions and in the monitoring process
Community members could restore confidence and improve the quality of cooperation.

MIGRATION and ASYLUM
A society respectful of human rights,
intercultural solidarity
"People migrate today for the same reasons that prompted tens of
millions of Europeans once left your shores. They flee war or oppression, or
in search of a better life in a new land. Those forced
to leave their homes - the refugees who flee in search of safety - under our
collective responsibility legally and morally. (...)
Immigrants are part of the solution, not part of the problem. They must not
become scapegoats for various ailments of our society (...) "
Koffi Annan, former UN Secretary-General.

Status and political horizon
State of play in Belgium
Since the late 70s and the accentuation of the crisis in 2008, the return to stability
economic and social remains difficult. It is in this context that asylum seekers and more
largely foreign, have become the scapegoats ideals of a society in crisis. Consequently
there, one is faced with a rise in xenophobia and isolationism. Political discourse
dominant, a "Belgium faces an uncontrollable and uncontrolled influx of applicants
asylum, illustrated by a reception crisis "has had negative consequences on the policy
asylum and migration.
The saturation of the reception network resulted more from a change in the asylum procedure
a real influx of Refugees1. Indeed, before the reform of the asylum procedure in 2006 and the law
home in 2007, the regulation meant that people remained less time
in the accueil2 centers. The modification of the procedure and the law on the reception whose effect
to provide for the accommodation of asylum seekers in host structure throughout the procedure,
including during any appeals, it was foreseeable that the reception network congestion would
soon take place, especially as several reception centers were closed in 2006.
The campaign against asylum seekers and foreigners in general had an effect
devastating because of the restriction on the maximum the rights of foreigners and asylum
asylum and the priority placed on the voluntary return and forced. These policies show
particularly by:

Article of the League of Human Rights Law and the Service of Youth: http://www.liguedh.be/2010/1024-politiquedasile-en-belgique--une-opinion-publique-manipulee

The asylum procedure was divided into two stages: the examination of the admissibility of the asylum application and the merits of
thereof. When the application was declared admissible, the applicant was entitled to leave the center to live so
autonomous with financial assistance from a CPAS. Since the reform of the asylum procedure and reception (2006-2007), the
distinction between the two phases of the asylum procedure was abolished and the applicant's accommodation is held in structure
Home throughout the proceedings, including during any appeals. Therefore, asylum seekers have
no choice but to stay in a reception center for a much longer period.

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter ASYLUM AND MIGRATION - p 1/22

A limitation of access to the asylum procedure through the list of qualified countries "countries
safe "and the tightening of conditions for introducing multiple requests (2nd, 3rd
request …) ;
A restriction or suppression of the right to social assistance to certain categories of
people ;
A hardening of the right to family reunification;
A reform of the procurement process and award of Belgian nationality which makes
much more difficult to access;
Inhuman treatment of requests for medical regularization;
Rare and humanitarian arbitrary adjustments;
An increase in the budget foreseen for expulsions3.

In the European Union
Since 2000, the European Union is characterized by extremely migration policy
safe.
Thus we witnessed everywhere in the EU and in the neighboring countries
- Under the pressure of the latter - to the creation and expansion of detention centers for
illegal immigrants, increased deportation orders, restrictions in
the granting of asylum, to the establishment of an increased police cooperation at European level
(Schengen, SIS systems, VIS, EURODAC, FRONTEX, adopting a "Return Directive").
This very tough policy for unwanted migrants is subject to a migration policy
welcoming to migrants 'chosen', materialized by the Directive 'blue card' 4.
From one point of view of its objectives, the EU policy is a failure because it did not result in
reduction of migratory flows, on the contrary, it strengthens illegal immigration and the influence of
networks of trafficking in human beings. It leads to too many disasters in terms of
sacrifiées5 human lives and the news reminds us cruelly with shipwrecks
boat migrants. If the exact number is unknown, the number of deaths in the Mediterranean between
1989 and 2013 is estimated at no less than 19,000 people.
On the occasion of the interception of migrants at the borders of Europe, human rights violations
humans are regularly made. The European Court of Human Rights has
condemned Italy February 23, 2011 for intercepting migrants and asylum seekers
African high seas and to have handed over to Libyan authorities Khadafi6.

The Ecolo political horizon: a society respectful of human rights,
intercultural solidarity
Ecolo will, in synergy with environmentalists in other Member States of the EU and Parliament
European, national and other European migration policy.
At European level, Ecolo supports the development of a migration policy and asylum
Common harmonizing national legislation upwards in terms of humanity and dignity

Under the government Di Rupo, the budget for deportations increased from 6.695 million to € (2010) to € 8.07 million in 2012.
Secure flight evictions are indeed becoming more frequent, or they are very expensive.

Directive "blue card" refers to highly skilled workers. The aim is to facilitate the arrival in the EU brain

Efforts made or to be made, or dialogues for compensation provided for countries that lose their original

human, taking as reference the standards and practices of the most protective rights
Migrants and asylum seekers.
Ecolo denounced the actions of European institutions such as practicing Frontex7
regularly refoulement of refugees to countries where their safety and their lives are threatened
as well as the readmission agreements concluded by Belgium, the Benelux or the European Union and
States that regularly violate human rights.
Ecolo considers that Europe must address migration issues from an approach that:
provides active solidarity between North and South and between West and East, as well as
consolidation of fundamental and social rights of individuals;
so this logic where almost everything circulates in this globalized world - capital,
information, certain goods and services, international frameworks, except humans
becoming the only exception to the principle of "free trade" generalized.
Ecolo requested that the issue of free movement of persons to be considered in the same way
as that relating to freedom of movement of goods.
Furthermore, Ecolo insists that immigration chosen by a country exclusively
according to its own economic needs is another form of looting of countries to
development.
In Belgium, the populist and xenophobic discourse against foreigners, opposes Ecolo
alternatives to existing law and practice. Studies in France and Belgium
the economic effects of immigration invite to a clearly positive attitude towards
immigration. A study on the effect of regularization of undocumented migrants in Belgium revealed that
the impact of immigration on GDP per capita on public finances is rather beneficial.
Immigration increases the income of the entire population locale8. In France, a study more
the precise effect of immigration considers the contribution of immigrants to a dozen billion € by
year.9.
In this context,

force lines of Ecolo project are:

Decriminalize migration policy
Encouraging mobility of migrants
Improving the quality of the asylum procedure
Improving living procedures and remedies
Improve the reception of foreigners and emergency medical assistance to persons in
Irregular
Relax the conditions for granting Belgian nationality

Priorities and proposals for Ecolo
PRIORITY 1: decriminalize MIGRATION POLICY
"The current migration, whether economic or political, are the first
Accordingly World disorders, inequalities, lack of justice and democracy
the world. "10
The EU must recognize its share of responsibility for these imbalances and reorient its policies
to reduce inequalities. Consequently, it must adjust its trade policies,
international and coopération11 order to truly contribute to developing countries
of origin of migrants. The EU must also be recognized as a land of asylum and reception of these
migrants12 and stop making cooperation blackmail: in particular it must stop imposing
readmission conditions of the southern country nationals within the framework of agreements
economic partnership. Within the EU, Belgium must work in this direction.

Proposal: To ensure respect for the rights of migrants at borders
External EU
Frontex, the European agency for external border controls of the Union, with a real
military arsenal (helicopters, boats, etc.), conducts a war migrants. She
coordinates actions between the police of the Member States and lends decisive help
terms of logistics and training to intercept migrants attempting to enter
within the borders of the Union. On the occasion of these interceptions at sea and borders
land, many human rights violations are committed. Indeed, migrants are
repressed, without having the opportunity to seek asylum, to countries where human rights are
are not always respected. Frontex has considerable freedom of action without a real
is exercised on its activities.
Ecolo joined the claims of the campaign "Frontexit" 13 for the respect of human rights
migrants at the external borders of the European Union and asks:
transparency on the mandates, responsibilities and actions of Frontex;
the suspension of the agency's activities identified as contrary to human rights;
the cancellation of the regulation establishing the Frontex Agency, if it is shown that the mandate of
the agency is incompatible with the respect for fundamental rights.
In this sense, as developed below, Ecolo is resolutely in favor of a European policy
positive visa to the mobility of migrants and a policy to ensure compliance with the law
asylum, unlike the discharge policy today.

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter ASYLUM AND MIGRATION - p 4/22

Proposal: Operate control over Frontex and denounce agreements
readmission
Belgium must ensure regular monitoring of Frontex activities. The Minister of the Interior and
State Secretary to the asylum and migration policy are accountable to Parliament
conducted by Frontex operations which Belgium participates.
Furthermore, Ecolo opposes what Belgium negotiated and concluded readmission agreements
illegal immigrants, without worrying about the often disastrous consequences
terms of human rights. Some of these agreements provide for the delivery of these migrants to
countries where their basic rights are not always guaranteed. For example, the agreement
readmission agreement between Benelux and Kosovo is likely to facilitate the expulsion of members
minorities - including Roma - persecuted and deprived of rights in Kosovo14.

Proposal: To decriminalize illegal residence
Illegal residence is a criminal offense in Belgium. However, decisions of the European Court of
Human Rights or the European Union Court of Justice to invite the decriminalization
illégal15 stay. Ecolo therefore proposes to remove from the law the criminal offense that is the
illegal stay.
Furthermore, encourages Ecolo Belgium, in its relations with its partners, including
Algeria and Morocco, to advocate for the decriminalization of illegal immigration. Moroccans,
of Tunisiens16 and Algerians were detained in their countries to attempt irregular output
the territory. There is a priori no case law or showing incarceration reports
return, but the fact that the Moroccan, Tunisian and Algerian laws provide for this penalty,
justifies the fear of such migrants to be incarcerated to return.
However, the criminalization of illegal immigration violates international law and European law
(Protocol 4 to the European Convention on Human Rights - ECHR). Consequently, Ecolo
asks the EU not to support such violations as has been the case many times.
This penalty has been adopted by Algeria and Morocco under EU pressure, it is quite
possible for the EU to back down, especially when the great announcement Morocco
reform its migration policy.

Proposal: Delete the closed centers
The closed centers have not always existed. They were designed in the 90s under the
Interior Minister Vande Lanotte. Since then they have become a key component of policies
safe.
These centers have no place in a democracy worthy of the name. They equate to some
criminals and seriously undermine individual freedom of people without
necessarily committed a crime or offense and do not pose a risk to public order,
solely because of their administrative status. Ecolo calls for the total elimination of these
centers and supports any approach along the lines of banning measures
confinement:
non-detention of asylum seekers in detention centers;

not holding sick people.
Official and independent studies have also demonstrated the cost of such
policy, and especially the fact that the extension of detention has no impact on rates of
return that remain substantially the same order, that detention be held for ten days or
for months.
It can therefore be concluded that the tendency to extend the holding period reflects the will
discourage potential immigrants and reassure a worried electorate.
The duration of such detentions is particularly problematic because the investments in closed centers
may be extended and last for five months or longer in some circumstances. Ecolo offers,
failing to obtain the closure of detention centers, limit to one month the period of detention
in these centers. This period may be extended only once for a period of fifteen
days if the Immigration Department can demonstrate having undertaken with due diligence, of
steps to give effect to the expulsion. The decision to extend the
custody should automatically be subject to review by the Council Chamber
competent, to monitor the removal conditions are actually met.

Proposal: Restricting the conditions under which one may be issued
decision to ban entry
Currently, a person receiving an order to leave the territory (OQT) may also
receive an entry ban decision on Belgian territory of three or five years if
fraud or breach of public order.
A foreigner who receives a OQT and returns to his home country will make it more
temporary stays in Belgium, in the framework of visa, to visit family and friends. This
interference in private and family life of foreigners is unjustifiable.
The duration of the entry ban is often maximized, even though the Agency
foreigners must consider the circumstances of each foreign (family life, perspectives
professional ...). Only an annulment is possible against such decisions.
Ecolo proposes to delete the possibility for the Belgian authorities to issue such a ban
input, except in cases of serious breaches of public order. Ecolo wishes to impose a requirement of
enhanced motivation with regard to these decisions. In this context, the alien must be able to be heard
by the Aliens Office in the presence, if desired, his lawyer to argue the elements
relating to his private life, family, professional or social.

PRIORITY 2: PROMOTE THE MOBILITY OF MIGRANTS
Proposal: To facilitate the access of non-EU foreign students
Access to non-European foreign students studying in our country is from
long been an important form of development aid. It is a policy of openness and also
cultural exchange for Belgian students attending the same audiences.
It is important to improve the equivalence of devices diplomas of foreign students, aiming
including better information and greater efficiency of the administrative department responsible
these equivalences.
Furthermore, Ecolo wishes to implement strategies to encourage foreign students
to put their knowledge and experience for the benefit of development of their countries of origin.
Foreigners who studied in Belgium should be granted a legal status enabling them to be

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter ASYLUM AND MIGRATION - p 6/22

back regularly. This would maintain a strong link between the country of study and country
of origin and to encourage real exchange of knowledge, information and expériences17.

Proposal: Rethinking the visa policy on the free movement of
Human being
The visa should be conditioned only to the verification of the non-dangerous
the applicant to public order or national security.
Such flexibility visa matters can help to stop an effect
paradox of too rigid policy: incentives to clandestine, deterrence return in the
country, building sectors. Just know the obtaining of a difficultés18
Visa for access to a European country to understand that many of those who have obtained stay there
after the expiry of the visa, for fear of not being able revenir19.
Many artists, professionals, businessmen, NGO staff, lived experience
miss the exhibition, meeting, conference, meeting at which they were involved, r
because of the refusal to grant a visa, the reasons for this refusal are generally obscure.
Freedom of movement would become the rule and restriction the exception.

Proposal: End the discharge decisions at the entrance
on the territory
Upon arrival in Belgium, persons may be denied entry
Belgium, while they have a perfectly valid travel document (visa ...). The law
grants to the authorities responsible for border control great power to review
conditions of entry to the territory. This sometimes leads to arbitrary decisions, where people
arrived lawfully in the territory and have proven their intention to leave the territory at the end of
their stay is denied entry and are held to be repressed.
Consequently, Ecolo proposes that without serious risk of seriously undermining public order,
entry to the territory is still permitted for people with documents and a title
valid travel.

Proposal: Protecting the rights of migrants, the interests of countries of origin,
and those of the host society
The existants20 migration patterns are generally utilitarian, with almost exclusive benefit of
country that opens its doors. Thus, these States practice a selective management of immigration:

17

Experience shows that many foreign students do not return to their countries of origin once their
graduation, due to the loss of their right of residence in Belgium, so difficult to recover.
18
Short stay visa applicants are faced with queues, with incomprehensible refusal, the arbitrariness
more complete, and the lack of effective remedies.

Mehdi Lahlou, an economics professor at the National Institute of Statistics and Applied Economics (INSEA) of the University of
Rabat, and expert on issues related to migration and development, explains that "the visa generalization in
the host country has added to the attractiveness of Europe the feeling that she would become "prohibited" (...) greatly
contributed to the growth of movements in hiding, and was able to transform human movement
that occurred in both directions, ultimately securing in some European countries for fear of not being able to
come back ". Mehdi Lahlou, irregular migration between the Maghreb and the European Union: recent developments Project

In the US, the most frequent work visa ("H1-B Visa") is issued to holders of a diploma
university or comparable qualifications. There are also special visas for less skilled workers or
some professions (agricultural workers, teachers ...). In Canada, next to temporary migration in relation to a license
temporary work regarding 90,000 people who enter the country each year, there is a possibility
permanent migration whose selection is by a point system. Specifically, the more likely

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter ASYLUM AND MIGRATION - p 7/22

"Brains" or immigrants with a particular specific professional qualification are
welcome in the host country.
In general, the migration phenomenon is perceived by Eco as positive, including a
socially, culturally, economically and environmentally. This does not prevent it poses
substantive issues of sustainable and just solutions must be made.
Different interests must be formed:
the interest of the State from which the migrants, particularly in the least developed countries
Advanced: agreements between the EU and countries of origin as well as regulations
Europe could set standards to determine the conditions, criteria,
limitations and establish a possible system of fair compensation for the country
of origin; limiting the "brain drain" is legitimate and even desirable;
the interest of the migrants on the one hand, may want a better life but who else
hand, are often exploited because the call for foreign labor also concerns
Migrants few or no qualifications for jobs whose apparent workforce shortages sometimes mask the poor working conditions;
the economic, social and cultural development of migrants' destination company; before
shout too quickly to the labor shortage, it is necessary to provide an obligation to
union consultation to check whether sufficient efforts have been made to improve
working conditions and salaries and to fight against discrimination in hiring.
Currently, the European Union develops the concept of "circular migration" should
facilitate the movement of third country nationals between these countries and the European Union. These
devices would reduce labor shortages in the EU to stem the phenomenon
illegal immigration and benefit the countries of origin of the positive impact of
emigration. If the concept is attractive, the "circular migration" ultimately affects a
very limited number of individuals. However, the "circular migration" tends to value the rights
economic at the expense of individual and social rights: the "circular migrant" can have
decent family and private life, he lives between two or more countries without installer21. There
"Circular migration" appears more as a system based on non-installation
migrant.
For Ecolo, one must be cautious about this new concept. Indeed, we find that the Agreements
mobility may ultimately increase the deregulation of labor, since the migration would
dependent on the value that the migrant could bring to the company. In this context, the rights
individual and social appear less priority.
International conventions should also be ratified such as the Convention
International UN on Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and
members of their famille22 and integrated into national laws, as well as the conventions
the International Labour Organization, particularly Convention 143 and 97.
Finally, it is urgent to heed the call of the WHO and to integrate the principles of the Global Code of Practice
the international recruitment of health personnel, particularly in order to avoid leakage - via our
Foreigners who have an economically interesting profile: Immigrant commercial (investor, entrepreneur, or
Independent, which must in all cases provide evidence of a thorough knowledge and experience in the
field of business and invest some money in Canada) and the "skilled worker" (which combines
skills-based training, experience, knowledge of French or English, the adaptability and
other factors). In Australia, while legislation provides for three main currents of immigration - the arrival of
qualified and / or experienced professional, family reunification, humanitarian immigration -
the arrival of skilled people is a priority since 1997. In 2006, about 130,000 visas available, 97,500 visas were
intended for skilled immigration.

PRIORITY 3: IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE ASYLUM PROCEDURE
Proposal: Delete the so-called list of "safe countries"
A list of countries considered, often wrongly, as safe, was established in 2012. Nationals
these countries are presumed to have no real fears if returned. Their procedure is soon
when accelerated, the burden of proof is heavier and the use of litigation Council
Foreigners is open to them in case of refusal decision does not suspend the order to leave the
territory. There is no list of these countries at European level.
Currently the countries considered safe by the Belgian authorities are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia and India. Or, by way of examples,
the home of the 140 Kosovars in 2011 because of persecution or the presence of European forces
- Including Belgium - in the Balkans show that these countries are still fragile and experiencing
significant ethnic tensions.
This list of countries was drawn up on the basis of reports - not public - established by the Commissioner
General for Refugees and Stateless Persons, and then submitted to the FPS Foreign Affairs never
have been presented and discussed in the federal Parliament.
This list was then imposed on the CGRA by the Government and the Secretary of State for Asylum and
migration, despite many international reports that reflect the fact that most of
these countries are not stable. The most telling example is Kosovo, where Belgian troops
present ... to stabilize that country and to contain ethnic tensions still real.
Ecolo is for the complete abolition of the principle of safe country list in the legislation.
Pending this deletion, transparency in the development of these by the CGRA
reports must be put through a parliamentary debate on their content and publication
the website of the CGRS.

Proposal: Reforming the system thoroughly Dublin II
In June 2013, the European Parliament adopted the new Asylum package that includes Eurodac, the
Dublin II Regulation, the Procedures Directive and the Directive on reception conditions
refugees.
Ecolo regrets that the general architecture of the system, fundamentally unfair to the
Asylum seekers and the Member States on the borders of the Union, is maintained. The
Regulation "Dublin II" imposes criteria that determine which Member State is responsible for
examining the asylum application, regardless of problematic consequences this may
lead. This system is unfair, costly and inefficient. In fact, it causes the separation
families (it is considered that the relationship between spouses or parents and children), results
random or problems in obtaining protection, and is based on the misconception
which all Member States of the European Union meet in the same manner the rights
of asylum seekers. While Greece is the glaring example of the failure of Regulation
Dublin II, it remains the central pillar of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). While this vote
June 2013 has allowed some progress, particularly with regard to procedural guarantees,
thereof remain low.

23

Ecolo has filed a motion for a resolution in the sense Doc. 53 0511/001.

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter ASYLUM AND MIGRATION - p 9/22

Ecolo is particularly concerned about Article 28 on "Detention for the purpose of
transfer ". If text states that a person can not be placed in detention simply because
it is the subject of a procedure Dublin, retention would still be possible in the case of "no risk
negligible leakage ". In practice, this risk is left to the discretion of Member States. Of
Similarly, no binding mechanism transfers are planned.
The problems these questions in the field call the Belgian authorities and the EU to get
more concerned. As part of their efforts, asylum seekers should have
a worthy and acceptable treatment.
Ecolo wants a thorough review of the Dublin II Regulation in order to allow
freedom of choice of the host country by the asylum seeker and the establishment of a solidarity
financial and logistical between European states, based on the number of asylum seekers
welcomed.
Until this reform takes place, Ecolo calls for greater transparency of the Agency
foreign (OE) when determining the State responsible for processing the application
Asylum: The applicant should be notified of renewed request by the OE to the European State
he considers responsible for the examination of the application.

Proposal: Improving the rights of defense and guarantee
fairness of the procedure
Ecolo proposes the adoption of a regulation that enhances the rights of the defense
asylum seekers and gives them a fair trial.
These regulations must provide:
the assistance of a lawyer at all stages of the proceedings to the Office of foreigners and the
CGRA, including when it comes to determining the State responsible for examining an
asylum (based on the Dublin II Regulation) and to examine the consideration
a new application for asylum;
to adapt the questionnaire called "Dublin" to specifically request to seekers
asylum if they have proof of the elements they claim;
access to the administrative file to the claimant and his lawyer before the CGRA
makes its decision;
access to information from the CGRS Documentation Centre (the Cedoca) for
asylum seeker and his lawyer;
special attention to the vulnerable: children, women, people
disabilities, trauma, etc. ;
training of staff of the CGRA and the Aliens Office on intercultural and
need to develop intercultural reflections, ethno-psychological and
anthropological in the management of the hearings of asylum seekers. This dimension
sorely lacking today;
maintaining family unity: refugee status should be accorded to members of the
refugee family with whom he forms a family unit, even if the family members
does not qualify to be recognized on an individual basis (Art.23
Qualification Directive);
to give effect to the principle that the burden of proof is shared between the
asylum seeker and the CGRA and that doubt must be given to the claimant if the
task of establishing the relevant facts must be conducted jointly by the applicant and
the examiner, doubt must benefit the applicant. The reasons for the decision will
allow to know why, if any, doubt has not benefited to the applicant;

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter ASYLUM AND MIGRATION - p 10/22

the obligation for the General Commission to justify why it considers
a document issued by a foreign authority can not be considered
or is a fake;
recognition of the principle that the applicant's nationality is proven by its
passport until proven guilty;
the obligation for the asylum authorities to take into consideration the content of certificates
medical and psychological reports submitted at least question their
Content by another medical-psychological report;
the development of a real psychological cell to the CGRS could hear
asylum seekers with psychological problems. The team, based at the CGRA but
independent,
would
Multidisciplinary
(including
of
ethno-psychologists,
anthropologists, experts in interculturalism, etc.) and would be available on request
CGRA officials, but also upon request of the claimant or his counsel;
recording of the hearings to the CGRA and the Aliens Office.
Furthermore, Ecolo offers:
monitoring and support to the CGRA protection officers dealing with asylum applications
given the confrontation of these to life stories of exile and sometimes very
challenging;
a human resources management policy CGRA which takes account of the
difficulty of the protection officer function: preventive measures to
avoid situations of burn out or motivation, the ability to vary the tasks
work, performing various formations, etc. ;
to return the asylum seeker to the CGRA concerns of central and
processing of asylum applications. Too often asylum seekers are reduced to a
number, a number to be processed by the CGRS at the expense of quality-instruction and
Therefore the risk of refoulement unfairly dismissed refugee.

Proposal: To enable better treatment of requests
Multiple asylum
Since September 2013, when an applicant introduced a second, third or
fourth asylum application, that is to say, a multiple asylum application, a filter is operated by the
CGRA. The latter, based on a questionnaire completed at the Immigration Office after a first
Hearing of the applicant, assesses whether new information presented appear
significantly increasing the likelihood that the applicant can claim the
recognition of refugee status or subsidiary protection.
The applicant has no opportunity to explain what could be considered as
contradictions or non-credible evidence. Only a judicial review takes place before the Council
Aliens Litigation, in the context of an action for annulment. This remedy is not
suspensive.
This new provision of the law is the application of a European directive 2005/85 / EC.
Nevertheless, for Ecolo, the amendment of the law goes too far in terms of asylum applications
multiple. If, according to the Minister for Immigration and Asylum, only 3.5% of asylum applications
many can lead to recognition of refugee status or subsidiary protection, it
should continue to protect the rights of the defense of asylum seekers in the framework of these
applications. This is especially necessary for seconds asylum for
which the applicant has had the opportunity to obtain new documents of his country and
and to overcome the shortcomings raised in its first demand. These deficiencies are often due
by ignorance of asylum seekers on the need for evidence to be

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter ASYLUM AND MIGRATION - p 11/22

substantiate their fear. Several weeks or months are sometimes required in order to bring these
documents.
Consequently, Ecolo proposes to remove the filter operated by the CGRS, as regards seconds
asylum applications.
Regarding subsequent applications, Ecolo suggests that the filter be exercised by the CGRS of relaxed
so that only the records for which there is clearly no evidence
to make a decision different from that taken previously will be eligible
a refusal to consideration by the CGRA.

Proposal: Strengthen requirements reasons for decisions
made by the asylum authorities
Besides the proposals for improving the rights of the defense of asylum seekers and
to ensure a fair trial (see above), Ecolo also formulates requirements
motivation of decisions by the asylum authorities.
For Ecolo, any decision on asylum should always decide on
following:
The risk if returned to the country in which the asylum seeker's nationality or, in the case
statelessness in the country of habitual residence;
The subjective element (fear) and the objective element (the country's situation) surrounding the
fear of persecution of the applicant for asylum;
The general situation in terms of security of the country of the claimant (a country
War can be a sufficient basis to grant subsidiary protection status
without the need for the applicant to establish individually the risk
of serious harm);
The consideration of the child's interest when it comes to families with children as well
the situation of women in countries where their human and socio-economic rights
are notoriously violated;
The reasons why the words of the asylum seeker have not been found
sufficiently credible and spontaneous;
The reasons why it is not given the information provided by the applicant
asylum on the general situation in his country and who report
persecutions similar to those suffered by the claimant.

Proposal: Establish systematic missions in the country
composed of independent experts
It is important that information on countries of origin are collected in the most way
impartial as possible, so that the CGRS base its decisions on objective data. However, for
some countries, it seems that this is not the case. Indeed, to date the CGRA leads himself
missions to these countries to establish relations based on which it will then take its decisions.
The CGRS is judge and jury.
For example, some of the conclusions of the 2011 report on Guinea, from mission
conducted by the CGRS in this country are in conflict with other important sources,
official sources: the CGRA mission report states that there is more risk in terms
genital mutilation in Guinea, while the Guinean Ministry of Health simultaneously fate

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter ASYLUM AND MIGRATION - p 12/22

a plan of action against FGM, estimating the risk élevé24 yet. A second example concerns the
report prepared by the CGRA which led to the conclusion that Kosovo is a safe country: it
report does not take into account for example the statements of the Ombudsman explains that
minorities are persecuted and that the government does not give away its
recommandations25.
Therefore, it is important that independent missions (eg composed of researchers
academics, independent asylum instances) are organized in certain sensitive countries,
so that an objective report could inform the analysis treating agents of the CGRS.

Proposal: Provide in legislation a CGRA control of the House of
Representatives
The Commissioner General for Refugees and Stateless Persons (CGRS) is an administrative authority
which enjoys an independent decision-making autonomy or refuse to recognize quality
refugee and to grant subsidiary protection status. The CGRS is currently the
single asylum instance has a real skill instruction.
The only current control CGRS decisions is by way of appeal to the Council
Aliens Litigation (CCE). Parliament is, in turn, informed of activities
CGRA than the simple transmission of the report to him annually the Commissioner-General.
Ecolo wants complete control of the CGRA, offering the opportunity for Parliament to exercise
adequate consideration of the CGRA activities without undermining the essential
independence that it has to make decisions and control exercised by the Council
Contentious foreign (CEC). The loi26 tabled by Ecolo wants to introduce
Faculty for the House of Representatives and the Senate, after each annual report of the CGRA,
to question the Commissioner-General for Refugees and Stateless Persons on the content of his report
as well as other general appearance of the positions, opinions, activities and functioning of the CGRA.

Proposal: Give permission to stay and an appeal to all suspensive
asylum seekers
Currently all asylum seekers do not enjoy this right, those who are the subject
a decision to refuse consideration of a new asylum application (Annex 13
c) those who receive a decision on the grounds that Belgium is not responsible for their
asylum (annex 26 quater), EU nationals seeking asylum (Roma
Romania, for example), as well as people from a country considered safe
have a right of appeal does not suspend the order to leave the territory that was their
delivered.
Ecolo intends to end this discriminatory treatment: all asylum seekers should be
admitted to the temporary stay from the beginning of the asylum process and have access to a remedy
suspensive and full jurisdiction in all cases of a negative decision. Where an appeal is
filed with the Council of State against the CEC decision and that appeal is deemed admissible,
the execution of the decision of the CEC should be suspended, such that the asylum seeker
must continue to receive material help and seeing her extended temporary residence.

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter ASYLUM AND MIGRATION - p 13/22

Proposal: To recognize the special status of climate refugees
national and international level
From 2000 2050, 250 million people will have migrated because of phenomena directly
induced climate disturbances (floods, droughts, water shortages and food,
emerging diseases ...) and whose pollution from North of the planet is a major
officials.
The situation of these refugees is not explicitly covered by the international instruments
Existing protection or by Belgian law. Ecolo therefore advocates the creation of a protection
specific for this category of climate refugees.

Proposal: Enable the possibility offered by Directive 2001/22 / EC, which provides
to grant temporary residence in cases of mass influx of refugees
The news of the civil war in Syria makes the crucial need for the European Union to grant
immediate and temporary protection to persons fleeing their country en masse
mainly because of war, violence or human rights violations and to ensure
balance between the efforts undertaken by the Member States in receiving.
This Directive was adopted in 2001 following the Kosovo war of 1999 and helped welcome
many Kosovars within the European Union.
It has not been applied to other categories of people since then. The Member States of
the Union should request that it be applied to Syrian nationals fleeing massively
conflicts.

PRIORITY 4: IMPROVING PROCEDURES AND STAY REMEDIES
Proposal: Improve medical regularization procedure
To ensure the independence of physicians in the Foreign Office, Ecolo advocates
binding agreement that the Foreign Office will sign with them to ensure their
independence.
Ecolo also proposes to establish a fair and medical regularization procedure
contradictory. The objective is to improve the rights of regularization seekers, and impose

the introduction of the request. Otherwise, the application will be automatically considered
admissible;
A hearing of the applicant, accompanied where appropriate by his lawyer, an interpreter of
his doctor, and a person of trust shall be provided in all cases where the Office
foreign intends to take a negative decision, except in cases of technical refusal

justification of the impossibility of establishing);
The applicant, his lawyer and / or doctor must have access to the administrative file
of the opposing party and the documents on which it is based, including sources
relating to the availability and accessibility of care in countries of origin before a
taking a negative decision;

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter ASYLUM AND MIGRATION - p 14/22

The decision must be made deep within 4 months of hearing
admissibility;
The action for annulment with the CEC against decisions declaring admissible but not
founded a request for medical regularization should be suspensive of right.
Ecolo finally proposed that the medical filter at the admissibility of such claims.

Proposition: Enter into law clear and permanent criteria
regularization
It took over a year to the government (as of the governmental declaration of March 18
2008) to clear regularization criteria in an "instruction" of government
July 2009 statement that was eventually canceled early December 2010 by the State Council, the
because the determination of such regulation criteria is the responsibility of the legislator and
not the government. People who have seen issue a negative decision after
the examination of their application have therefore been invoked in the context of an appeal, respect for
criteria under government instruction.
For Ecolo, the regularization procedure should be based on five permanent criteria, listed in the
law and proceedings before an independent commission composed of three members (one
magistrate, a lawyer and a representative of a recognized NGO with activities in the
field of human rights). The criteria proposed by Ecolo are:
The long asylum procedure 3 years (including the duration of the procedure in the Council
State);
The inability to return to the country of origin;
Being seriously ill or disabled;
Having lasting social ties in the countries27 or be circumstances
Humanitarian to assert;
The availability of a draft socio-economic contribution in Belgium.

Proposal: Easing the conditions for family reunification
Except for EU nationals, foreigners established in Belgium and Belgians can not
be joined by their families if they have sufficient sources equivalent to at least 120% of
Social integration income (RIS) with dependent family, at least 1 € 256.98 net per month.
This requirement, which is not imposed on European, discriminates for Belgians
since treatment imposed on them is less favorable.
People with self-employed, employees on fixed-term contract
less than a year, temporary, people engaged in the framework of the art.60 of the Organic Law
CPAS, invalids, pensioners, and people who have just been laid off do
hardly manage to bring their families, their livelihoods are not
considered stable or sufficient. This restrictive policy forget how the family of
migrant is an important element in a humane and dignified integration in Belgium.
Ecolo intends to stop the discrimination between people based on their nationality: the
conditions of the right to family reunification should be the same for everyone, whether you are
EU national, that one is Belgian or foreign resident in Belgium.
27

Sustainable social ties are presumed if the person resides in Belgium for 5 years, for single and 4
years when it comes to families with school children. Alongside this draft law on the regularization
certain categories of foreigners, Ecolo filed another bill that deals more specifically children and
young miners arrived in Belgium and incorporated into it. In the proposed law, education in Belgium is
regularization criterion.

Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter ASYLUM AND MIGRATION - p 15/22

Ecolo therefore proposes that the conditions for family reunification of different categories of
people are aligned with the conditions of the consolidation of EU nationals established in
Belgium.
Under this alignment, it is necessary to allow the introduction of a grouping request
family with a third-country national authorized to permanent residence in Belgium, since the
Belgium, without having to be demonstrated exceptional circumstances or that we should be
legal residence.
Ecolo proposes to remove the requirement to have to have a national passport to the parent or
the adoption of a Belgian child who wishes to apply for family reunification.

Proposal: To regularize the stay of children and young people (with or
no) minors who arrived in Belgium and incorporated into it
Public opinion was repeatedly shocked to hear that young people and children,
school in Belgium for several years, are denied the right of residence, and that
young people from a country at war and to which the FPS Foreign Affairs advises against
travel, will be repatriated. Ecolo proposes to regularize their séjour28 well as that of / of
s parent when the child is a minor.

Proposal: Improve the procedure Aliens Litigation Council
Ecolo wants to simplify the procedure Aliens Litigation Council (CCE), keep this
which currently works well and repeat what worked well in the old procedure
the Permanent Commission for Refugee Appeals. Specifically, Ecolo offers:
A less rigid procedure (formal) and the opportunity to adduce new;
On asylum, the obligation for the CEC to give reasons if it deviates from a
opinion of the UNHCR29;
The accessibility of CEDOCA30 by the CEC which also will cover the possibility of instructing
request ;
A reformation of competence for the CEC - that is to say, the possibility of taking a
decision on the merits - in all subjects (and not only for asylum);
Rapid publication of the CEC decisions on its website with a search engine
performance. The figures and statistics of decisions granting or refusal rate in terms
asylum and cancellation will be published on the site by country and by role
linguistic ;
An obligation on the CEC to meet regularly bringing together the General Assembly
French and Dutch judges to decide on a common position on
to questions of asylum or residence. UNHCR will be systematically invited in his AG
and he can give advice on issues concerning asylum;
Reduced fees roles (currently set at € 175 per decisions) and perception
one right per family role;
A capacity building in terms of CEC staff for more treatment
Quick actions for annulment.

Proposal: Improve control of administrative detention
The Council Chamber has jurisdiction to review the legality of administrative detention,
but the introduction of a request to the Council Chamber does not stay the
deportation.
It would therefore appropriate when put into law:
the Council Chamber is also competent to review the desirability and
proportionality of detention;
when the Council Chamber is seized, expulsion is suspended pending the
decision.

PRIORITY 5: IMPROVE HOME AND FOREIGN MEDICAL AID
URGENT TO PERSONS IN IRREGULAR SITUATION

Proposal: Restore the right to social assistance for categories of persons
who have been deprived
An applicant rejected asylum, which introduces a new asylum application because it has
new evidence, no longer has the right to stay in a reception center run by
Fedasil31, as the administration has not yet issued a positive decision on taking
consider whether the new asylum application. The right to social assistance no longer exists for
asylum seekers in procedure to the State Council and was removed for citizens of
the European Union. Finally, families with children illegal miners still have a theoretical right
to home, but in practice, they have the choice of ending up homeless or visit
in the center of Holsbeek (back center).
For Ecolo, not depriving people of their rights that they bring real
solutions. Only proceedings conducted within a short time (including the ways of
remedy) can prevent a person spends years in foster structure.
Ecolo therefore proposes to restore:
The right to home for all asylum seekers, including when in use
Council of State against a decision of the CEC, or when they have been rejected and a request
having new elements to make, they introduce a new application;
The right to social assistance and the right to emergency medical assistance for citizens of
the European Union.

Proposal: Provide a right to material assistance during the examination of an application
medical regulation (Art. 9b)
The figures in medical regularization have never been lower. In 2012, about 14 027
medical claims analyzed, only 319 were declared founded (2.27%) 32, while in 2011
over 11,137 medical records reviewed, 629 have resulted in the granting of a residence permit (5.65%),
or more than double33.
This decrease is unfortunately not related to a decrease of applications: only foreigners
end stage of a disease, and can not move, get a

blind due to insulin-dependent diabetes ... There are many examples).
A seriously ill person can not cure properly if it has not enough food
and shelter.
Ecolo therefore proposes to grant a right to home for all regularization seekers

request.
PRIORITY 6: IMPROVE THE PROTECTION OF VULNERABLE CATEGORIES
Ecolo want special protection for the most vulnerable categories of migrants, as
are women, minors, whether accompanied or not, people with disabilities,
Victims of human trafficking and traumatized people.
Proposal: Consider the child's interest in all
decisions on asylum and residence
The interest of the child shall be a primary consideration in all the procedures
concern, whether a minor alien or a non accompagné34 came with his minor
family.
Welcoming families residing illegally should in no way be conditioned to a possible
commitment of the party to return to the country of origin. The home must be in a center
allowing in particular to continue schooling started by children, in the language
Teaching follows.
Proposal: To prohibit the detention of children
In 2011, under the pretext of wanting to enshrine in law the principle of the prohibition of confinement
children, which in practice had not occurred since the condemnation of Belgium by the Court
European rights homme35, the majority made possible again the detention of
Children, inserting an article in the law which provides that the detention of families with children is
possible in a suitable center. Given the planned construction of units for detention
families around the closed center Caricole, detention of minors with their parents
back in the news.
Ecolo opposes any form of detention of families with enfants36.
Proposal: Protecting women victims of violence familiales37
The victims of domestic violence, mostly women, have to be
effectively protected through various legal adaptations. Ecolo therefore proposes to grant:

Facilitation of the possibility of being remedied by the work for people who are
under Schedule 3538 for their use of Aliens Litigation Council and have
stable employment that allows them not to be borne by the government. It
requires a relaxation of the granting of work permits for an exemption from B
the examination of the labor market (regional competence). They should also receive
information on the procedure and on training for occupations in shortage.
When a B permit application is in progress and the procedure ends at CCE,
Annex 35 should be extended until a decision is taken by the administration
of the Region concerned.
PRIORITY 7: RELAX CONDITIONS FOR GRANTING OF BELGIAN NATIONALITY
Ecolo had obtained under the Arc-en-ciel government (1999-2003) suppression costs
procedure, deletion of the investigation of integration and the ability to apply for naturalization
after 3 years of living in Belgium. Today, the cost of the procedure is reintroduced, and
considering the integration of the written knowledge of a national language, and a criterion
Economic benefit for the "quick" way which provides Belgian nationality after 5

Annex 35 is a special document residence permit issued to the asylum seeker who has lodged an application for the Reformation
Aliens Litigation Council against a negative decision of the CGRA and abroad who brought an action against
a negative decision by the Immigration Department, for the duration of the review.
Ecolo program 2014 - International Relations Book - Chapter ASYLUM AND MIGRATION - p 19/22 years of stay in Belgique39. Those who do not meet this criterion should economic
wait 10 years of legal residence in Belgium and an uninterrupted stay on the date of introduction of the
demand, besides the knowledge of the language.
The nationality is likely to accelerate the integration of foreign nationals in Belgium
Ecolo proposes to remove the obstacles that make acquiring it difficult for people
socially disadvantaged:
Removing the obligation to pay € 150 to submit his application (cost of
procedure) ;
Deleting the current economic criterion (the 468 days of work during the five years
recent years) to request Belgian nationality after five years of residence because this criterion
is discriminatory in relation to certain categories of the population, the first
Victims of this condition being people who do not have jobs, those working
part-time housewives, low - or no - school, temporary;
Adaptation of current social criteria. Ecolo proposed to delete this requirement in
as it creates discriminatory situations, as people were able to follow
an integration course or not. Otherwise, a test to meet this criterion
Social must always be uniformly organized in Wallonia, Flanders and
Brussels region;
Relief knowledge of a national language in its oral knowledge, to avoid
that people with little or no literacy skills are excluded from the possibility of obtaining
Belgian nationality ;
Finally, a minor can never lose his nationality because of the loss of it by
parent or adopter.
39
This economic criterion is the fact of having worked at least 468 days over the last 5 years years.
Those who do not fulfill the economic criterion must wait 10 years of legal residence in Belgium and living
uninterrupted to the date of submission of the application, in addition to knowledge of the language.
