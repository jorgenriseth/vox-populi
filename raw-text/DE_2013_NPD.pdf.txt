Dear compatriots,
have you actually thought about why the NPD
is on all channels as well as daily conversation? Perhaps you are now answers to the tongue like: "because you're Nazis!" Or "Clear

But since we have to disappoint you. Of course, we are not "Nazis".
And the NPD is prohibited certainly not - because if you do
Prohibited would do, they would have been banned long ago. The last ban the NPD failed ten years ago, which is not this time

So - what is so bad that all politicians of the so-called contact us
"Democratic" parties, all mass media, day after day over
strutting us?

Could it perhaps be that the NPD with their political positions
is right? That they with their demands as the only party the right
Answers? Are we at the other parties why so hated?
And is you ever noticed that is constantly reported only on us, but that the media and politicians speak almost never with the NPD? Although it is always maintained, we would have no arguments
and would only thresh phrases?
Maybe that's not true, yes.
And now we tell you something that may surprise you: all
Parliamentary parties - are - the so-called "democratic" parties
in complete agreement on all important policy issues. Whether SPD or CDU,
FDP or green, it makes no difference: all want our
- Even yours! - Money to "save" the euro, Greece and other European debtor states, although all secretly know that these
Politics has long since failed.
All want more immigrants to come to Germany -
although foreigners not necessarily an "enrichment" for our country
are.
All parliamentary parties, through their policy for responsibility,
that life in Germany is becoming more expensive, that rents explode, that the electricity and fuel price increases that it is so hard to find a
to obtain affordable housing.
All mainstream parties want more "European" and therefore want
also do away with the Basic Law - but supposedly wants but the NPD
eliminate the Basic Law and the free democratic basic order in our country! Since it can not agree to something!
Do you notice something? Correct - only the NPD transmits for all negative developments that make life in Germany more expensive, no

For many years the social problems in the Federal Republic are

be no welfare state without the nation state and without national

National solidarity means: The capital has the economy

Pension fraud

At least since the autumn of 2012 can no longer be denied that the pensioners
in the Federal Republic systematically about their retirement and thus to
a worthy old age to be brought. Even normal earners
threatened in our country soon, the old-age poverty.
Thus, calculations show a quite high gross monthly salary
of 2,500 euros over 35 contribution years in future only be sufficient as of the year 2030 monthly pension to social assistance level
to reflect in the amount of 688 Euro. Nationwide obtained according to
the Federal Employment Agency 54 percent of all workers a gross monthly salary of up to 2,500 euros. In central Germany there are even
69 percent who earn less than 2,500 euros.
At the same time the cost of living rise immeasurably. Energy and food costs and rising health care costs ensure that hardly any remains of the pension slightly.
Already today there are many living in abject poverty pensioners. But to serious problem age poverty for the majority of the younger generation. Anyone with unpaid traineeships, part-time, temporary and / or

Taxes must
be fair!

The tax revenues of the federal, state and local governments rise and rise. Therefore, the workers only remain of every euro
about 48 cents. Even so, more and more taxpayers perceive the
Control system aligned in Germany as one-sided and unfair.
At the same time the leaders moan about the allegedly increasing
Taxpayers denial in the Federal Republic. But as long as the State
citizens literally robbing and there is no fairness in taxation,
it is not surprising that the number of tax increases objectors.
Germany finally needs a simple, understandable and
fair tax system where everyone after his performance
is taxed and thus contributing his personal share in defraying the Community's tasks.
We are committed to the fact that a tax law that the mainly

Supreme benchmark national democratic politics is the responsibility for survival and continued existence of the German people in its ancestral Central European habitat. At
Accordance with the provisions of the UN Charter, we reject the mass immigration and the change in the ethnic majorities in the
urban areas of our country as an attack on the integrity
and identity of our people from consistently.
Meanwhile officially almost 16 million people live in Germany with foreign roots - due to continued
Mass immigration and above average high birth rate especially of non-European populations with increasing
Trend. Illegal foreigners living in Germany burden the balance sheet
additionally.
In many metropolitan centers, the proportion of non-German approaches to the resident population of the 50 per cent mark - these cities
threaten their German character in the foreseeable future to irrevocably
to lose. The effects are already visible in many places: Anatolian and Arab gangs that dominate entire neighborhoods, parallel societies with their own legal structures, huge mosques as symbols
a blatant Islamic conquest and schools where
German children are in the minority. Germany is now smaller
as the Federal Republic.
The most visible sign of unbridled foreign domination of our country is the expansive spread of Islam. Radical Islamic Salafists
distribute offensive Quran copies in German and call for violence against "infidels" in Germany.
Even now are foreigners, according to police and security agencies in
Section to more than 30 percent of crimes committed in Germany felony
such as murder, manslaughter and rape involved. The unstoppable Islamization gives this development additional explosiveness.

Contrary to the phrases of the established parties, we consider
Foreigners in Germany therefore not principally as "enrichment"
but - in view of the exorbitant costs of an illusory "integration" and the above-average crime rate
by non-German suspects - rather than burden on our
Future and social peace in our country.
The cost of a hopeless "integration" caused by the mass immigration threaten the German welfare state. Every German must statistically shell out more than 1,200 euros for the "integration" of living in Germany million foreigners annually.
This figure alone punishes the mantra repeated by the established parties assertion lies, the Federal Republic was due
the alleged "shortage of skilled workers" to even more immigration
instructed. The truth about the professionals lie is: millions of qualified German today are unemployed, while the majority of here
foreigners living has only limited academic and vocational qualifications. The completely failed immigration policy of the incumbent
Parties primarily causes a migration to the German
Social systems and another irresponsible burden on
German taxpayers.
The influx of refugees and asylum seekers in our country
taking in the wake of current crises and an irresponsible EU enlargement policy towards ever more. Long since the record highs of earlier
Exceeded years. In 2011 alone, the number of asylum seekers rose by 11.5
Percent compared to last year. Increased by the judgment of the Federal Constitutional Court, according to which cash benefits for asylum seekers
to be, the Federal Republic as a destination for economic migrants from around the world will be even more attractive than before.

established parties inflicted catastrophic development in the area

The smallest natural community of every people is the family.
On it are based people and the state, in their values ​​and traditions are passed. The stable long-term cohabitation between man
and woman is also the only family form, earned the promotion and special state protection, because only in her children born
become. For a healthy growing children need mothers and fathers,
paying special attention in the first years of life living with both parents as a fixed reference persons laid the foundation for the mental health of the next generation.
The increasing proportion of lone parents is not only an expression of increasing social dislocation (precarious work,
required flexibility and availability in the labor market) and partnership arbitrariness, but also an expression of attachment disorders as a result of unsafe own bonds in childhood. To this
To break cycle, both vigorous financial support as well as a fundamental change in values ​​in favor of the family are required. The appreciation of our children and families will not start

The aim of national family policy can not comprehensive early childhood

thinly is obvious. The NPD therefore urges a rethink: away from watering towards an effective delivery system
exclusively German families and children benefit
must. Expected conflicts with the EU must not go out of the way a responsible German government.

Marriage loan
If the marriage loan of 18,000 euros German couples without interest with a maturity of 15 years at birth of first child
paid. The first five years are repayment dates, then the loan is paid back in up to 120 equal monthly installments. With the
Birth of first child reduces the repayment amount to a,
with the birth of her second child by another third. With the birth

Mothers content
A family policy core demand of the NPD is the introduction of a
tax-free, socially taxable salary for mothers at home
permanent main caregiver of the children in one after the number of children
staggered height. The first child 1,000 euros net salary paid mothers, with every additional child, this amount increased by 400
Euro net. Only in this way can be a real choice between opting for an education in the family or the use of
Home care be ensured. Freedom of choice does not mean the
Choose between poverty and double burden of mothers. The mothers content is one part of a financial, retirement effective protection of women, on the other hand is this salary, which of course

For reasons of "social indications" were so completely eliminated. As
a first step in the right direction of the political family of us
demanded mothers content recognizes the NPD, the care allowance for

Parents who want to educate their children in the first years of life at home.

Child benefit
Another family political demand is the increase in child benefit of 500 euros for every German child. This roughly corresponds to the
Amount of needed children basic security. Is In order to finance
child benefits should be deleted for foreigners. Families are in the Federal Republic of unspeakable incitement by the media and political class
exposed. Parents need in her intuitive talent, to educate children,
be strengthened again. Therefore calls for the NPD, the tearing apart

the Community should strengthen. We also urge courses for expectant
Parents ("family license" and / or trained family helper) to

An increasingly globalized economic world requires no stable
Families, but readily available, cheap, homeless and rootless
Workers. Conversely, families and children need no globalized economy, but social security, time for each other, political reliability, real role models and confidence in the future. These
"Soft factors" can not provide the current, hanging on a drip business party cartel and therefore tried this systemic deficit by always new ephemeral "actions", "Promotion"

The primary objective of national health policy is the preservation and improvement of public health. The focus of the health policy of the NPD is therefore not profit mostly international
