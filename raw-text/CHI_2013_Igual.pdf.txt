Introduction
This 2013 the people of Chile will face one of the most important dilemmas of its history.
They must choose between two opposing and irreconcilable alternatives country with future
radically different.
The first alternative is to extend in time the Chile we live in today, that it forces us to
suffer and do magic to make ends meet; to humble ourselves before the big stores do not
to pay the fees of his cards that we have begun to use because our miserable
wages are simply not enough; to commit the injustice of having to choose which of our
We send our daughters or sons to college because the system does not allow us
debts to enslave everyone go; have to put usury
companies and banks get rich topping our social housing that the State
It requires us to pay a price of apartment in Providencia and Las Condes; not to do
nothing when our children, uniforms and all, are brutally beaten and
beaten by the police for simply pass sue a school for all
year; Transantiago I thought to suffer that day, designed and implemented by people
they do not have the foggiest idea what it is to suffer a journey by public transport from
unpaved our people to our workplaces, where more above us
exploit; that we are treated unworthily offering alms to 40,000 pesos a year to
keep knees easing our daily suffering with pain; in short, to live
daily abuse that for two centuries, but with special intensity from the past
forty, imposes a society that can only be sustained on the basis of oppression,
abuse, inequality and brutal all and for having injustices.
The other alternative is to join Guacolda and Lautaro, Caupolicán and Fresia, Manuel
Rodriguez and Francisco Bilbao, Emilio Recabarren and elena caffarena to Clotaire Blest, Rodrigo
Tanks and Matthias Catrileo, all anonymous anonymous fighters and fighters who,
in their own time and with the means at their disposal, they chose to stand up against
oppression and injustice and to struggle for a better society. This 2013 the people of Chile
We can say "Enough!" and put an end to centuries of pain, looting, exploitation and abuse. Can we
stand up to take the role that capital, dictatorship and political duopoly
we were robbed and take the road of building a republic in which the people
send and society in excess of capitalism, ie, a republic and society
made by majorities and majorities. This is the alternative for which we have chosen
social movements.
The road now undertaking is the result of the unification of struggles
resistance against neoliberalism that different popular organizations have in their
respective territories. Those long years of struggle have allowed the popular movement
mature and develop sufficient social, political and ideological tools for creating and
drive your own project. That is, it has developed tools that allow it to be
protagonist.
5

The popular movement begins to be protagonist means, among other things, that will
subject of his own project and not an object of representation. Thanks to the avant-garde and
adventurous / lit / as who have offered their services driving this stand
standing in society. But we are confident and convinced that the movement has
reached sufficient maturity to conduct himself, through his own
leadership. Therefore, this 2013, for the first time in the history of Chile, commit the act
subversive and revolutionary to contest in the polls with state power applications
popular at all levels of representation, from the regional councils to
presidency of the Republic.
To give this new struggle, the popular movement has called social organizations
and policies to build its program of government that it is gathered in this document.
The program proposals contained here have been developed thinking in four
principles and objectives:
1. A partnership to defeat capitalism
2. A republic in which the people send
3. The recovery of our rights
4. A society of good living
The proposals of all social and political organizations that have participated in the
creation of this program of government support in one or more of these four pillars
which, we believe, lead to the construction of a just society. We can only invite
everyone to participate in the great task of making it happen. It depends on us and us
build a new Chile. In this task we summon.

I. Overcoming of capitalism
1. Capitalism to the chilean way
Chile born as a nation-state in capitalism fully insert. Indeed, although
practically throughout the first century Republican productive forces and relations
predominant production in the organization of its economy were sparsely
capitalists, their emergence on the world stage was the result of the development and expansion of
capitalism and from the central economies, in need of new markets and
suppliers beyond their national territories. We can say, therefore, that Chile,
As an important part of nation-states of this hemisphere, it was created by the
capitalism need to meet their demands for raw materials, as part of
the Spanish crown, the incipient colonial commercial bourgeoisie could not transact freely in the
World Market.
This contradiction between a social formation in its internal structure, produced with
techniques and under pre-capitalist social relations, from one side to the other side,
meet the demands of a capitalist world economy in the process of global expansion,
peripheral marked the economic, political and social development of Chile during the nineteenth century
important part of the twentieth. The result was a heterogeneous and deeply unequal society.
Inequality expressed in the increasingly widening gap between emerging
capitalist production structure, predominantly in urban and mining areas, and the pre-capitalist agrarian, predominantly in rural areas. But it was especially dramatic in
economic, political and cultural gaps among all social classes. Such gaps
They were so rude that inspired singing Violeta Parra Chile "... limited to the center
injustice ... ".
In the last forty years, however, the deep inequality generated by the development
peripheral capitalist has been enhanced and taken to unimaginable limits by
implementation and development of a regime of accumulation which is the version more
wild and extreme capitalism: the Pinochet-concertacionista neoliberalism, capitalism
the Chilean Way. Far from trying to soften and cushion the most dramatic consequences of
Capitalism, as indeed tried the welfare state and commitment that was created and
expanded in Chile between 1938 and 1973, the Chilean neoliberalism deliberately promotes
its main contradictions fundamentally unequal. According to Jovino Novoa, one
of its main advocates, "... inequality is a characteristic of nature
human [and] ... There is no greater mistake than to try to force the nature of things "; Therefore, the
search for equality is something "warm and mediocre" (sic). Deprivation and inequality
They constitute an incentive boost individual initiative, that they believe the ideologues
neoliberals, is the engine that moves to an economy and a society.

7

The reality, of course, is far from as idyllic panorama. Neoliberalism
Chile has developed thanks and as a result of the following processes:
- Conversion to market conditions of production and exchange of all goods,
services and resources, mercantilizables or not to extend more and more areas
accumulation;
- Expeditious access global capital to strategic areas of the national economy,
mainly to natural resources;
- Increasing dominance of financial capital and services on industrial;
- "Subsidiary" State reduced to a minimum;
- Social atomization;
- Disruption of organizations and social fabric to prevent balances from the
society to the accumulation of big capital;
- And the icing on the cake: pact between capital and politicians, among large groups
overall national economic and, on one side, and the main forces represented
Parliament, on the other, in order to safeguard and protect the accumulation from the system
political.
The consequences of these processes on the economy, politics and culture are manifold.
Superlative concentration: But in all these areas the same pattern is observed.
Economic concentration, political and cultural concentration concentration.
In the economic system, one can observe tendencies duo or oligopolistic concentration
in virtually all areas, from banking to pharmacies, through the system
pension, agribusiness and forestry, construction, health, retail and whole sector
services. In each of these sectors dynamics it is basically the same each time
fewer actors (companies or individuals) will capture more and more resources,
revenue or market positions.
A shocking example of concentration can be seen in Table 1, which shows the
distribution of access to credit in 2008. There you can see that 76.9% of
applicants (629 711 debtors and debtor) should be played only 2% of credit offers
the financial system. At the other end, only 2,106 debtors and debtor (0.3% of
total) is left with almost 34 billion pesos, 70% credit.

8

This phenomenon of concentration in the credit market today is a pattern that is replicated
many of the areas of the economy: the number of competitors and the reduced
great stay with an increasing slice of the market or benefits. This, and not
another is the hallmark of the Chilean neoliberal capitalism.

to/

The concentration produced by capitalism to the chilean direct impact on the way
welfare and development of the Chilean and Chile. To begin with, destroys outdoor own
market, as, as it operates in Chile, generates high levels of concentration. And more
concentration, smaller exchanges regulated by the free market. Thus the free market
ends up destroying the free market.
In addition, the concentration in the market has its counterpart in the income immediately, and for that
Satellite, welfare and lives of all people. As shown in Figure 1, the
product stratospheric Chile has grown in the past two decades. Between 1990 and
2012, per capita GDP climbs from the current $ 2,678 to US $ 15,372. This
equivalent to 473% growth. The minimum wage, meanwhile, grew from US $ 85.3
up to US $ 396.5 in the same period, that is only 365%. In simple terms,
working men and women of Chile today generate 473% higher than the 1990 wealth,
but their minimum wages have grown by 108% from the product
generated by their work.
The situation is even more dramatic when the evolution of the average pay is observed.
While per capita GDP jumps of 172.12% from US $ 4183.2 in 1993 to $ US
10119.4 in 2009, the average wage measured by the INE only grew 111.1% in the same

period, from 315.2 up to $ 665.4 at current prices 1. That means
Chilean workers and the Chilean workers produced a 172.12% increase in wealth
2009 than in 1993, but on average, only receive remuneration equivalent to 111.1%
more. The difference of 61% growth builds on the current account of those
They star in the process of economic concentration.

2. From the bluffs to the real alternative
Until today, three alternatives have been proposed to tackle the serious problems and
Chilean limitations of neoliberal capitalism.
The first proposal is very widespread today, to attack their externalities
unwanted, especially increasingly unsustainable inequality, with the development of
income distribution mechanisms. Generally, the above mechanism is
the increase in taxes, mainly levied value added, which is
presented as a tax on companies (?).
This supposed "solution" creates more problems than it solves. For starters, it is a
So naive to assume that the inequalities produced by neoliberal capitalism, which are
structural and specific to their way of organizing the economy and the rest of society,
power will be lessened even a little more tax. And in the unlikely event that
succeed distributing income, would leave intact the other areas of high
concentration generated by neoliberal capitalism. Secondly, with VAT by
indirect taxes has serious regressive effects. In fact, it accentuated inequalities
instead of attacking. Just a little simple arithmetic to know that raising the VAT of 19%
26% would mean an additional 7% of the budget burden on families of children
income. Finally, enter a distributive mechanism without modifying the structural basis
of neoliberal capitalism, far from attacking its problems and limitations, it is an attempt to
patch it, to give oxygen to keep it running. It is not, therefore, a
alternative or project not against or anti-neoliberal. On the contrary, it is a gamble
give continuity policy.
The second proposal is to proclaim and establish rights that would guarantee the
"Nationalization" or "nationalization" of natural resources. It is somewhat difficult to know how
such a measure could be an alternative to neoliberalism, especially since
that the neoliberal era has been the most generous in proclaiming new rights: rights
third-generation and fourth-generation rights. Rights are not guaranteed
overcoming some of neoliberalism. Today "rights" are guaranteed keeping
intact the structural basis of the neoliberal accumulation.
Finally, it has been proposed to combat neoliberal capitalism with the establishment of archaism

about why that is not an alternative to capitalism. Suffice it to say simply that
planned economies develop class contradiction between the workers and the

eleven

workers on the one hand, and a bureaucracy that controls the means of administration that
allow appropriate surplus value generated by them and them on the other. Therefore, it
They are far from being an alternative to capitalism. Unlike. They are the case more
representative of the accumulation regime of "state capitalism", which is as capitalist
as market capitalism.
The three proposals mentioned have been presented as ways of overcoming or
alternatives to neoliberal capitalism. But, as could be seen, they are far from it.
Moreover, in the first case we have a proposal patch to give oxygen and allow
to survive; in the second case, no proposal whatsoever. And in the third case, it is proposed
overcome neoliberal capitalism for state capitalism. Therefore, in Chile we have
three bluffs, but no alternative to the present economic system proposal. This program,
it sums up the first alternative historical project to capitalism in Chile since 1970.
Our proposal for overcoming capitalism rests on seven pillars:
- The development of a self-management and solidarity economy
- The re-industrialization of the economy
- The popular control of natural resources
- The popular control of the production process
- A reorganization of working order
- Agriculture
- Sovereignty and food security

3. Towards a self-management and solidarity economy
Self-management is a non-capitalist forms of work organization that develops in the
within communities or social organizations. It is intended to solve and answer
their main needs and demands. "Non-capitalist organization of work" means
physical and mental activity who works on a self-managed project is not aimed at
generate surplus value and profit, but to respond to the demand or need that affects you.

12

Self-management is opposed to two typical capitalist forms of responding to problems and
needs: State social programs and so-called "enterprise". TO
Unlike the first, self-define their own objectives and establishes the means
to achieve them. State social programs, however, come with objectives and means
defined by public bureaucracies. They also define the responsible and
planning and execution of their projects, which are usually government officials or
companies / non-public organizations. State programs accordingly imposed
objectives, methods, plans and execution communities or organizations seeking
favor. By contrast, self-management activities are responsible for the
planning and implementing their own projects. They constitute a form of exercise
autonomy.
Unlike the "enterprise", meanwhile, is an action-oriented response to
needs and demands obtaining economic benefit, self-management aims
only to respond to the need or demand, and nothing else. Not intended generation
profit or gain for the parties. It is also a form of collective action, organized and
cooperative. It relies on the autonomous capacity of organized communities and not in the
isolated individual efforts of its members. The project, however, is a
atomized, inorganic and competitive activity. Its subject is the individual entrepreneur
generating companies to profit from it. The subject of self-management, however, is the
community or social organization that needs solutions, not private profit.
Our proposal to promote self-management as an alternative to "enterprise"
capitalism is based on concrete experiences that the popular movement has been
practice in recent years to address housing needs and education. Their
solutions such as the housing complex Settlers Movement in Fight
Peñalolén, the MPL1 have failed to meet social demands with products
higher quality and lower costs than the "private enterprises" (real estate,
and subsidized private schools, etc.). This is because, among other things, the
self-managed projects allocated all its resources to the solution itself; should not
allocate funds to private enrichment of the owners of a company.
Based on these successful experiences, our government will begin the transition to an economy
less dependent on "entrepreneurship" and based on self-management projects.
To this end, we will implement four key measures:
a) Creation of a Secretariat for the Promotion and Development of the Self-Management
Ministry of Economy, which, as will be seen below, will be renamed "Ministry of
Economy, Self-Management and Technological Development ".
b) Creating public funds for the development of self-management projects with special
emphasis on projects to meet and ensure social, economic and
cultural in the areas of housing, education, health and environment.

13

c) Reassignment this background of all resources for the promotion of "entrepreneurship"
d) Tax Incentives for all self-management activities
With these four steps forward to establish the cornerstone for the development of a
no capitalist economy, based on social solidarity and not in search of profit.

4. Towards the re-industrialization of the Chilean economy
Capitalism the chilean way they have built 40 years of neoliberal governments
not only it has the unenviable record of having created one of the most unequal societies in the world.
He is also completing generate a radical de-industrialization of the economy of Chile.
In 1973, despite the boycott and all, 26.04% of GDP was generated by industry
manufacturing. Only 12 years later, in 1985, its contribution to GDP had fallen to 15.68%. And in
2012 barely reached to 10.21%.
But that's not the worst news. The deindustrialization of AI Chilean economy has gone
with the growth of two of the most harmful forms of capital and against the interests
of the majority: the extractive capital and rentier-financial-services of capital. Mining, which
in 1973 it accounted for 8.46 of GDP, in 2012 it generated 12.98 Product. And services
financial and business, which in 1985 contributed the 12.93 of GDP, are now responsible for
18.42% (see Figure 2). That is the legacy of 40 years of neoliberal policies: while
Capital extractive our non-renewable mineral resources without even paying royalty devours,
the rentier-of-service financial capital is responsible to pay prices
hyperinflated for necessities and for our rights as a result
of speculation. The formula of capitalism to the chilean way is simple: to stop producing and
begin to plunder the land and speculate.
Chilean industrialization is so severe that people ideologically opposed to each other,
as Gaston Lewin, president of the Chilean Association of Metallurgical Industries and
Metalworking (Asimet) or Pedro Páez, president of the committee responsible for
implementation of the South Bank, agree that approaching alarming levels. They and
many other and other professionals have pointed out that the economy is one of the
More important for our country to reach the development obstacles.

Because we bet for Chile developed capable of guaranteeing minimum conditions for
the good life, the main economic priority of our government will, together with the conversion of
the economy of profit in a solidarity self-management economy, reverse the serious and sustained
tendency to de-industrialization. To do this, we will implement measures short, medium and
long term.
In the short term, we will implement a major tax revolution aimed at several
objectives, one of which is to encourage the re-industrialization of our economy. The
details of the reform are detailed below. Regarding the re-industrialization two
They are fundamental:
a) We will complete tax stamp with a specific tax of 1%
the largest financial transactions to $ 2.5 million pesos.
b) engrave a specific tax of 10% on all income from financial capital.
Proceeds from this tax will go entirely to finance projects
self-managed industrial in the area of ​​technology and curriculum reform
school education.
For the medium term, create economic entities under popular control (EEBCP) that
They will take care of rational industrialization of our main products
natural resources, to avoid the added value generated in the core countries of
global capitalism. The EEBCP also manage and be responsible for the production of
fifteen

necessities, which will be determined with the budget survey
family, that from our government will be made semiannually.
In the long term we will make the main factor of the Chilean economy the industry
technology, which generates high added value and is intensive in what neoliberalism calls
"Highly qualified human capital." After 3 governments of the popular movement, Chile
It will be transformed into a center of technological development. To finance the productive parts
we use technology to the collection of income taxes financial capital.
This fund will be invested in the creation of technology and a thorough reform EEBCPs
the basic education curriculum and a half to do intensive capabilities
technology development. All these policies also will be managed by a
Vice Ministry of Technological Development, under a completely renovated
Ministry of Economy, Development of self-management and technological development.
Strictly speaking, the re-industrialization fails to capitalism, which is the ultimate goal of
our project. The industry, as we know, is a creation of capitalism. Until
A few decades ago, the major capitalist economies were highly industrialized.
Therefore, industrialize an economy is not equivalent to overcome capitalism. Or more
But it is not enough to overcome it. But the re-industrialization is a precondition and
necessary to move towards a capitalist economy IA. Based on an economy AI
essentially living services, speculation and looting of minerals, all
essentially economic profit-oriented activities, you can not create a new one
It is not organized for private profit production. Only re-industrializing the economy
overcome capitalism. But without re-industrialize we can not do it. On the base
from an industrial economy we can develop the popular control of production, which itself is
a way of overcoming capitalism.

5. The popular control of natural resources
Neoliberal capitalism has found in the exploitation of natural resources of its
main sources of profit. In particular, the exploitation of mineral resources. In Chile,
furthermore, neoliberalism has generated particularly favorable conditions and not
repeated in any other country in the world for mining. There are three fundamental:
- In Chile the exploitation of non-renewable natural resources, particularly mining, not
It is encumbered with any kind of royalty. The profit tax that bears that name
is that: a tax on profits, no royalty. This allows not only the capital extractive
deplete our natural resources, but also take all the profit from their exploitation
Chile outside even while taxes in the country. Windfall.

16

- Chilean neoliberalism debits the account of all the people the cost of meeting the
increasing energy demand for the exploitation of our resources. The burden has not only
raising the cost of energy consumption; It is also destroying their natural heritage
and attacking public health with highly polluting energy projects. And all
this, not to forget, with mining forced to pay a tax to the profits laughable
evade and elude and whenever they want
- Chile's political class has been easily co-opted by global mining capital. The biggest
part of their demands, therefore, has a green light, including the transfer of territorial sovereignty,
as with the Pascua Lama project.
The current economic system in Chile has allowed the installation of the rougher version
extractive capitalism in our country. And, little by little, it has spread to the exploitation of
other natural resources such as fisheries and forestry. Under these conditions, the operation
of all our natural resources can only be made in favor of global capital and
against the interests of the people of Chile. The benefits from the exploitation of our
natural heritage is in the hands of transnationals as important part of the costs
externalities and the need to take us and us.
A conservative estimate puts the loss suffered by Chile between 1990 and 2008
as a result of this procedure applied to the exploitation of copper could reach 200
billion. There would be three reasons:
- We deliver the concentrate without melting or refining or manufacture in Chile; therefore not
recover gold, lithium, molybdenum, silver and other minerals that are in the "debris" that
export;
- We allow future operations of foreign corporations, evasion and
tax avoidance; the falsification of balance sheets; paying hefty interest rates of
Chilean subsidiaries to their foreign parent;
- And especially for the low price generated by rampant exploitation of our
deposits over global demand, under the Organic Law 18,097
Constitutional 1982.
To prevent and reverse situations such as occurred with copper, our government will initiate a
recovery policy of natural resources for the benefit of the people of Chile.
During 2014 and constitucionalizaremos create the category of "Natural Resource
Strategic interest "(NREN). The NREN be exploited solely for the benefit
of the people of Chile and can not be privately operated for profit. The
ownership of resources and infrastructure to exploit all NREN will
Chile and all Chileans.

17

The creation of NREN will provide the framework and institutional support to invite the great
explorer and operator of natural resources to leave the territory Chilean capital. Without the large
silvoindustrial-fishing agro-extractive capital and start the way the organization does not
Capitalist exploitation of our natural resources. That involves not only property
collective resources, but also planning exploration, exploitation and
export, in sectors where possible, such as copper, generated or
extract only the necessary resources to finance the guarantee of rights and good living
the people of Chile.
Currently, as we saw in the case of copper, exploited and predates all the resource
possible for national and transnational economic groups that control
get the greatest possible benefit. And that is not only exhausting unsustainably. The
which it is worse: in the case of the copper market largely controlled by Chile, that low
selling prices substantially, generating a lower marginal income per unit
produced and sold.
Planning for the exploration, exploitation and export of natural resources allow
dosing our production so that we can balance generating profits for
Chile villages sustentabildiad sustainability and long-term resource.
The responsibility for planning rest with the responsible entity popular power
exploration, production and export of each natural resource of strategic interest. They will
directed and managed by instances of popular control of the production process
described in the next section.

6. The popular control of the production process
The fourth pillar of the capitalist economy not build is the popular control
production process. "Popular control of the production process" means that workers and
workers involved in the management and profit sharing for all units
economic and productive installed in Chilean territory and to participate, along with spokesmen and
spokespersons of organizations of the territory, in the directory or board of the company or
institution. Thus the relationship of subordination, characteristic of capitalism is broken, the
worker and the worker to the employer.
Among the steps 2014 and 2016, the government will begin a transition to popular control
through two measures:
a) The directives creating popular assemblies in each production entity of the country,
They will be made up of two groups: delegates of workers and
workers and spokespersons of social organizations in each territory where
18

the company operates. This assembly will appoint their spokespersons to the board or
board of companies and institutions.
b) The creation of democratic mechanisms for selecting workers who
They participate in the administration and in the directory or advice ..
The installation will take place gradually popular control. During the first year in office
we will begin the popular control of production in sectors of strategic interest
national economy, mainly in the exploitation of non-renewable natural resources.
Then it will be extended to agriculture and is one of the fundamental pillars of a new reform
land. And so on: every year the popular control will extend to other areas of the
economy.

7. Towards a new work order
Popular control of the production process is in itself a revolutionary paradigm shift
in social work organization. As part of the hierarchical subordination between employer / a
and worker / a capitalism itself not only one of the most radical forms institutionalizes
inequality and social asymmetry, but work becomes a commodity rather than
It is acquired on the market for obtaining gain. In capitalism the chilean way, the
subordination and the concept of work as commodities have been taken to the extreme:
regulations and institutions that protects are designed to facilitate the accumulation.
Therefore, vulnerability, precariousness, flexibility, union weakness, lack of
effective right to strike, replacements are the norm.
When proposing the popular control of the production process we are also proposing
a radical change in how to organize and design work. In the new paradigm
propose, work is no longer a commodity. Unlike. The work is a source of
creation of social wealth, a source of identity and a means of personal fulfillment and
collective. And certainly, the working men and women become protagonists
the history.
Implement the paradigm shift that we propose requires removing all regulations and
labor practice to try to work as a commodity. That is, you must create a new order
labor. In it, we understand the working men and women both in its dimension
Individual subject and subject as in its dimension of subjects and subject groups / as. He
We propose new work order that is built according to both dimensions.

19

7.1 The male and female workers as subjects / as individual
In the individual dimension, we propose to build the new work order based on
following proposals:
a) Remove the system of subcontracting and the rules of the EST, recognizing the existence
a single employer, the one who is providing the service in terms of being under their
supervision and dependency and, consistent with this, legally recognize the existence of the
Holding as a single legal entity. This avoids bankruptcy, simulations
and evasion of responsibility that are now possible, extending the rule to only RUT
tax matters.
b) Establish a compensation payment on the last business day of the month for all and all
workers and must pay the safest and easiest way for the worker performed,
privileging the cash or accounts without maintaining views by the worker.
c) Establish a maximum period of 30 days to regularize the payment of the deposits
declared and unpaid.
d) To issue an interpretative law of Bustos Law is established that non-payment of
any compulsory enforcement will sanction imposed by the law, and make it
extend to any of the grounds for termination of the employment relationship, except that
involve criminal conduct by the employee.
e) The obligation to pay the bonus to each employee and the payment in the case of
there is no real utility company, is a tax credit against payment of tax
notch.

7.2 The male and female workers as individuals / groups / as
Workers and workers generate national wealth and keep alive its economy.
However, they lack the minimum conditions for exercising their rights. The lack of
poor level of organization and convening of the institutions created to coordinate / as
They have been a major obstacle to achieving rapid and effective reforms that improve and
guarantee the already slumping and precarious labor rights recognized by the
Chilean neoliberalism.
The lack of organization and the low rate of unionization are a breeding ground operations
Division workers from employers and the framework necessary for

20

that political parties that support and promote neoliberalism co-opt the leaders and women leaders.
Consider that the way to reverse the weakened position of workers and
workers is only one: the reorganization. Retrieve the worker and the worker as a
subject of transformation of Chile implies at first that this is capable of
defend their most basic rights and are constantly violated. And that requires
major changes in labor law:
a) In Chile there is no effective right to strike, as the current law allows replacement.
Reform the Labour Code to repeal replacement.
b) There is no effective sanction for anti-union practices and the immediate control
complaints from unions or workers. The Department of Labour, as a body whose
leading authorities who will rotate as it reaches the presidential headpiece is a
political body whose orientation changes with the government of the day, it hurts
only male and female workers. To avoid this situation, we propose that
the Director or the Director of Labour is elected by popular vote and his position last 10 years.
c) There is no obligation to deliver truly effective "essential background" to
prepare a collective project. Documents marked as required by labor law,
if they are not delivered, they generate a fine minor (Article 315, paragraph 5 of the
Labour Code). We multiply the current fine by 10.

8. Fair Trade Act: matching the field for SMEs
One of the sectors hardest hit by the excessive economic concentration is the
suppliers of large companies. Composed mainly of micro, small and
sized enterprises, the group of suppliers is subject to the worst of despotisms: the
discretion of oligopoly power.
One of the privileges of big business in Chile is to define the date we will pay their
providers. If you have a little awareness, you will pay within 60 days. If you can not afford
to meet its debt by up to 365 days. As the income of the SMEs provider
It depends on sales to large companies, has no choice but to abide by the terms
it wants to impose.
Nor is it uncommon for large companies decide to pay unless agreed after
months of receipt of the goods and services. They take refuge in the asymmetry that gives them

21

economic capacity to maintain and extend judicial proceedings by legal counsel
high cost that the SMEs can not always afford to hire.
The economic concentration, in short, generates extremely trading conditions
asymmetrical between large enterprise and SME supplier, which affect the ability of
subsistence of the latter. To combat these asymmetries, our government will process the Act
fair trade, which legally regulate the trade and relations
both parties not to market power abuses are committed.
The law establishes:
a) A legal term of a maximum of 30 days for payment of bills
b) The creation of a Superintendency of Fair Trade to oversee compliance
provision
c) The role of the Superintendency of representing providers and suppliers to initiate
Contracting lawsuits against companies for goods and services

9. Towards a new agrarian reform
Agrarian reform is a change in the ownership of the land they usually
affect the productive, cultural and environmental life of the rural world. The protagonist of these
transformations is the peasant rural people, the / employees / as agro-industry and
the / medium / as and small / as owners / as.
Land reform is the answer to an ownership and organization of the unfair land
and contrary to the majority interests of those living in and from it or society in
whole. It arises where the sovereignty and land ownership are concentrated in
a few families, as in Chile throughout the republican era, or a few
large agribusiness transnational capitalists, as at present.
In Chile the first land reform timidly began in the government of Carlos Ibáñez del
Field and it culminated in the management of the Unidad Popular. In September 1973, the process had
expropriation reached almost 10 million hectares in favor of farmers and
peasant. The objective of this first land reform, as hinted, was to replace a
oligopolistic structure of land ownership, which was controlled by a handful of families
landowners, by a distributed and decentralized structure, with special participation in
she of whom work directly, the peasantry.

22

The coup of 1973 put a stop to this first reform. In dictatorship, thousands of leaders
peasants were killed and repressed as part of an intensive process of agrarian counter, also it returned 4.5 million of the 10 million hectares expropriated
until the coup. Another undetermined amount was transferred to government agencies and forces
Navies. As a result, 60% of the land originally expropriated never reached the
hands of peasants and farmers.
Part of the agrarian counter-reform was carried out through the neoliberal deregulation
land market. This allowed the corporatisation of the field penetration in the economy
capitalist agricultural companies looking to exploit agriculture for profit and gain.
The main manifestations of corporatization were not only the slow movement
the old landowning families control the land, but also the slow agony of the
old forms of relationships and pre-capitalist organization of work that these families had
It developed over centuries in the so-called "hacienda". Indeed, substitution of the
lands for agribusiness was the ultimate capitalist exploitation of the earth step. That
He brought about the development of the wage-earning job in a particular format
chilean way to capitalism: seasonal work / as so-called / as "temporary / as".
The capitalist agribusiness also created a new economic activity and that of
"Contractors", which act as intermediaries between employers agro-industry and / as
workers / as. With this, the legal responsibilities for the employee working longer
remain in the hands of those who control the land (new / as entrepreneurs / as directly
Small linked / as the multinationals), but in the hands of these / as / as entrepreneurs / as
contractors, who are hired / as tens in each agribusiness company. This
Thus, the agribusiness company, which effectively uses the workforce provided by the
contrastista company in form does not have any / a worker /, and that the release of the
obligation to guarantee the most basic labor rights such as unionization or
own social benefits of a large company. Hence insecurity, low wages,
unworthy and unhealthy working conditions are the norm in the agricultural economy.
In addition to the exploitation of agricultural labor, agribusiness companies increased the
predatory exploitation in the fruit, forestry and livestock areas, particularly from
the mega poultry and pork business
Between 1990 and today intesificación process of agrarian counter-reform starts,
depriving workers of agro rights that although precariously,
They are still in place for workers in other economic sectors. By
eg / as temporary / employees / as Fruit today do not have the right to
Collective negotiation.

2. 3

To make matters worse, in recent years he began landing in Chile of transnational
GM seeds Monsanto, whose impact will be analyzed in section sovereignty
food.
In short, the reality created by neoliberal capitalism in the Chilean agriculture can be summarized
in four events:
- High concentration of land in a few companies, some of them belonging to
transnational capital and many others closely linked to it.
- High precariousness and labor exploitation as a result of even more extreme in the
agribusiness own employment conditions vulnerability of neoliberalism
- No land use sustetable
- Penetration of GM
Overcoming capitalism, as proposed this alternative government, demand attack
necessarily the reality created in Chilean agriculture. To this end, we propose the
democratic and revolutionary recovery of our country. And this process, which will start
the first month in office, we call "new agrarian reform".
The New Agrarian Reform will be implemented through the following measures:
a) Transfer of land from agribusiness companies to practice or encourage the
precarious work and outsourcing to workers
b) Development of popular control of production in agribusiness
c) Creation of an incentive fund for the integration of small farms and smallholdings in
land to agribusiness sector under popular control.
d) Organization of agricultural production to ensure food safety, not profit
private.
e) constitutional ban on the cultivation and marketing of GM seeds and products
f) Creation of a united Latin American market for agricultural products, as a
alternative to the global market.

24

With these measures we will encourage the participation of workers in agriculture and
smallholders and owners of small farms and small players in the
process of making decisions on the fate of the field.
While the New Agrarian Reform develops, implement policies to cushion
the worst effects of job insecurity in agriculture and the exclusion of his players
decision making process. These transitional measures will be suspended once
meets the process and agribusiness is under popular control.
Transitional measures are:
a) Linking demand for food from the state to offer local producers.
b) Design specific training and employability plans for landless field
agricultural workers.
c) Regulate and monitor seasonal agricultural work, gradually replacing the
contractor employment cooperatives.
d) Develop a national plan of financing for peasant family agriculture,
contemplates a unique banking system for small / as / as farmers / as with low
interest rate for the purchase of machinery and agricultural equipment.

10. Towards the sovereignty and food security
The new organization of agro we propose is one of the cornerstones of
our project: sovereignty and food security. We organize our
our economy in general and agriculture in particular for Chile to take
Decisions on how, how much and under what conditions produce food independently,
without the pressures of the international market of food or large corporations
seeds or other staples.
To ensure food sovereignty, we will implement the following measures:
a) constitutional ban on sale and planting of genetically modified seeds or products and
monoculture
b) Generate a traditional seed bank that is public and access

25

c) Create a subsidy for growing traditional seeds
d) Coordinate with the countries of the region a policy of safeguarding food sovereignty
regional

11. The Tax Reform
Much of the gross inequality that exists in Chile has its source in the system
tax created and perfected by 40 years of neoliberal governments. Theoretically, it is a
system designed to "encourage investment". In practice, however, is a
enrichment mechanism for large companies and their owners and homeowners. The
tax revenue is actually supported by the / as contributors / common ace and current and
by / as consumers / as, which account for ¿?% of tax funds to pay VAT. The
which in theory should be large taxpayers have a legal instrument evasion: the
FUT, which according to various estimates, has allowed those large taxpayers stop
pay $ 200 billion dollars since 1985.
In previous accumulation regimes, such as the late capitalism of the welfare state, the
tax system was a mechanism for transferring resources from major groups
income to the lower income groups. The Chilean tax system operates the way
opposite. All and all Chilean Chilean no ability to hire law firms
tax experts bring the Treasury 19% of the value of each product we buy.
A segment also pay as much of their income through tax second
category. But in theory and should be major contributors with resources
managed enough to tax legal services, pay VAT and nothing else. And if
off, from the state close to $ US30 million project resources
carry out feasibility studies for investments through various programs CORFO.
That avoids wasting the Treasury bienganadas them their profits. Who funds these millions
dollars? All of us and all of us paying VAT. This tax system, so
therefore it operates as a mechanism to transfer resources from groups with lower
income to higher-income groups.
And the icing on the cake: the VAT, being an indirect tax, is regressive, affecting more
proportion to the lower income groups.
Our government will undertake a major tax reform to avoid this trasvasije of
resources from low-income sectors towards higher income. Three will be
its pillars:
a) will remove the FUT

26

b) gradually will eliminate VAT. His first collection was removed in products
basic basket. Then associated with fundamental rights. And so on until
reach "zero tax" in the course of three governments of the popular movement.
c) will increase gradually, year by year, the first category tax to 33%.
d) will post a luxury tax of 60%
This tax reform will allow us not only to finance the recovery of our rights.
It will also, and this is critical to address the root of the main sources of
economic concentration and inequality in Chile.

27

II. Send the people

1. Focusing on the political system: the oligárquiconepótico regime and state centralist
The shameful and impoverished political system that Pinochet forces and their partners
Concertación in Chile have been installed until today two political consequences
harmful to the development of democracy: the concentration of power and the kidnapping of
popular will, which are two sides of the same coin.
Today in Chile both phenomena are manifested in two areas: the concentration in the system
representation and territorial concentration.

1.1 The focus on the representation system
Democracy, which should be "government of the people" in Chile actually operates as a
"Oligarchy", the government of a small number of "representatives". In a democracy
people command and obey the authorities. But in Chile the opposite occurs: a small
oligarchy makes and breaks without the holder of sovereignty, the people can exercise.
An important part of the "oligarchic" of Chilean politics has its origin in the extreme
"Partisanship" of institutions. The political system has generated all kinds of barriers
access to other forms of organization or distinct "political parties' participation. Between
those barriers is the binomial, but not confined to it. It is also number 7
Article 57 of the constitution, which prohibits union leaders (including and
union) and neighborhood leaders run for the chamber or Senate. And those obstacles still
should be additional barriers for the nomination of candidates not sponsored by a party
and a system of electoral financing tailored to candidates aligned with the
interests of big business.
With access barriers, the political system ensures complete monopoly supporter
elected positions. And that has a direct impact on the composition and
functioning of public institutions, as the main authorities, directories and / or
tips so central to national life and the Supreme Court institutions,
Constitutional Court, the Public Ministry, the Central Bank, the Public Defender,
National Television, among others, are wholly or partly elected by parliament, which in
turn is 99% controlled by the bureaucracies of the duopólicos parties. Institutions

28

public, in this way, they have become appendages of the party system and thus, in
guarantors of impunity.
In turn, the duopólicos parties, who, usurping the popular sovereignty, have captured
appropriating public institutions through parliament, are the spoils of cliques,
controlling the partisan bureaucracies, fill the lists of candidates with
cousins, brothers, cuñaditos, daddies, nephews ... Every time a party dynasty
done with the leadership of a party, filled all our institutions of representation
popular with their names: the Frei Ruiz-Tagle, the Walker, the Viera Gallo-Chadwick, the
Chadwick Piñera-the-Matte Larrain, the Latorre-Rincon, the Piñera, the Lagos-Escobar-WeberDurán, the Aylwin, the Rossi, the Puccio, the Alvear-Wormwood-Martinez, the van Rysselberghe, the
Girardi, the Enriquez-Ominami, the Sabbath, the Coloma, the Larrain ... In what constitutes a
national shame, the Chilean oligarchy a while since it has become an oligarchy
nepótica.
This particular form of organization of power has a direct impact on what is what
It has reduced the exercise of citizenship and political rights in Chile: the act of voting. The
and women parliamentarians, mayors and mayors, the councilors and Chile
They are not elected and elected in voting. They are appointed and designated by the parties before,
which in turn, as mentioned, they have been appropriated from small
bureaucracies that make decisions within four walls and generally in favor of their
amiguis kindreds and intimate. This is the operational dynamics of the Chilean political system: a pair
of families control the party bureaucracies, and they control an entire game; through
that control nominate their candidates and ready affair ended. When they reach the
voting process, you're all cooked. With our vote we not dirimimos nothing.
In practice, everything stated in the preceding paragraphs has come together in the development of a
particular type of political regime: the oligarchic-dynastic regime. Far from what happens in
a democratic republic in Chile today govern small groups of families thanks to
having appropriated bureaucracies duopólicos parties.
Against this oligarchic-dynastic regime in the Republic propose that the People
Manda.

1.2 The territorial concentration and centralist state
The second side of the political rally in Chile is the political-territorial, which has been
produced by growing capital monopolization of political decisions and riches
produced by regions.

29

The centralized state is not an invention of neoliberal capitalism. Chile, like other
the countries of the region, inherits the "centralist tradition" of the political organization of the colony,
that concentrated in the metropolis all decision-making power over the fate of the territories
overseas. This political dynamic is replicated in each of the colonial políticoterritoriales units: the cities and remote areas were required capital cities
to comply with and implement decisions taken in their respective political centers.
With the successive transformations of the State, the ways in which it materializes centralism
political substantially mutated. The same political centralism, however, has
remained intact. At present, the main authorities of each of the 15
regions are designated by the central government. The same applies to the political and
budget allocations: all are defined in the currency and ministries in Santiago.
This political centralism, also in Chile is powered by economic centralism: part
important of GDP generated in the regions is capitalized at Santiago. As a result,
wealth concentrated in the metropolitan region and poverty is distributed in the regions
produced.
Against political-territorial concentration of centralist state, we propose the State
autonomy as a first step toward the dissolution of state power in society.

2. The republic where the people rule: fundamentals
The popular movement has proclaimed Roxana Miranda as its candidate
President proposes to replace the oligarchic-dynastic regime and the centralized state today
force in Chile by a system of popular government and an autonomous state. We understand
by "system of popular government" a form of political organization in which the people
commands. And we mean by autonomous state a way to organize the State in which the
processes of political decision-making on a regional territory take place in the territory
itself and not in the capital. In this section we explain what we mean when
We proclaim that people send. Below we explain our proposal of the State
Autonomy.
Well, "the people send" far from a simple slogan, is the concept that synthesizes
all our project of a new regime and a new political system for Chile. Where he
people rule, political power is exercised by the majority through
instruments of popular power. This is a conception of power politician who
radically opposed to that underlying the current regime. If in the latter
companies and authorities in charge and the people obey, in the political system that we propose,
on the contrary, the people rule and the authorities and economic organizations obey.

30

In a republic where the people are in charge, the responsibilities of government are not vested in
oligarquizadas minorities who paid with public funds, actually work for the big
Capital, as clearly demonstrated in the shameful case of thermoelectric
AES Gener Campiche installed. Unlike. The institutions of popular representation is
subordinate institutions and decision dynamics of organized people, of which the
Popular assemblies are the main permanent and deliberation that takes place in
her breast.
The Permanent People's Assemblies are the instrument par excellence of the people's power and
self-government of the people. Where they operate, representative institutions, executive
and legislative, are administrators and executors of popular will. But decisions
about which policies are run and how to perform the sovereign people. In the republic
where the people rule, people's power is the fourth power and leads supervigila
other branches of government.
During the first four years in office the popular movement will be created,
They installed and put into operation Permanent Popular Assembly in each of the
national, regional and municipal levels: political-territorial levels. Their responsibilities, depending
the political-territorial level, will include functions ranging from creating laws to
policy formulation, implementation and enforcement.
The development of instruments of popular power will be accompanied by the institutionalization of
popular control over representative bodies, which will be effective through the
own electoral procedures system of representative government. Three mechanisms
election of popular control be put in place between 2014 and 2018:
a) All branches of government, including the Supreme Court, will be directed by
authorities elected through popular, universal, open elections and
competitive. The same applies to the main autonomous public institutions:
Constitutional Court, the Public Ministry, the Defender of the People of Chile or
Public Defender.
b) Any elected through popular vote authority shall be subject to revocation
mandate. Every withdrawal of mandate made solely through
popular vote, which take the form of recall referendum organized by 5%
minimum standard of the electoral unit in which exercises authority to revoke. It was revoked one
absolute mandate for revocation majority.
c) Compulsory Primary shaping lists where the number of stakeholders and
Interested exceed the number of seats available.

31

3. The political-territorial decentralization: the autonomous Chile
To end the political-territorial concentration of political power, we will transform
Chile in an autonomous state. The regime of autonomies, which applies in Spain and Italy, is
a form of political-territorial organization of the state that is midway between
centralized unitary state and a federal state. It allows each region to be established as
an autonomous political unit, but still leaving some important political functions
hands of the central government, especially in matters of defense, foreign policy and collection
prosecutor.
As in the States, the autonomous regions make up your system
executive, parliamentary and judicial. Defining therefore its policies of economic development and
production, safety, employment autonomously and political institutions
own region and not in Santiago.
For Chile, this autonomous system has some significant advantages over
federalism. With a hard-nosed federal system, disadvantaged regions, which often
being the most isolated, they accentuate its economic disadvantage, political and territorial
relative to the other, which in turn enhances its advantages. With an autonomous regime,
Instead, the central government can use fiscal resources to stimulate productive activities and
the development of regions lagging behind. The important thing is that autonomous regime
allows regions are themselves who, based on regional analysis, designing and
implement their own policies.
Our proposal, ultimately, is to create an autonomous Chile, which allow regions
They govern themselves instead of being governed from Santiago. That means that each region
You will elect their mayors, which will be renamed Governors; will elect
a regional parliament, which will have regional legislative function; They elect their judges and
judges, responsible for regional judiciary; and will form a regional people's congress
permanent, to regulate and monitor the functioning of other regional powers.
In the autonomous Chile, all regional development policies will be implemented by the
regional governments, with appropriate fiscal transfers from the central government and the
popular control of the executive and legislative efforts.
And what's more important: the principles of regional organization of the State
constitute the political and legal basis for the creation of autonomous indigenous territories
(TIA), where the native peoples of Chile will develop its political and social life
according to their customs.

32

4. The process: the social constituent assembly
Build a republic where the people command and autonomous State through
more democratic and legitimate process possible: the Social Constituent Assembly. Why
the most democratic and legitimate as possible? The constituent processes can be classified according
different criteria. They may be "legitimate" if started as a result of the incumbent's
power, people, or "illegitimate" if they are not the result of that mandate and, on the contrary, appear as
result of an infringement of its sovereignty. They are "oligarchic" if only allow access and
participation of a minority, and "democratic" if they involve the active and participatory contest
the majority. It will be "original" if it is not tied to other existing constitutional system, and
"Derivative" if owes its purpose, mission and constitutional legitimacy to an order made
previously.
A constitution is so crucial in the life and development of a people oligarchies
always blocked popular participation in its formulation. Through mechanisms
exclusive and minority, create constitutions that protect their interests and
safeguard their privileges. And, in most cases, they are successful in that purpose.
Few constitutions in the world that have been drafted and legitimately
democratic, with active participation of majorities and popular mandate. The major part
It has been made through one of these oligarchic mechanisms:
- Fees: small group of citizens (almost never female) who are
appointed by those in power, generally in an authoritarian and illegitimate. his
representativeness and legitimacy is zero. There is mandated holder of sovereignty,
people to create, on their behalf, a constitutional text. Of all the possible forms of
create a constitution, this is the most contrary to democracy and the principle of sovereignty
popular.
- Parliaments: some constitutions are created by parliaments in the exercise, which are
comprised of "representatives", ie minority with high levels of
oligarchization. These parliaments incur a contradiction and a usurpation. In a
contradiction because agents are simultaneously constituted power and power
constituent, which at least is a source of conflict of interest; a constitution
legitimate and democratic can not be drawn up by parties with a direct interest in the
current political and institutional system. And in a usurpation because parliaments are
elected with a specific mandate which, as a rule, does not include that of naming themselves
constituent power. The latter, the constituent power, to be legitimate can only emerge
the direct mandate of the holder of sovereignty, the people. Any organ of society
it bills itself as constituent power without a direct mandate from the people commits an act of
artful usurpation of popular sovereignty.

- Proto-parallel assemblies or parliaments: the name of "assembly usually applied
constituent "a body composed of ombudsmen personeras defined and defined in a
33

electoral process and have the mandate to draft a constitutional text. They formed a power
constituent can be considered legitimate, since the mandate it received from the people themselves to
through electoral delegation. But, rather than as an assembly in the strict sense of
term function as a parliament: a minority elected, who, on behalf of the people,
"Representing it" assumes constituents roles. In practice, therefore, these so-called
"Constituent assembly" parliaments are temporarily operate in parallel with
consecrated by the parliaments constituted power. While the latter legislated, the
first create a constitution. But the political logic of operation is the same: they are
minorities acting on behalf of the people, representing it, but without the participation or contest
the people themselves. Therefore, oligarcas and replicated dynamic characteristic of a minority
Parliament but constituents in making decisions. Trying to emulate the logic
deliberative assembly, fail to fully operate as one. They can be called
therefore proto-assemblies constituents.
The "Social Constituent Assembly" or simply "Democratic Constituent Assembly", to
Unlike the three previous procedures, it is one in which the constitution is drafted
through the deliberation of the whole society. The deliberation process takes place in each
one of the levels of social and political-territorial organization, from the neighborhood committee and others
grassroots to the national level, through the district and region.
Deliberation in each level is a development phase of the entire process. On completion of an
phase, organizational units define their delegates to act in
spokespersons in the discussion that will occur in the political-territorial level
immediately above. And so on until the formation of a large Assembly
Social Constituent national level is composed of spokespersons who have gone
all the constitutional process in each political-territorial level.
Of deliberation in the latter and more general political-territorial level comes the final version of
constitutional text to be submitted for approval by the people of Chile through a
binding referendum.
The entire process, from the deliberation in the grassroots organizations to
great national Constituent Assembly Social, results generated a Constitution
through active participation and deliberation of the majority. And this is precisely what
that unlike a conventional Constituent Assembly as proposed other
candidates: in the latter drafting the constitution it is delegated to constituents
elected / as. It is, therefore, the result of a decision by a tiny minority. The
Social Constituent Assembly, however, is the result of deliberation of all
society. Constituent becomes subject to every student, every citizen and
citizen, every resident and settler, every working man and woman.

3. 4

We understand this mechanism as the most democratic, inclusive and equitable as possible. Is,
also guarantee that the Constitution will not be the object of kidnapping
popular sovereignty by minorities.
Launch a Social Constituent Assembly as follows:
a) We will call a referendum for the people of Chile manifest
mainly on starting the constitutional process. Thus, there will be doubt
any constituent on the majority will of the people of Chile.
b) We will invite all social and political forces to participate in the development of the
call the Social Constituent Assembly, which will be done through executive decree. his
regulations and operating rules will be contained in the decree. a condition
negotiable: the Social Constituent Assembly will be original or not.
c) The constitutional deliberation will take place in five political-territorial levels of form
straight: just finished the next one starts. Levels in ascending order of
hierarchy are:
* Neighborhood councils and grassroots organizations
* Commune
* District
* Region
* National
d) Upon completion deliberation in each level, and will develop a constituent
proposed constitutional text and appoint their delegates who will defend
in the political-territorial next level.
e) The whole process of Social Constituent Assembly will have a term of three years to write
a new constitution. The first two will be dedicated to the constituent deliberation
subnational political-territorial levels. The past year will be dedicated to the discussion
Social Constituent Assembly in nationwide.
f) The resulting constitutional text will be submitted to ratification by referendum, title
per share.

35

g) Completed the consultation process will be effective the first constitution
prepared in a democratic and legitimate way in Chile.

5. electoral revolution
In the republic in which the people rule to start building since March
2014, political power is exercised by the majority through the instruments of power
popular. But people power is no substitute for representative bodies; puts under its
monitoring and control. That democratization of political power is based. Nevertheless,
for a total democratization of the political power, representative bodies should
be made through the democratic processes possible. Today in Chile there
there are democratic electoral rules of the election of officers.
One of the main reasons for the lack of democracy in the election of officers is
basal electoral system: the binomial system. However, there are many more factors
hinder the development of a democratic electoral competition, as barriers to entry,
uneven financing parties and candidates and the usurpation of the people's will
part of the bureaucracies of the parties. Thus, the single substitution of a system
election for another is not sufficient for a democratization of the electoral rules. They
It requires a profound transformation of all the rules of electoral competition and
base their doctrine. In short, it requires an electoral revolution.

5.1 Electoral systems in Chile
In Chile there are four electoral systems:
- A majority system of absolute majority for the election of President *
- A majority system of relative majority for the election of mayors
- A simple proportional system for the election of councilors
- A binomial system for the election of deputies / senators and deputies / senators
Of these four systems, the first three meet the explicit or manifest function of all
electoral system: allocation of seats according to their formulas and criteria. The binomial,
meanwhile, as most electoral systems regulating competition
Parliament also meets the implicit or latent function of structuring the system

36

games. Therefore, it can be considered as the baseline and key electoral system
the Chilean political system.
For the allocation of seats, the binomial is a very peculiar type of system
election. In each district or constituency has a fixed number of seats in dispute: both.
Each list competing for seats, therefore, can have up to a maximum of two
candidates / ace. To assign seats, the votes of the / as members of each list are added.
The two lists with the largest number of votes scored by its members are left with the two
seats. But if the list with the most first sum a number of votes equal to the
least twice the votes of the second, it is with both seats. This is known
called "dubbing." As in most of the major systems, "dubbing" allows
the possibility of a "take all", that one of the lists is left with all the representation
district or constituency without the possibility of distributing seats with other forces.
Regarding the structure of the party system, the binomial has created a structure
unique in the world. In Chile there are at least 5 games capable of running with 10% or
more of the vote in a given election. That, in another electoral system, enough to create a
multiparty system. But the binomial, by the nature of the electoral competition
institutes, pressure on these five forces (plus any others you want to go to play in the
greater electoral leagues) are grouped into two, and only two viable blocks. Some games
They can try the way of the third option, as, indeed, did the Communist Party and
other more minority forces. But competition makes viable binomial two and
just two political alternatives. In this way, manages to square the circle:
forcing a fragmented to concentrate forces in two blocks system, it makes a system
that otherwise it would have formed a multiparty structure behave in
practice as a two-party system. And all the properties of a two-party system
"Pure" (composed of two games) apply to an "impure" bipatidista system as created
by the binomial. The Chilean party system, thanks to the binomial is a centripetal system
criminalizing polarization and requires coalitions to block or not to give the center
political.

5.2 Limitations of the binomial
The binomial system has been extensively studied and analyzed. And there is relative consensus
and its major limitations and flaws. Overall, we can say that
It combines the main defects of majoritarian systems and proportional systems:
1. The binomial excluded from political representation to major political forces.
2. Related to the previous default, the binomial allows parties with important
vote but outside the two dominant coalitions obtain fewer seats (if

37

is that obtained) that parties with less votes but are part of one of the
dominant coalitions. And this is a major distortion of the popular will.
3. The binomial, with the current redistricting, violates a fundamental principle of
representation: the equivalence of the vote. Deputies of some districts must
represent a number between 2 and 10 times more voters than other districts. In the
last parliamentary election, for example, 40,961 electors of District 59
(Aysén) chose the same two representatives and that 241,446 voters and
District 20 voters (Cerrillos, Central Station and Maipu). Therefore, in terms of
representation, each district vote of 59 equates to about 6 times the voting
District 20. That is, by combining the binomial and distritaje currently in force,
Today in Chile there are votes that are worth more and votes that are worth less.
4. The main virtue of the majority system par excellence, the uninominal, is absent in the
binomial: it is not a competitive system. The two seats being contested in each district or
constituency and the high demand for the "take all" (dubbing of votes) makes the
the ruling parties and coalitions with one / a candidate / a competitive / a per list. From
Otherwise, one / to the / as two candidates / as strong would be lost. As the two main
political blocs have high certainty that at least one / a of its candidates / as
end with seat, has become integrated binomial rule lists a / a candidate / a
strong or "protected / a", which is virtually assured with quota, and a candidate / a feeble that
it goes to slaughter. This, in practice, results in little or no competition between lists. At
best, competition ends up producing between candidates / as the same
list. But there is no dispute or competition among candidates / lists as contrary, competition
which, presumably, is one of the main virtues of an electoral process against other
ways of defining rulers.
5. From the hand of the poor competitiveness is the low possibility of accountability. As
The list is compiled by coalitions and / as candidates / as winners / as practically
are defined / as by negotiation between parties even before the election, the vote is a
mere ritual that has no power to punish or reward. The process of defining
the representative or has no place in the election, but in negotiations between bureaucracies
partisan. And with that, the binomial loses one of the main virtues of a system
majority: let the punishment or reward through voting.

5.3 Other limitations of the Chilean electoral system
The binomial is a serious obstacle to the creation of representative bodies
democratic. But he's not the only one. In Chile there is an important regulatory system
system barriers to electoral competition that violates one of the rights
fundamental political: the right to be elected / a. The most important barriers are:

38

1. Numeral 7 of Article 57 of the constitution, which prohibits union leaders (including
the union and) and neighborhood leaders apply for the camera or Senate.
2. Title I of the Constitutional Act on Election and Vote Count, which
enables "declare candidacy" only political parties, their covenants or / as
independent who meet a number of signatures equal to 0.5% of the voting pattern in the
last election.
3. The absence of legislation that guarantees and requiring gender parity on lists
4. The lack of legislation to ensure equal representation of the peoples
originating
5. unsustainable inequality of economic resources and access to media
from parties and candidates.
A simple modification of the electoral system leaves intact these obstacles. Is not sufficient,
thus change the binomial by another system. It is also essential to transform all
these regulations. We need therefore, an electoral revolution

5.4 The Electoral revolution in doctrine
The electoral legislation now in force is to a particular conception doctrinal basis of the
politics and society: the unionist ideology. For this ideology, society must
contaminated as little as possible "political". "Intermediate bodies" should only pursue
sectoral targets, "union".
According to the unionist ideology, the politicization of society is avoided if some / as few / as
citizens / as make the sacrifice of giving up the personal self and engage in
public service professional, stable, regular basis. But the rest of society can not
politicized. Hence the great barriers that current regulation imposes for
citizens / or as independent social leaders make the leap to the competition for power
political. The obstacles to the democratization of the electoral competition, in short, is a
reflection of the fundamental principles of the unionist ideology.
Given the above, modify or repeal the electoral system either standard are just
palliatives and insufficient to combat the lack of democracy in competition
public charges. For deep and radical democratization is fundamental refound
All democratic electoral system on doctrinal grounds other than those

39

current. Only after that the changes in the electoral system or the modification of
rules will lead to greater democratization.
Implement an electoral revolution for the electoral system is governed by
following principles:
a) People's Sovereignty. The electoral system has as its first and primary purpose do
effective, as closely as possible the popular will in the election of officers, the
exercise of self-government and revocation of authorities and representatives. "Ensuring
political stability "or similar system can only be pursued in the system
electoral whether the principle of popular sovereignty is guaranteed first and the others are listed
continuation
b) Representation. Every citizen and every citizen has the right to representation in the
legislative and executive, and across political-territorial level powers. Participation or not in pacts
or electoral coalitions can not alter the right to citizen preferences are
represented as closely as possible in the organs of popular representation.
c) Eligibility. Undergoing elective any charges can be defined by
election procedures. That includes ministers of the Supreme Court and members of the
constitutional Court.
d) Equivalence. The electoral system ensure that all votes have the same
value and equal representation. It will be designed in the most flexible way possible so that
electoral units can adjust to demographic changes in the country.
e) Parity. The electoral system ensure that all the lists in all elections
for elected office, including candidates equal amount of gender
male and female.
f) Revocability. All elective office may be subject to revocation through
election procedures.
g) Plurinationality. The electoral system ensure the presence in each list
competition in the same proportion of candidates from indigenous peoples that the proportion of
population of native peoples in the electoral unit for which it competes.
h) Equity. The electoral system will guarantee equal access to financing
campaigns and spaces in written press, radio, television and digital media for all
political and social organizations that compete in elections.

40

i) Plurality. The electoral subject is political parties. But the electoral system
ensure the electoral expression of other forms of organization of society. The
territorial organizations may be established at the community, regional or national level to
dispute seats in each level. Organizations with authority level to contest seats
subnational are established by merger or union of social organizations.
j) majority: the absolute majority principle applies in the presidential election and
governors / regional ace, and the principle of relative majority in the elections of mayors and
mayors.
k) Proportionality: the simple proportionality principle will be applied in elections
national parliamentarians, regional parliamentary and in municipal councils

5.5 The revolution in the electoral system
Based on the new electoral doctrine, Roxana Miranda's government sent a draft
law to parliament to re completely the Chilean electoral system. Saying
order will be issued in an Electoral Code with the following standards:
a) The territorial electoral organizations may be subject. They will operate the
follows:
- A communal political organization is generated by the binding of 25% of organizations
territorial (neighborhood). This condition may present candidates
election of councilors and mayors.
- A district political organization is generated by the union of political organizations
communal 25% of the communes of a district. This condition may present
candidates for deputies elections.
- A regional political organization is generated by the union of political organizations
district 50% of the districts of a region. This condition may present
gubernatorial candidates / as parliamentarians and regional / ace.
b) To ensure effective representation, each candidate must register
residence in the electoral unit in which it competes for at least two years old
c) The number of deputies and deputies of the unicameral Assembly and the parliaments
regional will be variable. It will depend on the turnout in each electoral unit.

41

d) The unicameral national parliament, regional parliaments and municipal councils
They choose a simple proportional electoral quotient (D'Hondt).
e) To ensure proportionality, districts will remain as found in the
today. But seats will be allocated according to the following criteria:
- Districts of up to 100,000 (100,000) in the last election voters can choose to
three (3) Members / as
- Districts with between 100,000 and one (100,001) and 200,000 (200,000) voters in the last
choice may choose up to six (6) Members / as
- Districts with between 200 thousand and one (200,001) and 300,000 (300,000) voters in the last
choice can choose up to eight (8) members / as
- Districts with more than 300 thousand and one (300,001) voters in the last election may
choose up to ten (10) deputies / as
f) and members of regional parliaments will be chosen with the following criteria:
- Communes of up to 15 thousand (15,000) voters in the last election may choose to
four (4) Members / as regional
- Municipalities with between 15 thousand and one (15,001) and 50,000 (50,000) voters in the last
choice may choose up to six (6) Members / as regional
- Municipalities with between 50 thousand and one (50,001) and 100,000 (200,000) voters in the last
choice can choose up to eight (8) members / as regional
- Municipalities with over 100 thousand and one (100,001) voters in the last election may
choose up to ten (10) deputies / as regional
g) The election of councilors will be held following the current proportional rules.
h) The Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court shall be elected through a system of scrutiny
plurinominal majority. In each case, each elector may vote for up to three
candidates. They shall be elected who obtain the most votes.
i) For the election of presidents and governors a system of absolute majority is applied.
j) For the election of mayors relative majority system is applied.

42

k) a mandate to be revoked absolute majority in favor of revocation.
l) In each election lists must conform respecting gender quotas and towns
originating the principles established in the new electoral system:
- 50% of the lists (or the nearest number in case of odd numbered lists) must
be integrated by women
- Each list must consist of a proportion of candidates and / or candidates
indigenous peoples proportional to the population of each indigenous people in the unit
disputed election. To calculate the ratio, the latest projections will be used
population calculated by the responsible official statistics body.

6. Armed Forces for the Republic in which the people rule
War and military force, with varying degrees of development, are not capitalist phenomena.
They have existed in all forms of social organization of production and therefore more or
less important, in the history of mankind, including those early societies
classless primitive communism. For this reason, the defeat of capitalism will not end
the armed forces. Unlike. It will require your competition to protect the popular project
and reactions against capitalist restructuring attempts. A military problem
republic in which the people send is not to end the armed forces, but put them at
service and under the control of the organs of popular power. That is an important
reorientation and reorganization of the defense system and some of its main
institutions. Roxana Miranda's government will take the first steps in that direction. 11
March 2018 will set the foundations for progress towards a system of defense
led by the popular power.
The defense system controlled and directed by the popular power is a doctrine
opposed to the doctrine of national security defense force today. Their bases are:
- The defense system is subordinate to the organs of popular power
- The defense bodies respect the fundamental principle that use physical force
monopolized by the State against the people itself constitutes high treason and the most severe of
military crimes
- The defense policy is an integral part of policy and international relations
peoples. It is not independent of it but, on the contrary, is subordinate to it.

43

- The defense, especially the part constituted by the military, is an instrument of
popular project protection against attacks of global capital and the States which
They support and promote. And it has an important role in civil aid of the population
conditions of natural disasters and assistance in remote areas.
- Just as capitalism and its imperialist war instruments act globally, the
Similarly the task of protecting and safeguarding the popular project beyond the scope of
territory and national institutions of a nation. This requires the development of a system
regionally and globally integrated defense to block resistance to capitalism. The
creating an integrated defense system, with the participation of all peoples
resistance against capitalism, is the only guarantee of receipt of each
popular national projects and / or regional.
- The establishment of officials and professional officers of the defense is the basis of
defense system of the people of Chile. Therefore, this, the defense system should
ensure their physical and psychological integrity. To neutralize risks in the performance of tasks
own defense, makes extensive use of technological resources.
- The establishment of officials and professional officers of the defense are an instrument
the people who govern themselves. Shares therefore their becomings. It is not a caste
special privileges. Village officials and professionals and officials of defense,
Consequently, they share the same rights and duties (from the tax until the
health rights), the same pension system, and in peacetime, the same
justice institutions.
- The defense institutions are disciplined, hierarchical, meritocratic. But in a
defense system under the control of people's power, the hierarchy structure is open to
access to all officials and all officials with the necessary merits to choose
each range. Not operate in them, therefore, no segregating mechanism
caste generate inside. All senior ranks, including generals, are
Open the rise of any member of the military body that meets the merits
military, and only military enough.
- The military court, whose jurisdiction justice is given to the establishment of
officials and officials of the defense, you can only operate in times or conditions
war, declared by the organs of popular power under the Constitution issued by the
Social Constituent Assembly. Under no circumstances may usurp the jurisdiction of the
ordinary courts judging civil citizens. And the crimes committed by
Uniformed and / or uniform in times of peace or situations should be judged by
ordinary courts.
- The defense system that is subordinate to the organs of popular power applied as
base all their actions unconditional respect for the human rights of the people. That
44

It assumes that its officers and NCOs are trained and trained intensively rights
humans.
- The defense system that is subordinate to the organs of popular power is a system
joint and equal in terms of gender. At all levels of the military hierarchy
will present women with the most deserving.
- The defense system that is subordinate to the organs of popular power is respectful and
inclusive of sexual diversity and gender identities. These, sexual diversity and
gender identities are understood as an institutional wealth. Therefore, they have thesame place in the system of defense that the other manifestations.
- The defense system that is subordinate to the organs of popular power is plurinational
and open to the participation and conduct of and the members of indigenous peoples who
meet the necessary military merits.
- The defense system that is subordinate to the organs of popular power does not allow the
installation of any basis of capitalist imperialism in Chile.
There are six measures that our government will move towards the creation of the system
defense described in the above lines:
a) Reform of the military courts to exercise jurisdiction only under the conditions
the extraordinary wartime duly declared by the People's Power.
b) Merger school official (Military School of Libertador Bernardo O'Higgins) and
non-commissioned officers (NCO School of the Chilean Army) to create a Military School
Unified Libertador Bernardo O'Higgins.
c) Reform of the military training curriculum to include the following contents:
- Human rights
- Gender equality, integration of sexual diversity and gender identities
- Regional integration
- Plurinationality
d) Implementation of a program of parity and gender equality in order to:

4. 5

- That each grade has a budget of at least between 10% and 25% of women under the
ranks and demand climbs.
- Create economic incentives for the incorporation of women into the forces
Navies
- Generate material conditions, infrastructure and institutional culture
encourage the development of a military career women equal
e) Implementation of the integration program of sexual diversity and identities
gender so that they can be exercised freely into all armed institutions.
f) Starting a defense system composed of the peoples of Latin America

7. A representative institutions as people power
The current representative institutions in Chile is tailored to the accumulation and
reproduction of political elites: state terrorism exercised against the social struggle and imposes
insurmountable barriers to political renewal. 73% of deputies and deputies
Acting now will reelection this November 17, and about a dozen
they and they'll re-election for the sixth consecutive time.
To make matters worse, the system of government to parliament deprived of a significant part of the
rightful functions develop: introduce bills. Or, in honor of the
accuracy, makes unnecessary any presentation of bills. Due to
hypertrophied Chilean presidential, presidential messages only become law.
The motions are successful only when regulate trivial aspects.
The latter not only makes urgent radical reform of presidentialism. Also it makes
necessary to create a more effective and functioning parliament. Therefore, we propose the creation of a
unicameral parliament and the gradual transition to parliamentarism.
Both reforms will move towards a popular government through devolution
of political power. The transition to parliamentarism allow break concentration
power of the presidential institution and unicameralism will eliminate one of the organs,
the Senate, which contribute to the concentration of power in the parliamentary institution. In others
terms, parliamentarism diluted important part of presidential power and unicameralism
diluted senatorial power.

46

The new unicameral parliamentary system will be supervigilado by the Permanent People's Congress
Consisting of spokespersons of social and national grassroots organizations.

8. Integration and anti-capitalist diplomacy of the peoples
Since 1973, the international relations of Chile have followed paths outside the
interests of the majority. Just consummated the coup of September 11, all the
not exempt diplomatic corps turned to the task of getting recognition and legitimacy
for the dictatorship. In this objective, reflecting no benefit to the interests
or national majorities, an important part of foreign policy wore until 1989.
Assumed the neoliberal governments of the agreement, the focus of relations
International changed significantly. Since 1990 the diplomatic corps turned to
the task of managing free trade agreements with the economies of the northern hemisphere. Is
It tasks it continued to play until 2010.
During the last government there was a further change in foreign policy. Sebastian Pinera
installed tried unsuccessfully protagonist and regional leader and replacing Alvaro Uribe,
He wanted to head the regional bloc pro-Washington. He led the recognition of Porfirio
Lobo; intensified efforts for the realization of "Pacific Agreement" with Colombia,
Mexico and Peru; and even had the luxury of supporting the Chilean Senate in its attempt to violate the
International Law "watching" (?) Venezuelan elections.
In none of these three foreign policies of conduction of Chile observed
international relations in the national interest or the majority. In the first case, the
foreign policy used with almost private purposes, for interest governing board. At
second case is the commercial interest of the great global capital protected. In the latter case,
foreign policy serves a mixture of ideological and narcissistic interests.
These 40 years of foreign policy against the interests of the majority have generated important
diplomatic problems for Chile and an unfavorable impact on national interests.
For starters, they have neglected relations with our neighbors, already complex, and
They have deteriorated to unimaginable points. Today Chile has been sued by two of its
three neighboring court of The Hague. For its part, the FTA signed by Chile have
proven to be disadvantageous to the national interest. This is true primarily in
the case of Chapter 17 of the FTA signed with the US, which regulates agreements
intellectual property.
Our government will end 40 years of foreign policy deficit. It refound our
international relations on a new basis:

47

a) We will change the basic doctrine of international relations practiced
Currently the State of Chile.
-

The new doctrine will have a different purpose: it will reorient foreign policy since the
signing FTAs ​​to building relationships of cooperation and integration for
overcoming capitalism.

-

The focus of these relations of cooperation and integration will not only States
offering favorable terms of trade, but states and peoples
led by popular and anti-imperialist governments. In other words, the new
foreign policy will be oriented towards management and good welfare conditions
living for the people of Chile, which is achieved with the emancipation of capitalism and its
global political instrument, imperialism.

-

In the new doctrine, international relations are not only the task of States,
but also of peoples and their organizations. Represent a matrix of relationships
multidimensional and it includes all actors in the struggle against capitalism. Are you
relations are between states but also between states and social organizations,
of course, between social organizations. In short, the foreign policy of peoples
Chile will be supported in international relations (between nations politically
organized), but also in what is known as "diplomacy of the peoples".

b) Change the target of international relations (the signing of FTAs ​​cooperation and
integration), is a different approach in the act of diplomatic agents.
Instead of maximizing their own utility agreements and trade agreements, new
relations maximize complementarity.
c) The new doctrine of international relations requires a deep reform and
modernization of the civil service training in diplomacy, creating a resume that
includes foundations of the new approach to foreign policy. The reform and modernization will help
the Diplomatic Academy Andrés Bello also finished putting your training program.

8.1 Mar to Bolivia
Bolivia's maritime claim has historically been interpreted by the Chilean government
as a viable alternative that threatens the integrity of the national territory. As the
Sea is the main subject of interest to Bolivia, our diplomatic agenda
neighbor has not had a glimpse of integration. More than three decades ago that we do not keep
diplomatic relations for more than eight not celebrate any agreement or treaty
addressing substantive bilateral issues in the interest of both countries.

48

For the region of Metro Manila, this situation creates significant externalities
economic, cultural and political. Arica is linked to the cultures of millennia areas
altiplano. Is the natural spa macrozone south-central Andean and an important part
of their resources from tourism and transport Bolivian overseas. Of total
Arica port operations during the first half of 2010, 71% was linked to
Bolivian trade. And in 2009, in terms of volume, Arica moved 1,778,623 tons, of
of which 1,356,937 corresponded to Bolivian cargo.
However, today we are far from the best of times. Between 1953 and 1973, the
terms of trade and integration with Bolivia had its peak. He settled in
Arica a significant number of Bolivians migrants due to the development of poles
industrial and commercial production associated with the free port. This process was not without
contradictions, but it was a clear demonstration that through territorial autonomy
and economic decentralization could work together on an agenda of mutual
growth.
These records show two things. First, another framework for relations with Bolivia
generating greater social, economic and cultural benefits to Arica. And second
Instead, that diplomatic relations between Chile and Bolivia are in the state of
deterioration due to the unwillingness of governments to resolve the main demand
our neighbor. When are the people who establish relationships, some of its
prospects.
Our government will address the maritime problem of Bolivia on the basis of learning
above background. It will serve the Bolivian demand not only as an approach
legitimate but necessary for regional integration. But what is most important: you
it will respond.
Bolivia sovereign access to deliver is a way to recover for the peoples of the Americas
a part of the sea that the neoliberal governments of the agreement have been delivered to the
exploitation of 7 families. Therefore, rather than a territorial loss, consider that a
Bolivia access to the sea constitutes a gain in popular sovereignty.
Consider two possible alternatives viable outlet to the sea for Bolivia:
a) The first alternative is a strip of land of varying size in the north of Arica,
but sufficiently large to accommodate a port and associated infrastructure
and services. This mega port should be located mostly in ceded lands
Chile, but to some extent also should give Peru a cloth, for strategic reasons.
The exclusive sovereignty of the territories in which the port will be located will be Bolivia.
b) The second alternative is an enclave of territorial sovereignty Chilean, Bolivian tripartite
Peruvian. It would become the first area of ​​their status in the Americas. A
49

administration of the governments of the three nations allow Bolivia had free access
the Pacific Ocean. They also would be a prop in regional integration.
Both alternatives will be negotiated with the Bolivian government to commit to
administer the territory from the perspective of popular sovereignty, and not with State criteria
or market.
The Bolivian maritime problem has a solution and is closer than you think. Alone
Needless vocation of integration and political will to move towards it. Our government
brings both. And a foreign policy that rests on the people's diplomacy

III. Recovery of our rights
One of the fundamental requirements of the functioning of capitalism is to turn everything
you can merchandise. Otherwise, if not economically exploited things that they had not been
exploited until then and just try to profit from the usual, the rate is reduced
gain. That is the result of a law of economics: the law of returns
decreasing.
The diminishing returns suggests that each additional unit of a new
productive factor generate additional profits under the old unit if the other
factors are held constant. As production factors in any economy are
limited, the consequence of the law is that there are inherent limits to growth
productivity and therefore also of profit, the "profit". In addressing a number of
factors in a territory, in a company, in an economic area, the additional production
he obtained from each unit of capital investment (with other factors constant) it is increasingly
less than the previous investment unit. Reaching a certain level of occupancy
factors, capital investment will be more profitable in another country, in another company, in another
economic category. Hence capital will expand into all areas of the
nature, society and the lives of people in a dynamic and unstoppable: required
always new items to ensure better operating profit rates. And so it is
and it ends up turning everything into a commodity, in order to profit. Or, as it says masterfully
the great Ana Tijoux:
Everything away, all they sold,
Everything is profiting, life-death
Everything is business, as you all
Seed pascuala, methods and choir.
Knowing this property detail of the laws of capital, and economists
dictatorship called the local and global financial capital to seize everything they could
society, the economy and the Chilean territory. And one of the things that took
It was our rights. The dictatorship, first, and consultation then delivered all
our most fundamental rights, from health to education, through the
pensions and housing, and mercanchiflero speculative capital, which has kidnapped and,
of course, you do not want to drop.
The kidnapping of our fundamental rights by capital not only has
become a commodity to be acquired in the market but, applying the golden rule
Capitalism get the most benefit at the lowest possible cost, it has devalued and,
Therefore, we devalue us and us as human beings. Today we have something like
rights guaranteed services or benefits of very poor quality but cost more
than any other country in the world.

51

And as if this situation is not in itself sufficient, when the people, the sovereign, is
organize and mobilize to recover their abducted rights is the subject of criminalization
and repression. Capitalism the way chielan therefore subjected to a double
violation: capital violates our rights to profit from them (get the most benefit
the lowest possible cost) and then the State protects the accumulation violated when we
repressed by fighting his abduction.
The third major objective of our government will be to attack and break this double breach. By
one side will create an institutional framework to protect the people of Chile for the violations and,
on the other, will regain our rights of kidnapping that are mired.

1. rights protection institutions
Capitalism knows the chilean way of dealing with a unique form of social protest.
criminalizándola. All fighter and all social activist knows firsthand how each
Chilean government used the repressive apparatus of the State, violating human rights
fundamental, contain clear and, if possible, to crush any resistance and
open confrontation against neoliberalism and the plunder of our resources.
Serious violations committed in Chile have begun to acquire more
public connotation thanks to the growing mobilization since 2006. The brutal form
penguins and pingüinas crackdown, students, workers, members and
supporters of environmental and regional organizations, among others, has become increasingly
Clearly there is a serious vacuum in Chile protection and safeguarding human rights
fundamental. It requires therefore an institutional with the strength and ability
enough to combat all forms of rights violations. We therefore propose the
creation of the Defender of the People of Chile.
All coalition governments since Patricio Aylwin to Bachelet, have
attempted to make noise with the creation of an Ombudsman's or, as he called Ricardo
Lagos, a 'Citizen Advocacy. " All of them, however, remained in the statement
intention. None of the bills sent to Congress for approval
They had urgency and, therefore, ended up sleeping the sleep of the just in some
small and without much significance 3 COMMISSION.

The ultimate was reached to establish was the Presidential Advisory Commission
Protection of Rights of Persons created in 2001. Worked as a
"Pilot" in the metropolitan area to assess its feasibility. But it was completed
deflate in January 2007 when Martha de la Fuente, its president, resigned in finding
lack of political will on the part of the incumbent government to boost the parliamentary process
He created the Ombudsman.
While the bombastic declarations of intent abounded in the last 24 years
State has established public institutions with specific missions that could be considered
a People's Defender own, as SERNAC or the Institute of Human Rights,
but no Ombudsman as such. The political calculus behind this is clear:
better to build an institutional defense of citizens scattered in
multiple weak, dependent and executive powers rather symbolic services
a single public institution that big, strong, autonomous and sufficient resources to
be a counterweight to the power of public services and corporations.
The absence of public institutions responsible for protecting the rights
key has started to feel with increasing intensity to the extent that
the conflict has grown Chilean society since 2006. Governments
Bachelet and Piñera government forces have used terror as a tool to discourage
mobilization. The constant complaints of open violations of fundamental rights in
police stations where students, environmentalists and other actors are mobilized give detainees
realize that the governments of the Concertación and the Alliance are willing to reach
limits of creating a human rights crisis rather than addressing and responding to the
demands of a mobilized society.
The growing violation of fundamental rights as practiced for decades in
Chile makes the creation of institutions to protect rights and popular defense
strong, independent and more than symbolic powers, an urgent political obligation. In
answers, the second as the government of Roxana Miranda held then
of course, to call a referendum to call a Constituent Assembly Social,
It will be sending a bill to the Parliament for the creation of the Ombudsman
Peoples of Chile.
The Defender of the People of Chile have 8 pillars:
a) It shall be an autonomous public institution with its own assets which will function
enforce and ensure respect for the fundamental rights established by the
constitution and laws.
b) have the powers to punish violations of those rights. In case of
Human Rights violations, officials may suspend forces
order or armed while the investigation is conducted. In the case of rights violations
53

consumer, may fine companies responsible. In the case of infringement of
rights of other public institutions, suspend officials and officials or,
failing that, the sanctions provided for in the constitution and laws.
c) You will also have the mandate to prosecute all acts that violate
basic and fundamental to name victims of rights violations.
d) Collect all the secretariats, national services and public institutions that have
function is the protection of fundamental rights of persons or warranty
access to those rights. It merged into a single institution to the following offices and
public agencies:
- Human Rights Institute
- National Consumer Service
- Human Rights Department
- Council for Transparency
A single institution responsible for protection against violation of rights, that is
strong and autonomous, it can better fulfill its mission of an institutional framework
multiple weak and dependent on public services authority.
e) He will also safeguard the rights of the hearings of citizens in their
information requests to public bodies, consumers and consumers against
the companies.
f) Have specialized units to combat the most pressing rights violations,
of the so-called "suspect category" violations against indigenous peoples,
against sexual diversity, violence and gender discrimination against
organizations and social actors who mobilize.
g) It will run for a Popular or People's Defender Defender elected by popular vote
for a period of eight years without the right to repostulación. His office, like all charges
elected, may be subject to revocation of mandate as established by the Code
Electoral de Chile. The candidates for the office and can not register any party militancy
politician in the years immediately preceding the nomination two years. This condition will
verified by the SERVEL.

54

h) To ensure effective autonomy, the budget of the Ombudsman in Chile
will be fixed in a game itself than in any budget management may be less than
0.35% of the national budget.

2. The right to just and dignified retirement
The current pension system was created by Jose Pinera. Its operating logic is
simple: all the money saved by workers and dependent workers in Chile
They should go to the "market" and not the State. In private hands, it becomes a fund
companies can use as new investments. These companies grow, so too,
Theoretically, worker savings grow.
The great global capital this seems a great idea. For example, the CEO of Metlife,
Steven Kandarian, recently bought AFP Provida. Why? For its investment committee will
He presented the acquisition of AFP at a cost of US $ 1,521 million. With this you can access
to reinvest the assets of Provida of US $ 46,000 million, a level related companies
Overall, obtaining fresh financing and low rates. That is, Mr. Kandarian purchase
And invests funds Provida Provida given in his other businesses that need

investments. Easy credit without bank interest and money from the workers!
But the AFP system not only funds to other areas of the economy with money
workers and benefit big economic groups. It is in itself a juicy business.
In recent years it has been the sector that has received greater benefits in Chile. At
first half of 2012, for example, achieved a 34% return, much higher than the
the already hefty profits of the Banking and Retail.
An important part of this superlative benefit is explained by the administration regime
Chilean pension created by neoliberal capitalism: the administrators have heritage
independent of individual capitalization funds of workers. He
Just because managing them by law to generate commissions and administrative expenses
Please AFP. No matter, therefore, that the improperly administered AFP
Funds: compulsive always receive payment (required by law) of its administrative services.
If funds lost profitability by mismanagement or economic crisis, it does not matter; the
Anyway AFPs charge their commission and administrative expenses. It is the only business
He profited even generate losses. And losses of own resources but the
resources workers and workers who administer.
The system generates overwhelmed enrichment AFPs economic and financial groups
they belong to, but pays pensions of misery that do not reach for the family
retirees are above the poverty line. Of the 900,000 pensions

55

currently paid, the average is $ 176,456 monthly. Averaging 500 thousand
$ 126,416 and $ 217,000 averaged 400,000 a month.
Retirees and retirees of the armed forces, which were not incorporated into the system
pension created by José Piñera and maintained a distribution system, receiving pensions 10
times higher.
In short, the pension system created by the Chilean neoliberal capitalism creates enormous
profits for economic and financial groups linked to them but, on average, pay
and close below the minimum wage to the poverty line pensions. More than a system
pension that guarantees a dignified old age, is a system of compulsory insurance, which forces
workers to give part of their salary to fund activities
large economic groups.
To ensure pension of 70% of what is perceived in the labor force, we propose a
solidarity distribution system financed on a tripartite basis by workers
(12%), businessmen and women (3%), and State (5%). In total, the new price will be
20% of salary. With that, the new pension system can finance pensions
close to 70% of the average salary of the last years of labor activity of a worker.
In addition to fair pensions, this system will generate a financially viable system up to
least 2030. During 2012 the pension system received 4.4 billion pesos annually
and of the contributors and 1.35 trillion of Treasury. However, of those 5.8 billion has only
paid 1.6 billion in annuities and 0.4 billion in premiums and disability.
That is, the system, after paying pension and insurance premiums, with a balance remains
Please 3.8 trillion, more than 50% of the total collected. At present, the balance in favor
finances investments of economic groups. With our reform, finance decent pensions
and fair, that will be universal. In other words, pensions will no longer be a business
and they shall become a law.

3. The right to housing and the city
We are constantly compared with the rest of Latin America because we are an example
quantity. But still think the efforts of organizations
mobilized by these needs for shelter and good location should concentrate on
the quality of construction, equipment, services and connectivity.
The right to housing has been legislated, regulated, and implemented in public policy,
by a subsidiary perspective, where the basic housing has evolved booth
health until the current permanent housing approximately 50m2; but promoting
production of habitat and / or involvement by families and communities, either
56

through ownership, management or execution, it is something that is considered secondary. Although
There are some exceptions, whom these full or partial funding is awarded,
left out of the design decisions, resource allocation, construction and location.
We make exceptions basic formality open spaces where
housing and community planning your habitat. In the case of home environment there
some Chilean experiences as the formation of CVD, alternative figure Boards
Neighbors allowing participation revitalize with new methodologies and requirements to be
part of local planning this space.
Regarding the right to the city have in our housing policy, with requirements
equipment that must accompany land location, especially in the case of
New Construction Land (CNT); However despite these demands,
land available for social housing are in the peripheral areas and extra
wall of our cities. The same logic is experienced in rural areas.
In this line we must understand and disseminate the legal procedures to manage from the
civil society policy improvements habitat, building a capable institutional support
constitutionally guarantee access to decent housing and land.
We imperative that the next government of popular movements to offer a
horizon of struggle that aims not only to rebuild the territorial rights
socializing social and natural resources, but also decentralizing management and
production of this wealth, from and for the people, allowing the distribution of
these resources deliver frameworks for effective popular control of urban territories and
rural.
We are confident that all revolutionary transformation requires awareness Engine
and social mobilization in order to move towards full political exercise.
Urban proposals against the forces of or related to the Chilean neoliberalism, our
position is converted back to the housing and city rights. We therefore propose:
- No more social integration policies, Chile lacks redistribute and socialize
urban wealth.
- No more over-production property, Chile lacks social production of habitat
in a broad sense and at all scales
- No more speculation or private land rent, Chile lacks regain ground
and its social function.

57

- No more regulatory policies, Chile makes you lack controlled land use planning
popular resources.
- No more center or outskirts, Chile lacks that each neighborhood has conditions
materials be city.
- No more crowding Latin American brethren, Chile lacks housing
dignity for immigrants and temporary residents.
- No more sustainability and green capitalism, Chile lacks sustainability
productive, popular management and social criteria
- No more transportation that encourages long distances, Chile lacks connectivity
Incentive strategic to local development
From March 2014, we will implement a new housing policy and development
city ​​supported by:
a) Influence of the neighborhoods and communities in the design and implementation of plans
territorial organization administered locally (districts and towns) resources. Any plan
democracy should include organized people, at least:
- Housing management,
- Management and leisure equipment,
- Management of production facilities,
- Management of popular heritage
- Management of public land and
- Environmental management.
b) Purchase of a stock of land to be allocated to social housing, thereby controlling
speculation in land prices by the real estate, whose main asset is the
land market.
c) Development of a policy on land value capture, where the construction of
involving not only housing gain for real estate, but also for the city and
their quality. The policy will be based on the right to payment of Construction:

58

real estate and construction should pay for the right to build a certain amount of
square meters, and with that money to invest in public works for its inhabitants.
d) Production of social housing from different sectors of the private economy. While
private historically they have played a role in generating social housing given its
playability, our government will advance in three lines:
- Strengthen the role of builders and small contractors by about real estate
and thus prevent much of the funding is intended to land prices;
- Encourage people through housing cooperatives, to build their
housing being supported through training and technical support for
SERVIU professionals;
- Take over the new housing allowance as there is a worry
sufficient stock of housing for lease, with regulation
speculation leases.
e) Bank (or Public Portfolio) land and buildings currently idle
f) Socialization of the construction industry, or definition of monitoring instruments
public about the type, quality and price of the offer. Application capture instruments
Urban income for producers
g) Diversification of land ownership schemes and housing
h) Adjustments land, to develop joint projects with rational land use by merging
those grounds are available to replace the small property structure
sets by private groups to centralize equipment and green area at the expense of
patios and individualized wineries
i) Pass of the fiscal policy of territorial tax instrument design capture income
Urban, in order to raise private producer punishing the housing and not those who use
property for own use.
j) Strategies for productive territorial development and socialist cooperative logic
k) Establishment of planning instruments and no control of the territory
l) Institutionalization of Barrios or localities as local territorial administration entities

4. The right to education
The main criticisms of capitalism to the chilean way have been staged and led by
the student movement since 2006 tries to make visible the crisis of the system
education. And this is not casual. Education plays a central role in its design and under
it is where the social model is promising.
Understood as a mechanism of formation of advanced human capital, education
would boost the economy by allowing, outward adaptation to the complex dynamics
globalizing and inward, promoting inclusion, social mobility and development.
Therefore it is also a pillar of legitimacy of the Chilean neoliberal capitalism.
However, the strategic plan for implementation of these principles has failed. He
strengthening of private education and its model -the State subsidiario- away to allow
social mobility, rather it has tended to reproduce the class structure in society and,
Therefore, to keep the problems of inequality and distribution of wealth. Instead of a
equal access to education, in terms of quality and job placement successful future, what
that has been generated is quite disparate educational structure: those with
better income, access to quality education and a successful market entry
job. Conversely, the lower income groups, the majority of the population, only
You can opt for a poor quality education and with no chance of mobility. He
Chilean educational system, instead of transforming the class structure society,
he does is play it.
For just offer some diagnostic elements:
•

Quality. A variety of research, beyond their differences, agree
that the great mass of the population does not have a skill development,
acquiring skills and sufficient knowledge to integrate desempeñarsee
effectively in society. A study in 2013 revealed that 65%
of higher education graduates people only understand simple texts, and total
of adults in the country, 80% are located in the most basic levels of understanding in April.

•

Equity. The results of standardized tests such as SIMCE show
significant gaps between rich and poor, depending on the levels of learning
acquired. PSU in 2012, for example, students with a family gross income

less than $ 288,000 pesos averaged 470 points on the math test, while

Social mobility. Despite this educational intergenerational mobility, that is,

intergenerational income has remained stable.

4.1 Explanatory factors

4.1.1 Legal frameworks. Constitution of the Republic and organic laws
The genesis of the current Chilean education system dates from the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.
While education is recorded as a constitutional right, have not generated the
laws and regulations necessary for the operationalization of this right. The
legal instruments responsible for this work are constitutional organic laws. In
1990 "Constitutional Organic Law of Education" 18,962-Law, enacted establishing the
last day of the military dictatorship - which will be replaced, product demonstrations
Student 2006 "General Law of Education" 2009-year-Law 20,370 of performing
transformations at the level of primary and secondary education, excluding modification level
higher education. LGE retains the main principles of the educational model
implanted in the dictatorship, for a number of structural elements that prevent the persist
realization of education as a right and explain, to an important extent,
problems of the national education system.
Among them it stands out, first, the absence of guarantees for compliance
right to education, unlike what happens with the right to property, the
academic freedom and free enterprise. Second, the role of the state is not transformed
enshrined in the constitution of 1980 which remains the alternative. And third
Instead, remains the model of financing education (school grant), which
money given directly to school holders 6. The figure of "private holder" has

generated a number of very harmful to the education elements. On the one hand, this in
practice has agreed to a profit from a model of education as a business.
In addition, he has the power to choose who educates, infringing the right to not
discrimination, which favors social segregation.

4.1.2 Model of administration, management and financing of education
- Grade Level: municipalization of subsidized education and public education.
At this level should operate a decentralized model of education, which ranks as
key figure in the municipal and private supporters. However, the reality is that,
far from decentralizing rather meant the transfer of management functions to
delivering municipalities without sufficient resources, and a growing privatization of
schools. These subsidized schools do not have tools to
ensure quality education and at the same time exclude the participation of the
in the same community. The MOE did not generate an effective mechanism to support and
monitor educational quality.
The state subsidizes private schools with the same amount of resources provided to the
municipal. It incorporates unfair competition between establishments, as most
subsidized monthly charge their students and also tend to generate
selection mechanisms, while municipal no barriers to entry,
issue that involves taking a much greater challenge.
- Level: the market as a major player
As happened at the school level, from the 1980s it was reduced substantially
pubic financing higher education. The constitution of 1980 and the General Act
Education allow the creation and establishment of private institutions without financing
the State, in addition to recognizing the emergence of two new figures: institutes
professional and technical training centers. The main actor responsible for this
Enlargement was the private sector, leaving the State relegated to a subsidiary role through
minimum contributions to state universities, in addition to providing scholarships - which cover
a marginal percentage of the total demand for education - and support credit systems
operated and managed by the Bank. That is, the funding falls mainly on
students and their families.

62

There has been an exponential growth of institutions of higher education from 1980 to
date 7 with total absence of regulation in regard to the amount of tariffs, tights
curriculum and quality of them. The institutions created for this purpose, such as
current "National Accreditation Commission" (CNA) have shown absolutely
incompetent to monitor and provide guidance to the higher education system. And in the last
Time has been involved in allegations of corruption, which has questioned all
the accreditation system.
4.1.3 teachers' working conditions
Teachers in Chile receive salaries that are far below the
average salary of other professionals in the country. Employability logic prevail without
contract, a situation that leaves teachers in high vulnerability. They may be
dismissed at any time at private institutions, which argues "reasons
company".
For those working in the municipalizada school education, should have the
dynamics shift political administrations, which often lack
knowledge about education and retaliate against those of a political nature
organized, or against those who have supported the students teachers. Furthermore,
salaries are considered by hours of actual class, excluding times
planning and correction regarding educational communities, attention to students. Are you
increase activities outside work hours and demanding times.
The extended mode of recruitment fees in private educational institutions
top, called the "Professor Taxi" creates conditions that affect not only the
teachers but also students and quality of education. There are no major
opportunities for coordination with other teachers and, therefore, hinders the effective management
and participation in educational communities.

4.1.4 purely market-oriented Education
As the SIMCE tests, aimed at measuring the quality of education, only measure
dimensions associated with knowledge in terms of curriculum content for work,
reducing the idea of ​​what we mean by education, since the elements are excluded
emotional, social, cultural and civic education.

With respect to the PSU, it is proven that it is an instrument of reproduction

4.1.5 Education without social participation
There is a total lack of consideration of the participation of society in both the
Discussion on the model of education, as well as with respect to the management.
There is a logic of patronage rather, through which students and their families are
consideradores system users and customers, relegating their role as citizens, as
active participants in the design and development of education.

4.2 Proposal
We propose radically transform the Chilean educational system based on:

4.2.1 Guiding Principles
•

Education as a social right. Public, free education and excellence
all

Education should be regarded as a social right, constitutionally established and
legamente secured through general laws and decrees. It will be understood
as a pubic right which, as such, must be guaranteed by the State,
Free access and excellence for all alike. This implies a strengthening
public education, and places the state as the main actor responsible for delivering education
its citizens.
•

End profit

To the extent that it is a social right, education will no longer be understood as a business.
Therefore, as a law you can not generate profit with it. This does not imply

ban on private education but that will be established as illegal generation
profit from it.
•

Education with socialist orientation, liberating and revolutionary

The purpose of education, not only includes strategic objectives such as ensuring
proper integration into the labor market but is aimed at liberation of peoples, the
generation of people with critical judgment towards the transformation of society. Is
necessary to break with the individualistic, competitive and authoritarian logic imposed by the
dictatorship. This measure must tend to the horizontal above the current relationship
authoritarian between teacher and student, besides promoting non-discrimination and multiculturalism.
•

The solution is not everything the State: the importance of self-management

The only alternative to privatization of education is not statism. In this manner,
a seal of our project, we focus on the incorporation of self-management. Is
necessary to advance against the individualistic orientations towards a society based on
community association and its members. Self-management, in this context, is understood by
we as a way of life with socialist projections, to the extent that creates jobs
Real with the popular movement. Progress is needed on the popular progressive administration

As, we have the possibilities to collectively design and carry out life

They make up a society of good living.

4.2.2 Policies and transformations
Guidance and teaching model.
•

Liberating education with social orientation, against individualism and competition.

•

Revolutionary education, which trains men and women as historical actors,
capable and responsible for transforming and operating conditions
existing oppression.

65

•

Abandonment of the notion of education as a market for its conception
expanded space for training as a human being in emotional terms, ideological
and moral.

Legal normative level
•

Through social constituent assembly and establish education as a right
provided social and guaranteed by the state.

•

Generation of regulations and laws that allow give effect to that right.

•

Equal education, excellence for all.

•

Effective prohibition of profit in education. Education as a right and not as
tradable good market.

5. The right to health
As it is structured health system in Chile today nobody can
sick, because health is not a right. Unlike. For the whole economy developed in
about health (insurance, clinics, laboratories), the disease is a business. Capitalism
neoliberal rubs his hands every time someone falls ill, while this or that someone
probably you have to mortgage their lives to receive treatment or care without waiting in the
public system or to pay for treatment or care at prohibitive prices in the system
private.
In the public system, today serves CEFAM patients twice its capacity will
It allowed. And doctors make diagnoses deficient for lack of time and resources. If
off, officials and civil servants working in poor (low labor conditions

67

wages and grueling schedules), which affects the service and attention they give you the
users and to users.
Gradually, transfers of public resources to private providers, the health system
public begins to be a sly, slow privatization process. This loss of
precarious resources benefits the public system, which is where we serve the
low-income people.
Root propose to change this system that has a rich health and health
poor. For that,
a) will eliminate the profit and ISAPRES system and create a unified system
greeting, which is universal and free.
b) the system will incorporate intercultural health
c) The health planning will be done with community participation and under supervision
people power
d) Increase health spending 6% of GDP to remove household spending
e) professional coverage will expand to 2.1 doctors per 1000 inhabitants
f) Create a national network of clinics and family physicians
g) Increase the supply of hospital beds per 1000 population 4.2
h) Create a system of fair wages for health officials
i) I Create "Farmapaís" a public entity drug distribution.

6. The right to communication and plural information
The current Chilean media system has two important features
political consequences. On the one hand, it has high levels of concentration. Only two groups
economic (El Mercurio of the Edwards group and Copesa Saieh group) control more
98% of the market for printed newspapers and a single consortium (Iberoamericana
PRISA Radio Chile) owns the sufficient number of broadcasters

68

to reach 50% of the national radio audience alone and concentrate
similar serving of cake avisaje in that format.
There is also significant overlap of political and economic interests between the
groups and consortia that control mass communication markets. Everybody has
rooted in or linked to the (national and global) financial capital and groups
religious of the local elite. Therefore, voices and speeches are contrary to those interests
banned or severely subrepresentaados on the agenda and grills your means,
they are almost all. In practice an impenetrable barrier against today operates in Chile
speeches or dissenting thoughts. And that not only seriously undermines the
plurality, the right to reply and freedom of expression. In addition, it is a weapon
(Communication) against the trends of reorganization of society and against
growth of dissent and counter-actions as compared to the
mass audience, the invisible and / or stereotypes: social conflicts are
systematically silenced and criminalized social movements and citizens.
Colloquially, counter-hegemonic actors have dubbed this barrier with the
name "information and communication fence" and have been identified as one of the
Chile's most important guarantors of single thought, that neoliberal thinking
economic, conservative-Christian, patriarchal and homophobic in valórico, and huincacéntrico
pioneer in ethno-cultural, and binomial, technocrat and pro-constitution Pinochet in
political.
This particular form of mass communication structure in Chile seriously undermines
the fundamental right to inform and be informed / a. Majority voices of society are
invisible minority voices and monopolize the circulation of messages, codes and symbols.
There is nothing like plurality on the agenda.
To reverse this situation and create conditions suitable for guaranteeing the right
essential to communication and to be informed, we propose democratizing the system
media. For that,
a) We will encourage the development of community media, radio and TV
TV, with funding of the necessary infrastructure to assemble and make
function.
b) the budget for state advertising is distributed to all media
alternative media equally. Media self-sustaining by
way of advertising sales and higher annual profits to $ 10,000,000 pesos not
They receive public funds.

69

c) Implement 33-33-33 policy that has proven successful in Ecuador: 33%
digital radio spectrum will be allocated to private channels, 33% to the State and channels
33% to community media and social organizations.
d) All of these transformations are performed through a Communications Act and the
right to information.
e) The law strictly prohibited the existence of "preferential rights" in the field of
communications using the radio spectrum.
f) We will recover the property on the production of pulp and paper to ensure equal
access to the printing of all print media.

7. The right to self-cultivation
Remove all legal obstacles that hinder the exercise of the right to
self-cultivation and the recreational use of substances.

70

IV. The good life
The overthrow of capitalism, the construction of a republic in which the people send and
recovery of our rights will be complete transformations only if we
reshaping the way we relate to each / as, among us / as and our
urban space and between us / as and nature. The paradigm of relationships that we have
Capitalism tax chilean way, the market or neoliberal paradigm, is becoming
unsustainable. The relationships we have among us in our quality
you people are damaged by the mediation of the market; we see and treat each
Again as competitors and / or goods. Relations between the State of Chile and
its native peoples have created a deep human rights crisis in Wallmapu.
The relations of the neoliberal economy with our environment bring us ever
more ecological catastrophe. The relationship of our society with urban space is
increasingly stormy and chaotic.
By its results and principles, it is crucial to change the paradigm that governs
our social relations and organized our society. Replace the exhausted
market paradigm for a renewed and innovative form of relations between beings
human, between community and urban space, and between society and nature. The paradigm
organization of society is that we will build our villages wise originating
qamaña have called sum, sumak kawsay or Küme felen, terms that have been translated
as "good living" or "live well".
The "good life" is a paradigm of organization of social, economic, cultural and political life
which is based on solidarity, the community and the collective, and unity between human,
biological, psychological, social and natural. It aims to develop a life of respect,
harmony and balance with all that exists. Therefore, it is an organizational model
radically opposed to capitalism. In individualism, opposed by the collective life and
Community; their marginalization and exclusion of peoples and social sectors unprofitable, will
opposes integration and equality; its exploitation of labor, opposed by respect for
human dignity; his predatory nature, opposed by the harmony with it. The center of
a society of good living is the integral human being embedded in social relations and
ecological, and not profit or gain.
The fourth major objective of the government of the popular movement led by Roxana Miranda
It is precisely the development of a society organized according to the principles
the good life, based on integration and solidarity, personal development
comprehensive and harmony with nature.

71

1. Integration, solidarity and equality
In a society living the good life on equal terms while maintaining its
identity and autonomy all constituent groups. The composition of a society
complex in its diversity allows us to seize the territory and build on collective and
consciously a rich and plural coexistence. The cultural diversity is a strength.
This is our proposal to make it possible.

1.1 Towards a society and a plurinational State
Historically the state's relationship with indigenous peoples in Chile has been marked
two strategies: the use of the forces of order and security and legislative apparatus.
Through them was gradually decreasing its territory and assimilating the
Chilean society. At the same time, since the beginning of the Chilean state was implemented
and imposing on society a process of national homogenization that has steadily
failed and refused to mix that was at the base of the formation of our
society. On the contrary, a submission of the indigenous and their culture was exercised. Thus, the composition
national theoretically is the absence of the indigenous.
Since the imposition of neoliberalism in Chile, our peoples have been
object also a model that strongly affect their livelihoods. Modernization
compulsive Chilean State has taken a series of model projects themselves
primary exporter to interlock in indigenous settlements, which led to serious
consequences to environmental, economic, social and cultural level. This also involved the
private income as key players in territorial disputes that have
appeared in recent decades.
In this context, and in recent years with unusual force, the actions of the State
deeply affected the individual and collective human rights of indigenous peoples. The
Carabineros procedures have incurred a series of excesses that have
including physical and psychological mistreatment of members of communities in conflict,
destruction of their property and, in severe cases they have ended with the death of young
Mapuche. Also the use of emergency laws (like the Patriot Act) against
commoners, has involved a series of irregularities in legal proceedings;
among them, the violation of the guarantees of due process, which is supported by the
international human rights system, with another set of principles relating to it
same. The Terrorism Act also has been applied, in most cases, crimes
property and not against the people.
In terms of collective rights, our peoples are still considered
"Ethnicity" in the Constitution; They are not considered people, with its own institutions, ways
organization and territories but simple groups united by one language and biological traits.

72

This issue is not only a nominal problem, but directly affects the rights
that Indians may sue. In addition, government policies have failed to solve
the demands on land rights and territory, even the less demanding autonomy.
Each native people inhabiting the territory of Chile has particular demands. But
demands that require general policies and changes in the state and society.
Our government will focus on six of them
a) Constitutional recognition. We propose to recognize constitutionally
indigenous peoples in their character and not of ethnic groups. That means to testify to Chile
as a multinational state.
b) Self-determination and territorial autonomy. Establish self-determination
original towns. Self-determination of peoples implies an appropriation of their
territory, a chance to decide on the resources found therein, and
ability to determine their own future as a people. Self-determination means
Also, as set out in Convention 169 of the ILO, that the people should have
ability to decide on the model of economic, social and cultural development that will
object. And finally, it involves the creation of political and social institutions in their territories
according to their own customs.
c) New indigenous law. We propose to create a new indigenous law that, unlike
the law currently in force, is the product of the joint deliberation of organizations
of different native peoples. It commit new Indigenous Law proposed by them and
applying its powers will not be merely advisory. Organizations, associations
and indigenous communities will have broad powers beyond the advisory. This law will
precedence over other laws.
d) New institutions. We finish with CONADI to create a Ministry of
Indigenous peoples, where they are the protagonists. Their authorities shall be elected
democratically through organizations of indigenous peoples. The expressions
This new regional Ministry should have bilingual staff, according to the language
originally predominant in each region.
e) Intercultural. All our policies on health and education will be bilingual and
intercultural. They plasmarán respect the knowledge and culture of our peoples.
Also, we begin to open up spaces for applying indigenous justice in coordination
with different people and their communities.
e) Return of lands. Our government will begin work with communities
villages to carry out a survey of the lands claimed by the Indians as
ancestral. From this, and through a special fund created for this purpose,
We begin the transfer of the territories usurped.

73

f) An end to the militarization and the application of emergency laws against protest
Indian. In our government it will not be applied any Act protest against Exception
indigenous, while this is part of a legitimate right. It will also grant amnesty to all
political prisoners and all Mapuche political prisoners. Desmilitarizaremos also the
Arauco territory, ending with all sorts of abuses that our people suffer today
originating in their territory.

1.2 Towards an egalitarian society in terms of gender
The State of Chile has acquired international political and legal commitments that bind
implement policies to ensure gender equality. The Convention on the Elimination
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW (1979), which Chile ratified in
1989, provides that States parties should adopt legislative measures to
enshrine gender equality.
However, as in the past 23 years the policies that could involve advances in
gender have been designed, designed and implemented keeping intact the model
neoliberal, in practice, have deepened inequalities and inequities, and within these,
mainly those of gender.
The gender driven from the ruling political establishment and, as has been
proposed a transformation of the capitalist system, it has focused its actions
primarily on issues related to the free choice of sexuality, where the
Respect course involves hiding the problem and stop criticizing; playback,
where medical factors commodify pregnancy and childbirth are imposed; violence
gender, where only reference to violence against women as isolated events done;
femicide and sexual abuse; and finally, with the concern to ensure the availability
permanent market for women workers in precarious conditions
employment and sexual exploitation icon.
Without denying legitimacy to the claims relating to sexual and reproductive rights
women, the elimination of all forms of discrimination and violence against
woman, we believe that, in this inequality, both gender and class, has
its foundations in the implementation of the neoliberal capitalist model that disregards and violates the
rights not only (though particularly) women, but all beings
human and human beings, as they are understood as commodities and resources
available.
In the post dictatorial and keeping intact context of neoliberal policies, it has created
institutional gadgetry to address the problems of women: the National Service
(SERNAM). The SERNAM has developed programs (Equal Plans

74

PIO opportunities, programs to improve the management, GMPs) whose logic
targeting key segments in certain women who are defined as
vulnerable. The process obviously targeting the condition of people violated in their
Rights for the neoliberal state (Female Heads of Household program, the Program itself
Rural women, many related to violence, etc.) programs. Therefore, no
We found a significant improvement in the position and status of most
Women living in Chile. Therefore, the state is in debt in the
fulfilling commitments made on gender equality and non-discrimination.
Without claiming to exhaust the diagnosis, which must be made territorial and
participatory, some elements to consider and express these deep flaws
They are:
-

The participation rate of women in the labor market, considering
flexible labor policies, lack of protection of workers, the
Outsourcing remains below most countries
Latin Americans.

-

The majority of women who work do so in terms of subcontracting
and various works in precarious conditions and abuse.
20 years
implementation of neoliberal policies, the wage gap between men and women
Chile has fallen only from 70% in 1990 to 80.1% in 2011.

- A working hours in sweatshop conditions, job insecurity and inequality
about Work / salary earned by men, should be considered roles
Historic awarded to women, such as the maintenance of the home,
education / parenting / as and care of elderly and sick which extends
the workday to 24 hours continuous day.
-

With the current system of AFPs it is estimated that men receive a retirement
41% of his salary, but women, by having a longer life expectancy, receive
on average only 22%. That is, a woman who has devoted 30 years of his life
work, upon retirement, will reduce its revenue by 88%.

- Despite the existence of the Optional Protocol to CEDAW, which Chile has not
and ratified all international complaints in this matter, in our country
abortion is prohibited and penalized under any circumstances. His penalty
power and deepens the inequalities generated by the Chilean neoliberalism, because in
reality 234 abortions a day are performed, an estimated 100,000 a year, and are the
entries which define the type of abortion that can be accessed. That is, the
Women fewer resources are more vulnerable to injury or death.

75

-

We do not have policies that promote and ensure access both from the
formal educational institutions (schools, colleges and high schools) and from the
individual interest, education and information about issues of sexuality and
gender. This not only has to do with the reproductive and prevention
diseases, but should involve the training of individuals aware of their
sexuality from the beginning stage to the decision to want to be or not to be parents and
mothers, through prevention of diseases and conditions possibly
traumatic, as the performance or nonperformance of an abortion, homosexuality,
considered sexual object abused by a system that transforms the body into a
product market, etc.

- There is no guarantee of a free and universal access strategies and technologies
preventing pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections, which allow us to live
a dignified and free sexuality and reproductive imperative heterosexuality in
respecting our right to decide.
-

We have no parliamentary representation of women parity, and in all the
spheres of society, opera effect "glass ceiling" which indicates that, insofar
that advances in hierarchical positions of power, participation of women
reduced. This happens both in politics and in the spaces of power
economic and academic knowledge.

-

The destruction of the environment and the privatization of natural resources affects
everybody. But it has particular impact on the lives of women.
The problems of quality and access to water for household consumption, for example, impact
directly in the work and domestic responsibilities, usually by
a woman. If the disease increase as a result of pollution
producing companies (Freirina, Puchuncavi, Calama, Arica, among others), who
preferably they stop going to work, spend hours queuing up at clinics,
increase their unpaid work time and decrease your rest, are the
women.

-

In a country where commercial advantage on male and female figure is
legitimized and institutionalized exploitation and inequality, violence against
indifference to women and gender issues have various forms of
expression in domestic spaces against subjects are displayed as
vulnerable (children, women and old / os) in the media with
the use of sexist, aggressive language and mockery gender differences
always of inferiority to the female figure, homosexual and / or transsexual to figure
male, denostándola to this also with the adjective dominant, gross and
degenerate. This is fostered in the collective unconscious disqualification, the
mockery and violence towards icons that imposes the same system and thus us

76

confront among ourselves. A system that does not consider us all equal and
instead it qualifies us right or wrong according to our gender and sexual orientation.
-

Our educational system reproduces gender inequalities, it is not incorporated
in the curriculum development of teaching strategies, content and approach
allow us to educate in assessing the scientific, human, technological
men and women and the devaluation of perpetuating social, the domestic and the
Community.

-

The history of Chile, besides being told from the perspective of the powerful,
It offers women a secondary place, which does not recognize its importance
sociopolitical and invisible social and political struggles that allowed them to get
citizens' rights. More serious is the absence in the historical account of the
village women, peasant, indigenous who are portrayed and recounted
not only from the lack, vulnerability and, at most, the folkloric.

1.2.1 Structural measures
Although our diagnosis rescues just some areas that account for multiple
gender inequalities present in our country and the silence and denial of the right to
free and full, sexuality also realize the breadth and depth of
transformations required to achieve the company's "Good Life" from Equality.
For this reason, always considering the profound changes that allow us to advance
to the good life, they will be generated and discussed joint territorial spaces
people power, we will implement structural and economic measures to build together
all reality and all free of discrimination, indifference and capitalist exploitation
our bodies, our sexuality and our capabilities as men and women.
Our structural measures are:
a) Creation of the Ministry of Gender Equality, allowing interim compliance
the cultural rights of all people in gender social, political, and.
i.

The ministry will consist of a board and territorial elective representation.

ii.

Multiple territorial boards, assemblies and political discussion spaces will be formed
and proposal which will have its representative in the Ministry and the carrying
problematic features of each territory and its reality.

77

iii.

It will ensure that all new policies implemented by the State, promote and
possible to achieve and strengthen gender equality.

iv.

He at protection of discrimination, exclusion or invisibility of not deepen
women and gender and sexual diversity in any social or political sphere.

v.

It will promote the claim and pride of gender diversity. Not only respect,
tolerance and integration.

saw.

Small regional organizations having their representative in the
Ministry should be compulsorily made up of two representatives ínimo m
different gender (being the ideal that all genres were represented
even without age distinction, ie boys / girls and old / os) this how one factor
legitimacy for political and social discussion about gender and sexuality.

b) Incorporate the imperative of gender equality in measures to transform
the capitalist system, expressed among others in the transformation of the pension system in the
relationship and resolving environmental conflicts in education, in labor and health,
among others.
c) Remove any penalty against the right of women to decide about their body and
sexuality.
d) Establish the right to nursery of all workers, regardless of the number of
women in the company.
e) post-natal regulation that covers all the needs of the mother and / the child / a, having
paid compensation equivalent to the subsidy maternal mother perceived three months
before the child's conception, integrity 6 months after childbirth or
daughter. Furthermore, this may continue to breastfeed your baby until life, favoring
Thus, a secure attachment style of the mother with her child.
d) Create incentives for the distribution of reproductive work:
i.

Post-natal inalienable 5 days for the father, taken continuously from
the birth of their daughter or son, without possibility of splitting

ii.

Beginning with the child 8 months old, the parent may access a permit
to feed your son or daughter is at nursery, equivalent to the
mother. This time off may be used by the father in the midst of their journey
work, discounting their time snack, or to withdraw an hour before

78

the end of their workday, as the mother can do in the situation
equivalent. This right may be exercised until the year of baby's life.

1.2.2 The short-term measures
In the short term and to address current challenges, we will implement the following
measures:
a) Ratification of the Optional Protocol to the CEDAW, and immediate legislation
decriminalize therapeutic abortion.
b) Beginning of territorial discussion of the way forward towards ensuring the rights
reproductive women, which considers a discussion on legalizing abortion
Free and universal.
c) Implementation of Sexual Education policies, and universal and free access to the
preventive technologies pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. With
respect for confidentiality and the right to decide for everyone.
d) Design and implementation of a comprehensive participatory public policy that encourages
female employability in terms of formality and to ensure, through
control and incentive system, the principle "Equal Work Equal Pay".
e) Review and expand, as a responsibility of the state, the legislation relating to post natal
six months to ensure that both men and women, can abocarse to
care of children and young daughters and exercise their right to decent work, if they wish.
f) To incorporate in the plans and programs of schools and colleges, work appreciation
home as a work of all / as; respect for sexual diversity and
gender.
g) Start an educational curriculum reform allowing tell the story of Chile
popular perspective, gender and sexual diversity.

1.3 The sexual diversity and gender identity
Chile is one of the most backward societies of the world in terms of rights
valoric involve disputes. It was one of the last to approve the divorce and,

79

Today is one of five that does not decriminalize therapeutic abortion. And compared to other
companies which have been addressed and given satisfactory response to the demands of the various
movements of sexual diversity and gender identity, the Chilean situation is somewhat
More serious. The political duopoly, plus hoarder and co-opted by the economic groups,
It is retrograde and timid. All governments have closed their ranks around the valórico immobility and
this entails serious violations for women and the gay community.
Our government will end this stagnation. As previously announced, will eliminate all
penalties against the freedom of choice of women about their bodies and
sexuality. But also we will ensure equal access rights to the community
and homosexual couples of the same sex. For that,
a) we send a bill to legalize gay marriage, to establish,
Furthermore, full equality between heterosexual and homosexual couples to create family
and adopt children.
b) defend that position and that proposal at all levels of decision by the
Social Constituent Assembly to be equal marriage and adoption
Same-sex couples have a constitutional level.
c) We will send to Congress a bill to guarantee gender identity and the right
dignity of transgender people, who are generally violated their rights
economic, social and cultural rights. The law not only allow the exercise of autonomy Ia
definition of the genre itself before public and private institutions. He also regulate
right to identity of transgender children.

1.4 The Third Age 9
Adults and older adults in Chile are in a grave situation
vulnerability and violation. Hunger pensions system and pays their AFPs
leaves them economic autonomy and, in most of the cases, and the sentence be
below the poverty line. The assistance patches of non-pension reform 2008
far from resolving the situation, generate additional: stigmatization.
We as a social and political movement expressed in the Equality Party, which can not be
leave it to political will, or transient government programs, projects

The following proposal was watered ent Roxana Miranda by various groups and associations
the third Age. His candidacy vowed to make it their own and defend it where necessary.

80

contestable or decrees, safety and the lives of older people; that's
leave in neglect, marginalization and uncertainty.
So we create policies with the participation of the people and seniors
consider all aspects and needs of life of older people,
all their fundamental human rights: free and comprehensive health, work suited to their
needs, decent housing, access to culture and recreation, right to continuity
education and training, free transportation.
Many have priority measures will be implemented by our government:
a) Ensure access to comprehensive health care without waiting or delays in care services
public and private if necessary, with free medicines.
b) The establishment of decent pensions, standardizing benefits to all
Chile pensioners
c) Ensuring housing without debt, canceling debts and payment of contributions.
d) Free shuttle
The following measures should be developed in the medium and long term:
a) decent housing. We will ensure through special plans and housing subsidies and
We will order payment of contributions for the elderly; condone debts
contracted with private banks in social housing, we build homes without
indebtedness and quality with adequate footage and conditions for the disabled.
b) Decent Work: we will guarantee the right to work in appropriate conditions to
needs of the elderly and disabled; facilitate the creation of
employment for seniors.
c) Education and self-education: We will provide free admission to various levels
education for older people. For leveling, training and education
personal.

81

1.5 Towards a melting pot of American society: friends / as of peoples, not
10 migrants
Gradually, Chile is becoming a host country for migrants. But although
Spain ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All
Migrant Workers and Their Families and recognizes the Universal Declaration of the Rights
Humans, in our country there is no effective recognition of the rights and
immigrants.
An important part of this situation is based on the fundamental migration rules
Chile is Decree Law on Foreigners, 1975. Thanks to her, the situation for a person
migrant in Chile today is vulnerable and restriction of rights rather than full
reception and integration.
-a Current rules mainly due to the types of visa difficult establece-
that the migrant exercise rights as a citizen. This restricts the inclusion and
and detonates integration problems such as irregular migration and the emergence of groups
violated and outside the legal institutions, political, labor and programs
It offered by the social State.
In addition, the large space gives the officer discretion leads to practices
arbitrary and discriminatory in the granting of visas and residence permits. In spite of
be instructive of the different ministries and public agencies aimed at regulating the
and the situation of migrants, the problems they face are very complex. In
education, migrant children encounter obstacles to validate their studies in the
country, which is exacerbated by ignorance with public officials
on policy. The same applies to higher professional and technical education or
lack of expeditious mechanisms of recognition of qualifications. Nor it is incorporating a
intercultural approach in the curriculum and programs of primary and secondary education.
In the workplace, the greater abuses and bad practices are related
existence of the "Visa Subject to Contract", forcing the migrants depend for
two years of the same contractor at risk of losing their visa if they change jobs or lose
our pension funds if he returned to our country and not be professional or
technicians, regardless of the agreements signed by governments.

10

The following proposal was watered ent Roxana Miranda by the Sectoral Technical Secretariat and as Month
Theme
the Civil S ociety and various associations of migrants. Your andidatura c promised to make
yours and defend where necessary.

82

The persistence of this legislation creates a migrants in irregular situations,
in the field of labor and social security translates into cheap labor and
unprotected rights, which is not what the Labour Code provides fulfilled.
That is, wages below the legal minimum, irregular payment of contributions
pension, excessive and harmful conditions at work days. All I know
exacerbated by the legal defense, as the migrant fears come to Inspection and
labor authorities, for fear of being detained and deported.
In social security, the agreements do not allow internationally established
resolve the transfer and accumulation of funds in one country to workers who are not
professionals or technicians.
In the field of health there is a lack of policy and explicit instructions
that have been enacted to regulate the care of migrants, so that the service
officials is delivered to the will and personal judgment. The most affected and more
affected by this situation are migrant children.
The lack of decent housing is one of the most serious realities experienced by the migrant. He
It is in situation of irregular migration results in hundreds of
families live in overcrowded and, in the absence of contracts leases, left without a legal means
to protect them.
The current legislation does not expressly or guarantee the principle of reunification
family established in Article 44 of the International Convention on the Protection of
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Their Families. Since 2010 they have been
tightened criteria for immigration violations or punish offenses and deny entry
foreign to Chile. In these decisions the principle of reunification is not taken into account
family
In the case of migrant children born in Chile whose parents are in
irregular situation, it is understood that they are children of transient foreigners, interpretation
tramples the International Convention on the Rights of the Child, as it leads to the existence
stateless children, violent condition that their right to a nationality, denying
plus access to public policies of protection of the state to them. Urge
Chile then sign and ratify the Convention on the Status of Stateless Persons.
To combat the precarious situation and violation of the rights of the migrants
in Chile, our government will implement the following policies:
a) design a migration policy focusing on Human Rights, focusing on the
integration and promotion of a culture of acceptance and integration, to incorporate the contribution of
migration in the country's development in all areas. To implement this policy

83

we will draw the responsibility of the immigration policy of the Ministry of Interior and the
assign a specialized institutions: the National Secretariat for Migration.
b) we send a bill to Congress to recognize the political rights and
migrants, who may exercise through political and electoral participation, and choosing
applying to be elected and chosen. We will defend this position and proposal in the Assembly
Social Constituent for constitutional scope.
c) Reform the curriculum of primary and secondary education and to integrate the recognition and
consideration of the contributions of migrants to national development in all
areas and educate the rejection of discrimination, xenophobia and racism.
d) We will encourage the association of migrants and their participation in the various bodies
State linked to social and cultural development.
e) insist on the ratification by the Chilean Congress residence Agreement
Mercosur and associated countries. We will promote and extend it to the citizens
movement throughout Latin America and the Caribbean.
h) will increase the resources of the Public Ministry and the Police Research
Combat Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants. Implement programs
prevention coordinated with the countries of the region from which the question.
i) We will stop the legislative process of immigration law sent by the current government and
send a new one, and eliminate utilitarian considerations of migration,
underpinned by a focus on human rights.
Our government will return the hand to countries that welcomed our brothers and
our sisters in the long night of genocide and state terrorism should receive
asylum for political reasons. Chile will become a hospitable society as it was
before 1973, he starting to treat those who come to our country as friends and friends
of other peoples.

2. Community, city, public space and culture
A society of living well maintained a harmonious relationship with their shared space. He
fit between their communities and the urban environment is essential for development
healthy staff. So it is a fundamental problem for a government of the popular movement
pursuing the good life.

2.1 Community safety and corporate crime
The violence is strongly linked to the present socio-economic system in Chile
today. Macroeconomic growth rates the country has not been accompanied
an improvement in the living standards of the entire population, ranking Chile
one of the most unequal countries worldwide. This polarization of incomes is
marked by a fragile middle class that sees threatened his accomplishments daily, and for
percentage of population living in harsh poverty that has not been possible to overcome from
sectoral and targeted policies undertaken by the State.
In this context, there are high levels of frustration and anomie in important sectors of our
country. The feeling comes from a system that offers what can not be consumed and
when the walls of exclusion and marginalization for a large portion of our people,
They appear as insurmountable. The insecurity that is now installed as a reality
for many and many, has as its backdrop the fact that direct consequences
the high rates of economic growth reach only a small portion of the
people of Chile. We then necessary-contrary to what has been observed in
recent years, begin to seek political solutions rather than police, focusing on
that everyone can satisfy their rights.
So far, the response in our neighborhoods and populations to problems
crime and drug addiction has been to lock ourselves in our homes. The more keys and
padlocks, the better. To us and we seem far more ineffectual us all. By
populations our experience we know that the higher levels of security
of our population necessarily involves a reconstruction of the social fabric in the country,
through the appropriation of territories by the community and its different
organizations. An important part of the solutions to the subjective feeling of insecurity
passes to know and trust our neighbors, to illuminate public spaces for
our children are occupying the squares and, above all, because the
people's organizations, in their different ways, are the guarantors of good living in Chile.
Regardless of its causes, in recent decades the growth evidenced
reported crimes, the use of violence as a means of conflict resolution
citizens and a sense of high insecurity in the population.
Still, Chile in comparative perspective appears with the highest levels of security
regional, they are presenting the lowest homicide rates and crime levels less
violent. In this sense, it is possible to argue that the problem is not rates
criminal violence, which are still relatively low, but in the subjective perception of violence
and insecurity on the part of the citizenry, which has resulted in a change of behavior of the
people. That has meant a reduction in the use of infrastructure and public space

85

taking greater safety guards at residences. While many factors
You influence this feeling of insecurity, it is recognized that this primarily relates
both treatment that has been given in the media, of character
highly sensational, as the political use that it has had.
State action in relation to security has focused on generating policing strategies
more policies. In this regard, efforts aimed at eradicating not generate the
causes of crime but rather to placate their expressions and symptoms. This can be
observe both in public policies related to the topic such as eg
increase in both budget and personnel to police institutions, most
investment in penal institutions and judicial system reforms, as in the
strategic planning of governments, where premium the operationalization of the
strategies before political proposals on these. This is also evidenced in the
treatment of the various social conflicts that occur in Chile, where,
in general, the repressive action is privileged before a consideration of these as
demonstrations of a political nature.
Inequality has its counterpart in the access security. The wealthier districts
They have greater allocation of police force that lower-income communities. When we
then refer to political solutions to the security, we talk about attack
Today many causes that promote insecurity in Chile.
Finally, the focus on insecurity has distracted attention from the focus of the crimes
They have greater practical effect on citizens and consumers and the offenses
corporate. As the agenda was taken over by the common crime, has not reached the
citizen service volume and severe effects of white-collar crime. Our
government reverse this situation and try to corporate crimes with the importance
They deserve.

2.1.1 Prevention, from the community, as the axis of our proposal ....
The high feeling of insecurity of the population has led to a reduction in the use of the
infrastructure and public space, which in turn inhibits the generation of spaces
find protected. Against this, the involvement of the community is
key to improving any security strategy, so it is necessary to promote
the use of public spaces and promote ownership by the community.
So far, the logic of political incorporation of citizens in security has been
tending to a "politicization" of the community. Here, rather than generating a tissue
social that can support its members in order to avoid criminal behavior, has
favored the emergence of a kind of generalized surveillance underpinned by saperío

86

between neighbors / as, hindering the development of social relationships and bonds of trust. Yes
While there has been an emphasis on prevention, has been given in the same terms: the fear of
legal consequences or social stigmatization.
Our commitment to safety given the opposite: a community that allows
development of all and all belonging to it from its various interests;
a community where identity and generate solidarity ties among neighbors and
neighboring allowing a better defense of their neighborhood. Community control is the basis
our security proposal.
In practical terms, we will encourage the creation of funds through the Ministry of the Interior and
Division of Social Organizations that promote the use of public space,
They will be easily accessible to all sectors and will favor their dissemination through
municipalities where the most vulnerable sectors of our society are concentrated.
Likewise, we will promote coordination with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development; by way of
that projects are implemented by attacking the totality of factors that influence today
urban segregation.

2.1.2 National Public Safety Policy
Prevention at the community level must be facilitated and promoted by a Policy
National Public Security, you define a consistent state policy. This policy
You must recognize the multicausal origin and complexity of the phenomenon of crime, and from
where the deployment of a set of actions to address fully all arises
size reduction of victimization and fear.
In this context, we are interested in enhancing social organizations interventions both
neighborhoods and the creation of a national security policy. Many communities,
NGOs and various stakeholders have worked long ago the issue of security.
With them and from them is that we will create a National Public Security Policy.
Through this policy, we propose to reduce the high level of autonomy they now possess
the police forces, the Interior Ministry taking a leading role against
territorial distribution of staffing, operational and logistical function of force, development
institutional doctrine, characteristics and content of education and training
personnel and human resources management.

87

2.1.3 prison system and rehabilitation
The emphasis on prevention, in no way implies a waiver of the punishment of crimes. Is
need to improve and establish equal access to security and justice, ensuring
guarantees all citizens, including persons who violate the law.
Opposite the prison system as a first step we propose to the granting of the
prisons in Chile and the progressive nationalization of the entire prison system.
Secondly, and in relation to the prison population, we promote workshops
training and recreation for this, from coordination with institutions and individuals
that they are trained for this.
Regarding reintegration, one of the biggest problems is that once outside the
prisons, people can not access are used because their
background stained, which often determines that these re-offending. In
Here, we will implement a policy of state employment to those who have served their
conviction.
To ensure the fundamental rights of persons deprived of liberated and
They decongest the prison system, they are left free to those without judgment
final and enforceable

2.1.4 Attacking the root corporate crime
With an agenda taken over by common criminals, volume and high impact
corporate crime has been virtually invisible. And as it is invisiblizada, the
system of criminal prosecution has no incentive to investigate and process. Our
government will change this situation: its impact on the population, will make the
corporate crime in the main security objective. To do this, we implement
Four policy:
a) dotaremos more resources to the units of the Public Ministry and the Police
Specialized research in investigating and prosecuting major
economic crimes.
b) We will encourage the leniency of corporate crime
c) We will create a special program to protect witnesses in cases of corporate crime.

88

d) will remove criminal privileges they now enjoy the authors and the authors of the
corporate crime.

2.1.5 Security and good living
The model that public policy so far has dealt with crime have failed.
The famous "end of the revolving door" is just one of the symptoms. Whatever you do
neoliberal governments, insecurity in Chile increases year to year.
The only thing that has made the repressive policies of neo-liberalism is destroying the social fabric and
cause an abandonment of public spaces, mainly in the districts and sectors
lower incomes. It has led, in short, "unsavory" social separation and confinement.
An important part of the good life lies in social integration and community life. Our
security proposal not only puts to good living as a target, but uses it as
half. That is the importance of security for our historic project. And so
we will make a priority of our government to end the failed policy of repression and
"Politicization" of our communities. Lost our cities it is critical to
achieve the good life.

2.2 Protection of sites of memory 11
Besides being a tangible heritage sites recovered memory, reflect and
spread past events and link them with the present, creating a body of
intangible heritage that contributes to the development of our society today.
The recovered in these spaces, memory is related to the crimes committed as
part of state terrorism; as well as with the experiences, values ​​and
commitments of the social movement and political parties and organizations were
persecuted by the dictatorship.
In that sense, this work the need for truth and justice against violations association
human rights, past and present in our country; condemning practices
repressive and undemocratic imposed and inherited from the dictatorship. In that vein,
also a culture promotes respect between people, organizations and

institutions; and social and political participation in decision-making processes that define the
life together.
a) According to the above, memory sites that subscribe to this document,
considered necessary the design, development and participatory policy implementation
Memory comprehensive public to consider the experience and contributions of the
organizations working memory sites. This public policy must meet
with:
b) Recognition of all sites of memory that are demanded by
social organizations, as a national monument; and recovery support delos
sites in all regions of the country.
c) To ensure the repair, maintenance, preservation and operation of sites
memory, based on the autonomy of social organizations that have
driven and sustained.
d) To ensure permanent funding through the annual budget law
national, for development work and projects that make memory sites.
e) Promotion of research and dissemination of knowledge about state violence,
Themes of memory and human rights; by providing public funds
for these purposes.
f)

Including visits to places of memory as part of the State educational program
for all levels of education.

g) It is also necessary that the public policy promotes advances in
truth and justice, particularly in relation to:
or

Openness and public access to all court records or State
ensuring public and dissemination of information access from sites
by heart.

or

Demands on the armed forces, police, investigative police and other
State institutions that deliver documentation relating to the period
militar dictatorship.

or

Full justice in all cases of state violence.

2.3 Transport Fair
Transportation is a key factor in how we relate to our
cities and urban spaces. Therefore, it is also essential for good living.
Until now, transport has not been taken as a right by capitalism to the chilean
way. Unlike. Since 1977, when the National Transport Company closed, it looks
merely as a service to be provided by associations first, from the transantiago by
private businesses. That is, by the market. Until then it was a problem of the state.
But today is a commodity.
In our government we will change this situation radically. Implement the
following measures:
a) will develop a transportation policy that puts the main concern
assurance of public transport for all citizens. Transport policies
neoliberal governments have based their proposals on private profitability
infrastructure projects. With this, the main benefit is guaranteed to those who invest.
Public concessions projects and transantiago are a sample of this model. For him
contrary, we will develop a model transport user benefits and
users.
b) Desincentivaremos car use by improving systems
public transport, non-polluting means of transport such as cycling and taxes
Specific private transport, which will fund the subsidy demand
transport.
c) The main benefit is allocated to the purchase of bikes by workers and
workers. It will be paid on condition of turning the bike in the middle of
daily transportation.
d) We will implement a program of public investment in transport infrastructure
without private contribution. The aim is to replace the system of concessions and public partnership
social with communities affected by the infrastructure.
e) projects and public infrastructure will be based on international experience and
communities to solve the problems. Urban motorways are no solution
transportation problems. Who will benefit from the infrastructure projects
affect a community must itself and in any case private interest. Since the
public transport routes to the need to implement new solutions
isolated areas within cities and regions should be discussed with the
involved and affected.

91

f) Create a public transportation agency to take charge of resolving
transport and connectivity problems in Santiago and regions, including the Metro and
allows that in the medium term with a system of freight and passengers, based
trains, trams and clean solutions.
g) We will encourage citizen participation in defining transport policies
national and regional. And affected communities must be the source of policies
transport for the product of these public investments ensure development
districts, communes and cities.
With these measures we hope to create a system of "fair Transport". Users and
users will have access to a transportation system in which different media
will ensure the possibility of moving to places of work, education, care
health, satisfaction of needs at a fair price according to the income of those who
It has fewer resources.

2.4 For a liberating culture
Cultural creation in Chile currently depends primarily on supply and
demand for cultural goods and services. Cultural creators, usually
individually, they can produce their works if they have access to financing obtained through
marketing of its creation. In other words, cultural creation in Chile is
left to market forces. Where and when the market fails, the state supplies the
demand for private funding cultural projects of various kinds. For this,
right-wing governments of the past 40 years have created what is now known
of "competitive grants". With that the state needs large patches
financing of cultural creation. But, in practice, that role, to generate
resources for the financing of cultural works, depends largely Exchange
unregulated commercial market of cultural goods and services. That is, today prevails
in Chile a neoliberal regime of cultural creation and consumption.
The neoliberal regime of creation and cultural consumption has imposed the rules of the
market. On the one hand, the subjects and the subject of cultural creation are
atomized act individually and 12, while on the other hand, a huge industry

12

Strictly speaking, all the decrees of the Ministry of Education to regulate the allocation of funds
contestable intended to allow cultural creation tant natural or legal persons
they can compete. This does not contradict but reinforces marke perspective that underlies
cultural policy in Chile. Hec ho, they can compete "natural persons" implies that the
funds are open to for-profit companies. This was explicitly set the same page
web of competitive funds: http://www.fondosdecultura.gob.cl/ayuda/preguntas-frecuent is /

92

concentrated and oligopolistic intermediaries (publishers, bookstores, record labels, producers, etc.)
controlled conditions and, especially, the trading price of the works by
general public, which is also composed of atomized individuals and poorly organized.
Generally, creators and cultural creators compete for access
intermediaries. The same applies to access to public funds: competition (or "contests"
as they are called) between cultural creators finite and limited funds.
Three of the fundamental principles of neoliberal organization of a market, then,
operate in the field of cultural creation: competition, fragmentation of supply and demand
aggregate and eventually high concentration of actors oligopolistic intermediaries
market.
The specific effects of the neoliberal regime of creation and cultural consumption are powered on
Chile by the educational system, whose training curriculum, especially at school level, is
especially poor in cultural content. Consequently, it is seen an ever
greater separation between high culture and popular culture, which can not be qualified by the
expansion of mass culture. High culture continues to play in groups
higher income, without adoption increases in society. Popular culture, meanwhile,
unable to penetrate mass culture survives more by inertia than by capacity
competitive.
Our proposal is to replace the neoliberal regime of cultural creation and consumption by one
it rests on different bases. Instead of competition, the new regime is based on
self-management. And instead of individual atomization of creators and cultural creators,
It proposes cooperation.
The replacement of the neoliberal regime with a new one is a long-term task that requires
over a period of government. Between 2014 and 2018, the government of Roxana Miranda give the
first steps. Will redefine the most fundamental public funds for
promotion of art, reading, theater, music, audiovisual production and culture
change its function and cultural actors who can access them. With this will begin
approach to replacing the current market for a cooperative approach and self-managing.
In the first approach, the subject of cultural creation is the individual artist. In the approach of
our public cultural policy, the subject will be organized people. In the first resource
for cultural creation are acquired through competition in the market or the
State grant funds. In the new approach, resources obtained through the
partnership and cooperation.
In terms of programs, the new approach means that resources will be eligible
oriented public cultural creation not individual artists or cultural creators, but
communities and grassroots organizations. The creators and cultural eligible for
integrating public funds to communities and social organizations that carry out projects
93

cultural. In this way they can develop their cultural creations while
involve communities and grassroots organizations and, through them, they contribute to the
massification of cultural creation.
To contribute to overcrowding and integration, at least 10% of the funds will go
projects aimed at people with visual capabilities and / or hearing different; at least
10% of the funds will go to projects of indigenous peoples and ancestral cultures; to the
least 10% will be destined to the promotion of urban folk art; and at least 10% is
intended for popular performing arts.
To combat the gentrification of high culture, the State shall establish organizations for
produce, reproduce and massively cultural creations:
a) A public publishing house specializing in the publication of print and digital works under
cost;
b) A public record producer for recording and playing of music;
c) A ballet and a youth orchestra for each region;
d) A museum of memory per commune.
e) To incorporate culture in the learning process, the compulsory subject will be created
"Appreciation of the culture." The course will be taught in every high school course.
Cultural development we propose will serve the development of counterhegemony
capitalist. Construction or development of cultural identity is not under any view
academic educational process but own and inherent human relations process
in its social dimension ranging equipping itself with symbolic and concrete shapes and structures
are ultimately forms of life that a human group designs in practice. And no
necessarily aware of this. Therefore, a primary task of development
organic culture is to show that culture and give it legitimacy inward and
outside.

Mysticism, aesthetics and sense of what we do has multiple forms of expression and not
only the captured or validated from the formality and limited expression playpen
norms and values ​​of others. A good artist, he is thought to who achieves location
Pyramid privilege in the art market.

94

That is true but for those who see or look through the prism of capital. But strictly speaking,
the artist who succeeds in translating his speech from art forms either from the dance,
theater, painting, music, literature and a large etcetera. Then also artists
from the everyday and from his experience creating and linking your creation achieved by other
excellence and / or perseverance of their efforts deserve and many more so, have a
place not only in the market but the expression of our struggles. Especially when
his art against all odds accompanying political efforts of our social struggles.
Therefore, secondly, a key task is to articulate the cultural development
popular artistic expression and other populations in an open alliance
permanent dialogue for the visibility of our artistic culture and
development through constructive management that encourages children, young and old
to express themselves through art.

3. Good living between nature and society
The basis of good living is to develop a harmonized and integrated relationship with nature. Far
instrumentalism of Eastern civilization, which sees nature as an enemy
defeat or as a commodity to be exploited, the paradigm of good living considered as a
central element of a comprehensive human life. Protect is part of the fight against
predatory capitalism.

3.1 Towards ecological harmony
The ecological situation in Chile is critical. Nature is being overfished at sea,
forests, hills, snow, lakes and rivers ... Taking a permissive regulation and
almost ornamental, capitalism is the way chilean preying everything
its path to rapidly generate profit before society ends
waking. Additionally, neoliberal governments have acted cunning and
unscrupulously against the environment and public health when big business to do so
he asked, as with AES Gener in Campiche. There are increasingly clear signs
the Chilean representation system is completely co-opted by capital
transnational environmental, among others.
There are several specific causes of the present ecological situation. Already proposed the main:
and ornamental permissive regulation, environmental institutions with scarcely
cooptable autonomous and easily. But it is also important the following reasons:
- An environmental assessment system which does not provide eco-systemic parameters and social
- Null popular participation in the process of environmental decision making

95

- Lack of rational planning of projects that have high economic exploitation
environmental impact
- Indirectly it has also affected the criminalization and violent repression against activists and
environmental fighters as a deterrent to projects with high resistance
environmental impact.
A harmonious relationship with nature is essential not only for the development of good
live, but also to overcome predatory capitalism. Therefore, the environmental problem is
of prime importance to our government. We will be relentless protecting our
natural heritage and put all popular power in the service of their care.
We develop a general framework to address all environmental situation to consider:
a) popular control over projects with environmental impact. Monitoring and subsequent reaction
They exerted by the community Freirina on the plant to be institutionalized AGROSUPER
follow the development of any project that affects the environment in which we live.
b) Natural resources will be managed by financial entities under popular control
(EEBCP).
c) We will reform the SEIA System (EIA) to be
intensive eco-systemic and social parameters.
d) A division of the Defender of the People of Chile will specialize in protecting
Environmental Rights
e) Establish penalties for regional political authorities and municipal officials
State to assume the role of "spokesmen", "propagandists" and agents 'facilitators' of
large projects with environmental impact.
f) Respect for indigenous and peasant communities.
No matter how fiscalicemos mega projects, important part of care
environment is related to economic development policy. Our government
develop a new production order based on a fair economy ed between beings
humans and their relationship with the environment, in order to prevent accumulation of capital. The
overcoming of capitalism is also a way to protect the environment.
Our environmental policy with each of our natural resources detailed
below.

96

3.1.1 Water
a) We will stop privatization and renacionalizaremos this as a strategic natural resource
While national in common use.
b) Up to leave Chilean territory, apply a "royalty" for the use of water to
mining companies.
We develop a state policy of sustainable management of water resources in accordance with the
different weather, rainfall and ecological zones of the country, involving:
-

Establish the availability and use of water resources as a major element in the
strategic planning of development in each region

-

its use must be addressed for human consumption as a key priority in the
appropriate conditions and qualities required, above all other economic activity.

-

Incorporated into the renovated Water Code (2005) established recommendations
in the "Social Water Charter" (2nd World Water Forum - The Hague), which considered the
water as a "social good of public use and use of privileged beings
human "rather than an economic commodity subject to the interests of big
industries.

-

Establish a "moratorium on the granting of water rights" in northern Chile,
applied to all surface waters and groundwater, until it is
set the actual availability of water for the population in the next 50 years.

c) demand that all projects using water resources (raw material, component or
production) input, it is subjected to an EIA, not one day.
d) In Chile 95% of the sewage no effective treatment. The waters
contaminated are partially cleared by the action of the sea and the cost is paid by the average
environment and consumers. Water companies must actually implement systems
wastewater treatment, not only primary (pouring sea water), also
secondary and tertiary if necessary, to enable water reuse benefit
live of the population and agricultural application, especially in areas of scarcity
water.
e) We will stop and will not apply projects seawater desalination, as causes
Large impacts playback capabilities of marine fauna, with a high
energy consumption and environmental pollution. Companies are trained and must
Required to develop and implement efficient operational savings schemes

97

f) will reverse the concessions and "privatization" of water companies made
during the neoliberal governments. They will become Economic Entities Under Control
Popular.
g) will regulate respect for ancestral rights over the waters by
indigenous peoples and be exempted from payment of license fees. We will prevail Indian Act
over the Water Code.
3.1.2 Fishing
a) will develop a sustainable policy on the exploitation of fishery resources
coastal regions, promoting small-scale fisheries and the Protection of the ARPA
(Restricted Area Artisanal Fishing), which is affected by the installation of mega
thermoelectric projects and industrial fishery, overexploitation and contaminates
fish stocks and banks benthic resources consumed by the population.
b) Derogaremos completely general law on fisheries and aquaculture in government approved
neoliberal Patricio Alwyn, the short fishing the 19,713 law that establishes the fishing quota, and
the "Longueira Law".
c) Establish mechanisms for the protection and survival of some specimens that
in a state of extinction.
d) shall limit and, where necessary, will ban trawling by
industrial ships, since this type of fishing is not selective propagation and damage
balance that must be our coastline located in the Pacific sector.

3.1.3 Agriculture
a) There is no control mechanisms in Chile on soil erosion, nor is a
impuldado mechanism of organic farming throughout the state. We develop one.
b) limit the use of pesticides that pollute and are harmful to health
workers / agricultural workers and / as nearby residents.
c) We will implement a program to control the monoculture that is sweeping the
hillsides in the country.
d) Promote crop rotation and diversification for the rest of the land

98

e) We will create agricultural colleges with state grant to develop proposals
agroecological.
f) We will create a regulation on deepening wells to ensure the stability of
water resource.
g) Promote the municipalities through the generation of popular urban gardens, with
agricultural inputs (seeds, ground sheet, humus).

3.1.4 Forest
a) We will change the law of native forest by a real law to protect forests,
Chile. Much of the native forests on private land, except for
which they are included in the National System of State Protected Wilderness Areas
(SNASPE). Consequently, the main direct actors of deforestation in the south
Chile are privately owned, and among them are forestry companies and
small farmers.
b) We will protect native specimens and even stop logging on private lands
c) Promote paper recycling campaigns and create Economic Entities Under
Popular Control of paper recycling in order to reduce forest plantations and logging
at country level.
d) Create a subsidy fund to encourage reforestation of native flora in the country.
e) We will implement advertising campaigns and infrastructure to reduce impacts
anthropic in native forests.
f) We will send to Congress a bill to protect coastal wetlands and high Andean for
protecting biodiversity and water resources.
g) In southern Chile have been installed companies have planted large areas of
monoculture exotic tree species, which has generated environmental consequences
negative. Bringing major consequences:
-

Deterioration of soil having no protection

-

Depletion of water resources

99

-

Severe loss of biodiversity

-

Health problems from pesticide use

We implement a reforestation program in those areas.
h) will regulate the supply, management and supply of forest plantations
help sustainable development and overcoming poverty

3.1.5 Mining
a) Derogaremos the treaty of integration and complementation Chile-Argentina mining and
the mountains to recover sovereignty of all Chileans.
b) we send to Congress a bill to protect glaciers and wetlands
Andean.
c) Create new regulation on mining activities in the mountain range that prevents
commence no authority lie inventories glaciers and periglacial environment is made.
d) Closure of mega projects and open pit mining chemistry in the mountains, in the
headwaters of the valleys and agricultural perimeters locations. The chemical mining has
negative environmental and social consequences as used contaminants such as cyanide,
mercury and arsenic, among others, to their processes. The operation involves open pit
the dynamiting of the range with irreparable losses to the natural and environmental heritage.
Also at high risk for the health of workers and inhabitants of the valleys.
e) We will take action against tailings left in the mountains, and that kill
flora, fauna and the ecosystem that supports life in the valleys (basins)
f) will prohibit the installation of toxic tailings in the headwaters of rivers and valleys.

3.1.6 Biodiversity:
a) We will create natural migration corridors and assisting particular species to
migrate

100

b) Support care meadows through an active selection of species
vegetables, control of animal populations and new grazing strategies
c) Recognize within the system of environmental assessment and marine invertebrates
terrestrial, as fundamental parts of biodiversity.
d) Increase the coverage of protected areas in Chile, emphasizing the area
Central, being part of a hotspot.

biodiversity, taking into account the ecosystem services provided by these systems
natural.
g) In places where large industries are installed disrupting biodiversity and
the natural system will regulate pollutant emissions and wastes emanating.
h) will allocate sufficient resources for the effective and full implementation of areas
protected.
i) include in community development plans to protect biodiversity, for use
common and sustainable.

3.1.7 Use fuel

c) Increase public investment in fuel
dependence of the great powers.

long-term leave

d) explore the possibility of using more efficient means of transport, such as trains
rapids.
e) will generate greater control in fossil fuel caches.

3.2. Towards an energy revolution
For the Equality Party and organizations have proclaimed as their Roxana Miranda
candidate overcome the current Chilean capitalist society, which is the project that is
driving from the movements of people, students and workers, is
necessary consequence a radical change in how we solve the problem
generate, distribute and consume energy. Neoliberalism has pushed to develop Chile
dirty "energy matrix", face, oligopólicamente controlled by a few groups
economic, designed as the capital of the great extractive services and capital, without
competition and organized participation of society in the design, implementation and
control of power generation projects.
The Society of the good life that will begin to build from March 11, 2014
You have an "energy matrix" that is at odds with the current. It will clean and
respect the rights of mother earth, economic, designed to suit the needs
Household and projects designed to generate the participation of
communities and popular power tools, mainly assemblies
permanent.
Energy is a major Achilles heels of Chilean neoliberalism. The way
is resolved energy demand in recent decades has five large
vices:
- The energy system is governed by laws of supply and demand, not by planning
- The energy market is almost entirely privatized; in some sectors, such as
electric, it is privatized 100%
- The generation and transmission markets are oligopolistic and highly concentrated;
- The energy system is highly vulnerable and dependent on imports
- The private operators are left with stratospheric profits due to model
marginal pricing of energy. That is, the operators generate enormous
utilities paid by the consumer or the end consumer.
A system with these characteristics produce energy in highly unfavorable conditions
for the population. For starters, it generates and distributes energy, primarily electricity,
that is among the most expensive in the world, which mainly affects people
lower incomes. Second, the large profits guaranteed by the concentration

102

oligopoly and regulation designed to discourage operators for investment
intended to reduce costs of production and distribution, leaving the system in conditions
High vulnerabiliad. Third, unless there is economic crisis, demand
installed capacity exceeds energy and imported energy. Finally, synergy
between high marketing costs, high profits, zero reinvestment obligations and
total lack of planning creates an incentive to exploit energy sources
cheap, mainly derived from coal in the power sector. These sources,
of course, they are the dirtiest and harmful to the environment.
The severe energy situation in Chile is exacerbated by the proliferation of large projects
mining and logging that, little by little, have begun to absorb much of the
production capacity and import of energy. As you can see in Figure 1, the
industrial and mining consumption (red line), which was the fourth largest source of demand in 2005
energy in 2010 was the second, after the final energy consumption by the
energy consumption of Transfer Centers. Between 2002 and 2011, the demand for
Energy increased by 25%. This increase was surpassed only by registered
by end-use sector (26%).

The combination of the neoliberal model in the management of the energy system and null
Chilean protections on natural resources that allow the installation of projects
103

extractive and logging in intensive use of energy can get to generate a
major supply crisis without corrective measures are not introduced into the system.
Authorities and economic groups have chosen to solve the problems of a matrix
dirty, inefficient and loss-developing electric energy mega-projects in the basins
water in southern Chile. These mega-projects, of course, if carried out, will
controlled by large economic groups and not by the people of Chile. But what is worse:
destroy ancient ecosystems and natural heritage, although in Chilean territory, is
of humanity as a whole, our, our sons and our daughters, our granddaughters
and our granddaughters.
Several studies have shown that more than 50 power generation projects
that are to be installed by the year 2015 (28 of them coal-fired power cycle
Combined: gas / oil) contribute about 17,600 megawatts, and 40% of energy to spare.
This is not understood is unknown if there are large deposits of coal in the south
Southern owned by members of the political class, that need to be exploited. Despite
that over-over, many poor and rural households continue like today without
electricity, because they will not have money to pay, neither the state nor provide the resources or
fix the fees that we have to charge utilities.
To make matters worse, most of energy projects in the country develop through
ignore the will of the affected communities. The mechanisms of "participation
citizen "are rather ornamental for lack of deliberative and decision-making powers.
Therefore, their interests are not represented in the decision-making process. Y
Nor they have the resources to lobby with the associated capital
energy system operators. Energy projects being implemented in Chile,
therefore, they tend to reflect lobbying capacity of agro-extractive capital and silvoexportador and not the interests of the communities affected by them.
The draft Equality Party and all organizations that have proclaimed Roxana
Miranda as its candidate is long-winded and has a clear purpose: to replace the organization
Chilean capitalist society for a non-capitalist society that pursues the good life and
which the people send. That, in energy, has very concrete consequences.
With the takeover of the entire extractive industry by the people's power will be reduced and
will control production to manage the world price through a planned offering,
thereby increase the country's income and tax revenue, and eventually reduce demand
energy and load on the environment.
In the period of government 2014 - 2018 will begin the first steps to move in that
objective. In the energy sector, progress will be made in the development of an energy matrix that is
hold on fundamental principles of good living:
a) Balance and harmony between human and environmental needs
104

b) The centrality of the person and human dignity and not private profit or value (of
change)
c) The community and the people as protagonists of decisions
d) The solidarity among peoples
These principles will be effective through six measures and policies:
a) Replacement of marginal pricing model regulated by one.
b) Modification of the law 20,527 to increase the share of renewable energies No
In the composition of conventional energy supplies 10% (current target) to 25%
2025.
c) Arrange a law on "popular participation in the decision-making process in
environmental project. " The law will allow:
i) energy to think and solve problems in office conditions
local and regional. The projects are designed to address national problems
They are large, with large costs with greater environmental impacts large.
To a large extent, the current energy situation is the result of this form of face
need for energy, primarily electricity.
ii) Implement the Convention 169 of the ILO and grant the right to speak and vote at the
communities affected by energy projects. This will be the first step towards
popular control of decision-making on energy. AND allow
introducing a human rights perspective in these projects.
iii) To allow communities to demand and manage the installation of plants
I pass. The objective of this measure is to redefine the current criterion satisfaction
demand: from the mega-projects that benefit large capital to small
hydroelectric projects to benefit communities.
d) Improving the policy of subsidizing the sale of dry wood to finish out of the market
the damp wood. The existing subsidies for consumption and extend to small businesses.
e) Develop the new doctrine of International Relations of the Peoples policy
energy integration with our neighbors and, where possible, with other peoples
of the Americas, rooted in the principles of solidarity, complemetareidad,
reciprocity and equivalence economy.

105

f) Generate an inventory to quantify the Latin American natural resources (energy)
in order to create institutional instruments for research, planning, development and
conservation of energy resources at regional level.

3.3 The animal rights 13
One of the most played around the animal themed entertainment, is its
use in circuses. The animalistic have already acted on it, creating a draft
modification of law to law No. 20,216, which provides benefits to the Chilean circus.
No. 20,216, Law published September 27, 2007, which establishes standards
promotion and protection of the Chilean circus, provides in its Article 2 understand what circus.
He states that those establishments are preferably enabled in tents,
duly authorized, they are intended for the celebration of circus and whose
programming is mainly aimed at children. It also adds that the term
circus performance or public performance of acrobatic exercise
or ability, performance of clowns, jugglers, magicians and illusionists, musicians,
and trained animals like.
Article 3 of the same Act provides that the national authorities,
regional and community should provide the necessary powers and take action as
may correspond to promote the activities of the Chilean circus in his capacity as instrument
of entertainment, recreation and cultural training. However, civil society has made
various complaints and demonstrations, both against the mistreatment of animals in the
circuses as opposed to the poor conditions of their maintenance by
circus throughout the national territory establishments, even though more than a hundred circuses
in our country only eight animals still continue to function. Whereas
circuses programming is mainly aimed at children, it is counterproductive
form early on a utilitarian culture that subjugates the dignity and rights
Animal intrinsic entertainment arising out of their use, regardless of
denaturing conditions and abuse, both physical and psychological, to which
are subjected.
Having this background, it is extremely serious that many of the species used in
This kind of shows are in danger of extinction. The extraction of these
species of nature per se is not only a process of significant deterioration for
each animal, precluding their natural social and cognitive development, but also involves
legal, and certainly effective way, to the extinction of these species and perpetually

The following proposal was watered ent Roxana Miranda by various groups and associations
specialized in the protection of animals. His candidacy was committed to his and hac erla
defend where necessary.

106

irrevocable. We also know that the use of certain species will directly
contravention of the provisions of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
I threatened of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), ratified by Chile on 14 February
1975 by Decree Law No. 875. This agreement is binding on each
state that subscribes as part.
The main problem of keeping wild animals in captivity is that development
nature of each specimen, as a true individual, is truncated at all levels. Yet
It arises when the needs of the animals are met fall into the great
negligence to ignore the adverse impact of the deficiencies of the physical and social environment in the
quality of life of them. Captive animals are affected by extreme boredom,
lack of proper exercise, low nutritional quality and lack of food variety,
enclosures especially neglected. Because the development of their natural instincts and
intrinsic behavior has been stunted prematurely, animals in captivity are
released are unable to act normally in nature; often they diverted
their energies and anxieties in stereotypical behaviors are not evident in animals
wild. Clear example is the case of wild tigers: generally spend ten
hours a day hunting or monitoring their territory, but those empelados in shows
circus, unable to perform these activities, release their energy calculating steps
given in their cages.
Faced with a problem that is repeated year after year, it is inappropriate to continue legitimizing,
as a sovereign state, and conduct activities contrary to the inherent rights of
animal, degrading his status as beings worthy of consideration and respect for mere
entertainment objects. It is therefore necessary that Chile progress in protecting and
animal rights, as they have done Hungary, Belgium, Austria, Finland, India,
Singapore, Israel, Sweden, Denmark, Costa Rica, Bolivia and Colombia prohibiting the use of
animals in circuses.
In Bulletin 6636-06, issued in 2009 in Chile, we proposed the following:

BILL
SOLE ARTICLE: Amend Law No. 20,216, which provides benefits for the circus
Chilean follows:
1. Delete the phrase "trained animals" the first paragraph of Article 2 of that
legal body.
2. Add the following paragraph at the end of Article 2 of the legal body:

107

The entry, movement and function is prohibited in the entire national territory
including establishments circus animals, both wild and domestic, in
magic tricks, acrobatics, exhibitions or services to the public,
this practice considered an act of cruelty against them. Failure imposed
the confiscation of animals, without prejudice to civil or criminal action corresponding to these
behaviors.

TRANSITIONAL ARTICLES:
Article 1 .- Circuses have a term of one year from the enactment of this draft
law to adapt their shows around the country. To this end, and in accordance with the
Article 3 of Law No. 20,216, Ley national, regional and municipal authorities should
provide the necessary and sufficient powers and take all measures
may correspond to ensure compliance with this law.
Article 2 .- are repealed all provisions contrary to this law.
Article 3 .- The authorities named in Article 3 of the legal body modified, Law
Benefits 20,216 Chilean circus, should adjust their regulations, including
regulations containing provisions, procedures and sanctions, within no more than
90 days, from the enactment of this Act.

108

Since processing other fibers and the development of the textile industry,
skins have gone from being a necessity to be considered as a symbol of status and power
today is strongly challenged by being cruel and used only for luxury.
Every year, millions of animals are killed for their fur foxes, chinchillas,
martens, minks, ferrets, seals, crocodiles, snakes, sheep, beavers, raccoons,
rabbits, stoats, kangaroos, wolves, lynxes, ocelots, antelopes, and even dogs and cats, among
others. These animals are bred in hatcheries furriers or captured directly from the
nature, either through hunting (known worldwide as the seal hunt
held annually in Canada) or the capture in traps. Although the hunt
It represents only 5% of the animals that the industry benefits, the remaining 95% comes
his upbringing, manipulation and death in farms furriers, for his "production" is more
cheap and optimizing its use when their skins tone and similar quality.
Since 95% of fur production is done in farms furriers, the largest
number of animals are concentrated within its walls and cages, where they live lives
miserable, imprisoned and denied their most basic instincts, to be slain
when they reach the appropriate weight and size.
In breeding, the animals are kept confined in a tiny space,
separated from their congeners by fences, and where they can not perform their own activities and
his instinctive species (digging holes in the ground, climb trees, run, hunt or gather,
socializing, etc.).
They are fed with pellets specially designed to accelerate growth and
improve conditions for their fur, they are immunized against diseases that occur only
when so many animals indiscriminately agglomerates, and manipulated
genetically to raise less aggressive, more uniform skin or individuals.
Under these conditions, when they reach live long enough, crazy animals
the physical and psychological suffering that implies they can not live in freedom, self-mutilate, the
mothers eat their young or abort early, develop stereotyped movements,
etc.
Sacrifice is the end point, too harsh and painful for these fashion victims:
They are asphyxiated with carbon monoxide, desnucados, anally electrocuted, oral and
vaginal, chloral hydrate injected or gassed, according to the characteristics of each
species. These techniques allow the unconscious animal to maintain body heat
Animal and facilitate the removal of the skin, the animals remain conscious when
descuero process.

109

The fur reality in Chile
In our country, there are about 100 farms furriers chinchillas and others
animals. These establishments are authorized by the SAG, there is a law to audit
This item nor against it. Through the transparency law, our organization
You have had access to the amount of fur bearers possibly breeding farms, service
livestock farming does not have a separate distinction for the type of item hatcheries.
The register of the fur farms has been possible thanks to our research and
infiltrations.
The oldest and largest industry, Chinchilla
The Chilean government of Juan Luis Sanfuentes was the first precursor of the industry
fur in Chile and the world, after raising authorize Mathias Chapman chinchillas
captivity and 12 chinchillas transfer to California, USA, where up successfully in 1923.
The Chinchilla is a Chilean species, which is in serious risk of extinction
wild due to indiscriminate hunting to which he was subjected in the past and today
It has only changed the scenario but it continues to operate. It is a classic case of an animal
humans want to protect after endangered, and perhaps when it is
too late. Chinchilla is under the aegis of international conventions, and that
it is included in Appendix I of CITES, the resolution only protects the free species
nature, but not to the generations born in captivity and furriers purposes
mascotería.
Currently, there is "the Chinchillas National Reserve", which aims
protect the last wild chinchillas and education to the community about
protection of this endangered species, however, the book does not educate on
another reality of this species exploited in Chile with furriers purposes and how this
industry has been responsible for reducing the population of this species in the
today. The reserve receives funds from the "World Council of the Chinchilla" advice
Chinchilla gathers breeders in the world in order to protect industry and finance
projects future entrepreneurs to successfully bring the fur category. We believe there
conflicting interests on the part of the reservation to receive funds from a council that is dedicated to
develop and protect the industry questioning of society, which is why the
Booking not educated the other reality of this Chilean rodent exploded 60 years ago.
Chilean farmers gather at the "National Institute of Chinchilla" organization
without legal personality that he is dedicated to developing business in Chile. Families more
powerful and represent the institute and world council are: Holzer, Kauer, Ittomi. He
furrier business is familiar and inheritable level, does not generate large employment opportunities,
since the category is mainly driven by members of the family and is camouflaged is
mainly rural or remote areas.
110

The animals are treated with agents for improving skin and maturation
ahead of the coat. Within the research we have done, we could see that
medicines for humans are used as simvastatin authorized for use in
animals and Ralgro, anabolic commonly used in the livestock industry. One of the
cases that struck us was finding medical shows of simvastatin used
a furrier florida farm, which we implied that there is a potential traffic
medications, because, as these medical samples are obtained through professional
medicine.
Pollution of the fur industry
The process of fur production is highly detrimental to the environment. Is
intensely polluting, it consumes large amounts of energy and may cause chaos
in the ecosystem.
Water Pollution: The animal wastes contain high
concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus. If they are not handled properly, these
chemicals in waste confinement operations pollute systems
local surface water through the drain and leaching. If present in amounts
eutrophication large enough nitrogen leads to decreasing
oxygen levels which ends up killing the fish.
Air Pollution: In addition to air pollution by gases arises
released through manure, major air pollutants are released into the discard
animal carcasses through incineration, one of the most common methods. Inside
contaminants can include carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, dioxide
sulfur, hydrochloric acid, volatile organic compounds, dioxins and heavy metals.
Soil Pollution: Some breeders dismiss the flayed corpses
pits in his private area and in areas near the community where it is a potential source
infectious organic waste.
How serious is the pollution generated by the fur industry?
The European Commission and the Department of Control Prevention
Pollution 2003 recognizes the tanning industry as "an industry
potentially severe in pollution. " The Pollution Projection System
Industrial qualifies the tanning industry as one of the five worst industries
contaminated with toxic metals earth. In 1991 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
He fined $ 2.2 million to six processing plants pollution skins
They caused, stating that "the solvents used in these operations can cause
respiratory problems and are registered as carcinogenic potential ". Likewise the
Chinese government demonstrates worried about pollution caused by this
111

industry. In 2007, the publication The Trapper & Predatos Caller reported that China was
considering imposing a punitive tax as a measure to penalize industries
that they are causing excessive pollution. "
Common methods used in the tanning of the skins used formaldehyde
chromium; chemicals that are registered as so many carcinogenic and toxic to
humans. Other chemicals used in tanning or issued by the same process and that
They appear in more than one US government list of toxic chemicals include
aluminum, ammonia, chlorine, chlorobenzene, copper, ethylene glycol, lead, methanol, naphthalene acid
sulfuric, toluene and zinc.
Fur trade
Skins produced in Chilean hatcheries are exported abroad, only
10% of these skins are sold to designers and shops. There is an awareness
important among citizens about the use of fur as contributing to the business through
cart. Products made from animal skins are of limited access due to high
costs are products to the highest strata of society. Business success
It goes to the export of skins to countries where demand has remained fur
during the period mainly due to the clean image. The import of fur from other
countries like Argentina is distributed in stores mainly in the districts of greater power
purchasing in different cities.
Hunting, an activity that encourages fur
The hunting of certain animals is carried out for their fur are
used by the fur. The so-called "pests" such as mink and beaver were introduced
pelífera the country for exploitation; unsuccessful business in the 50s after the failure
estimated breeders released these animals to nature, since the introduction of
these animals was for exploitation. The introduction of non-endemic and native species
the country generates a risk to ecosystems, which is the leading cause of overpopulation
species called "pests".
The Livestock Service encourages fur to pay $ 2,500 for each queue and
beaver and mink skins, as this organization has used to control
overpopulation of these animals. These measures are patch if this solution
body continues to authorize the introduction of species to our country. The nature and
species are controlled themselves, when there is an imbalance usually caused by
human intervention.

112

Ethics and the immorality of the fur industry
Thousands of years ago humans depended on the use of skins to protect their
physical integrity and combat environmental conditions, the absence of technology and
knowledge to make synthetic fibers. It is ethically regressive when using animals
there is no real need to do so and synthetic alternatives offered by the market.
A variety of measures prohibiting the use in almost all aspects of
human activities affecting the animals: these include the use of animals in
trade, agriculture, research, entertainment, and even comrades
domestic. Far from being ethically regressive, there is an overwhelming acceptance
It indicates that these developments lead to a civilized society. These developments have been
philosophically supported by a growing perception that society has a
clear responsibility as to abolish acts of cruelty to animals. You are not alone
wrong to hurt animals, but humans themselves would benefit from living in a
not speciesist society where cruelty and property status is an activity that the law
should discourage and punish.
The latest research and famously declared recognize Cambridge
existence of consciousness in animals, allowing the consciousness of his own existence,
feelings, thoughts, environments, etc.

The ethical principle of equality
The ethical principle of equality before notes that two individuals with the same
interest, such interest will be assessed for both individuals alike, regardless of
irrelevant characteristics: if a man and a woman have the same interest, for example,
feel loved, the interest of each will be assessed in the same way without paying
attention to sex they belong to. This principle also applies to individuals of different
races, for example, requesting not to be killed is the same regardless of the subject
is of African or Asian origin, and therefore is equally unfair to kill either.
Those who believe in animal rights apply the same principle to individuals
of different species: for example, because an animal is so keen to avoid becoming a victim
torture as a human, is so unjust cause suffering to one as it is to provocárselo
other.
Therefore, race, sex, species, intelligence or sexual orientation are traits
irrelevant of an individual and, according to the ethical principle of equality, should be treated as
such when assessing their interests.

113

Proposals to abolish the fur market in Chile
Our position is unanimous abolish the fur industry in Chile. Our position plus
ethical considerations on which it is based first of all, is further argued that the
furriers companies are familial and hereditary character does not generate jobs for its
communities and generate wealth for the country. They are the core of infectious foci for
surrounding communities generate large organic waste and chemicals that affect
environment.

In that vein, our proposals on the fur industry are:
•

Prohibit the fur farms across the country, breeding, trading and death of
animals exclusively with furriers purposes.

•

Prohibit the export and import of fur in the country and its sale.

•

Create public policies to educate the public about synthetic alternatives
It provides the market and the reality that involves buying furs.

•

Prohibit the introduction of foreign species into the country as preventing future and
Possible pests, this would reduce the hunting of animals for their fur.

•

Ban all marketing of Chinchilla, such as in pet stores,
Internet and private. The sale of this kind generates finance industry
fur, since the supplied come from fur-bearing animals which have breeding
sold by damage to the coat.

•

The animals seized from farms furriers must be relocated in
sanctuaries or placed for adoption with the help, supervision and advice from organizations
pro-animal rights and understood in the fur business in Chile.

With regard to the Hunting Act, our proposal aims:
•

Within the general framework, the first thing is to clarify, refine or expand certain concepts
published in the current hunting law with the consensus of the organizations for the
114

animal rights, as well as introducing other concepts in order to prevent and
remove ambiguities and empty Gone to allow the animals qualify for the benefit of
operator.
•

Ban the introduction of alien species, many of which are
interned for commercial exploitation and are then released
uncontrollably, becoming a "plague" and wreaking havoc among the
native species.

•

Conduct a regional land with introduced species causing more difficulties
in the respective ecosystems they inhabit, measuring both the difficulty
cause to native species in the area as the negative impact on
surrounding communities. This land should be updated every two years.

•

Use sterilization as a method of pest control and introduced species
no hunting or mass destruction of animals. It is shown that it is effective
slaughter of animals to control overpopulation of species.

•

Relocating to pests in their native habitat in the same country and possibly in
Outside in the case of non-native species in our country. A second alternative
to create or use protective shrines, which have a potential for tourism and
education so they can maintain over time. Any contribution is private
welcome, but these should be reviewed to avoid any conflict of
interest and companies that are not involved in cases of exploitation and
animal abuse.

•

Campaign focused civic education in rural areas, for
show people that there are different options most beneficial control
more effective than the extermination and expulsion, the position in favor of rights
animals is not "place animals over people," as is often
misinterpreted, but getting both human rights are respected as the
animal rights. In addition, the campaign will focus on education
eliminate the concept of "sport" hunting as a healthy and safe activity.

Considering the serious problem affecting our country in relation to the
overcrowding of animals, commonly known as domestic, recognized as
company for the population, it is important to clarify the following points as
we need to analyze organization to solve the existing problem and give a real
defense and protection of animals.

Education Program nationally in all educational establishments
Chile
It is urgent that the Chilean society is educated about responsible pet ownership
from an early age into educational establishments. It is paramount
recognize that our relationship with animals is historic and that without the basics
cruelty to animals day after day seriously endangering intensify sensitivity
of the population on such a common theme, sharing with animals as sentient as
we.
Education on responsible ownership in Chile should not be subject to segregation
social, economic, nor religious or political. Everyone has the right to educate
on how to respect animals and then act on what they learned, what
will enhance our human, family, social and civic development.

End the Purchase and Sale of animals
One of the factors that worsen the situation are the marketers of animals,
shops and individuals that reproduce without measuring consequences canine species,
resulting in a serious setback since the number of animals for this purpose is
nor typified as to have a history in this regard.
It is essential to recognize the reasons why we must reject the purchase and sale
animal, for further accentuates the problem of overpopulation of these. Abuse
animal that exists behind breeding and pet stores in Chile is unknown, but
According to international research the reality is grim. Animals are converted
bearing in machines and production facilities, which is a serious violation of
life of these animals.
It is important that the Chilean government and the legislature prioritize the elimination of
buying and selling animals by law, both farms, pet shops,
supermarkets, internet and in public permanently without any revocation.

117

Ethical and humanitarian ordinances for animals in all communes in Chile
It is essential that each municipality of the country with its people manage
the animal control issue in the best way possible, considering concepts
humanitarian and ethical, rejecting practices such as mass removal, euthanasia without grounds
apparent that alter the healthy life of animals. But considering sterilization as
social and humanitarian concept, added to the general rejection of neglect and mistreatment
animals. It is important that each municipality in their prime interest reporting and audit
each case that damage and affect animal life in their commune, implementing programs
canine and feline municipal supervisory control intended for this purpose and these
have the powers that the law grants them. So it is urgent to amend the current Act
Animal protection.

Free and compulsory sterilization for all animals.
The Chilean State must include in their portfolios resource utilization
tax for use in nationwide mass sterilization, these are gradual,
systematic, continuous and free access to the entire population, without discrimination
social or economic sectors.
Sterilization is today the only existing solution in the world to end
proliferation of animals. It is the task of the State and NGOs transforming the sterilization as a
social concept rather than a veterinary clinician concept because sterilization resolved
social, environmental, educational conflicts, promoting health, order and progress
of society and all its inhabitants.

Criminalization of neglect and mistreatment of animals. Tougher penalties and
convictions in cases of animal cruelty
Today, the Animal Protection Act is merely a declaration of intent
at the legislative level that even proposes "des" animal protection, which is serious and
You should be changed as soon as possible.
Considering the evolution of societies and the development of these, we must ensure
the interests of the animals to be in accordance with the socio-cultural level our
country acquires according to the progress of our civilization. In response, the respect for animals

118

should be an obligation and abuse towards them should be considered a serious offense, as it
He is attacking the integrity of sensitive and sentient beings.
It is the responsibility of the state and our Legislators propose an initiative
criminalizing neglect and mistreatment of animals, also the hardening of fines and
convictions in cases of animal cruelty. With the above is to ensure that the
defendants involved in cases of animal cruelty are not an influence on the population,
to prevent crimes such as these, which are now very common, but not penalized.
The points discussed above reflect a widespread interest Society
according to what is required for animals to public policy level, because thanks to a
early intervention is possible that we may have in the near future a reality
very different from the one we live daily, where animals are mistreated every second,
abandoned by the thousands in the streets, fields and vacant lots, treated as objects
Cruel entertainment, hunted, trapped, poisoned and maimed for human entertainment.
It is urgent intervention of our authorities so that the animals have a
better future and we can teach our future generations that their
yes contemporaries fought for them.
Ethical arguments to end the rodeo
The rodeo is a practice forged many years ago, records and knowledge of their
beginning in the sixteenth century, where the movement of animals mainly cattle, was an activity
recurring, especially to mark and select. Over the years, the practice became
a mandatory instance, implementing certain obligatoriness, such as the use of riders
and specially trained horses.
Rodeo regulation, ending the seventeenth century, fixed the way it develops
activity today, at that time the riders exposed reins movement on a
horse time to bring the cattle in the corrals, forcing both the horse and the
bull, to be part of this activity within a certain perimeter. For this period the
rodeo took place on a rectangular field, making difficult the management of
animals, causing them serious accidents, which often meant her death.
During 1961 and 1962, the rodeo is formalized as a national sport, being
representative for all but statistically there is no official reference that,
the formalization is done legally by office No. 269 of the National Sports Council
and Olympic Committee of Chile.
The rodeo is currently carried out in a crescent, physical establishment
develop, with two riders participate on two horses called colletas who

119

They should guide a bull and hit a thatch to stop, depending on location
physical in which he hit the bull on the thatch, you will be assigned a certain point. He
apiñadero part in the beginning where the riders on horses, awaiting departure bull,
the apiñadero has a small curvature and a diameter of only 13 meters with two doors
They give to the court. Here the bull is mobilized and agitated violently searching
have an outlet to the court as quickly as possible, preventing the animal to stop and avoid
being hit in the quinchas, can this action only lasts a few minutes, cause
serious injuries and stress in the animal, injury can result from the same bars
input and output which hits being mobilized to give movement, these are not
padded. Previous years, the choice of animal for the race, it became part of the
colleras same today remain located in corrals near the crescent
and they are randomly chosen.
The race is the next step to remove the animal from apiñadero, consisting give two
three laps around the court depending on the type of rodeo to be exercised on the occasion, each
Back mean the coup in quinchas by horses toward the bull who is
whipped therein. Rodeo Federation by regulation, assign 4 locations
the animal that they meant 4 different scores depending on where the stroke occurs and
it stops the animal. To compute a term that is parried by the described known
earlier-the horse must remain perpendicular to steer, therefore there must be a
strong dominance over the horse rider, there are cases of profuse wounds in these
animals due to the excessive force of espuelazos.
Places to every save of the bull are divided into four, according to the rules
Officer runs cows, zero points for '' wrap '' place assigned from head to
the animal's neck, '' free Cogote '' assigned two points and this place s located from its legs
tired front top of its back, '' free Palette '' places the sector ribs
part of the back of the animal, between the front and hind legs, assigned 3 points for this
industry, '' Costilla free '' is the share from the hind legs to his back
placing tail and udder giving 4 points to the collar.
Background prohibitions
Several related background activities called bans
by his fans as "traditions" and / or "sports," and can serve as an argument
to support a possible ban on the activity of the Rodeo.
1. Related to ban circuses that use animals, most recently in June
2013 was legislated in favor of the ban on animal circuses in Colombia. Is
ban is effective from 2015.
2. Related to ban bullfighting, the autonomous province of Catalonia,
in Spain, he banned bullfighting by a law which came into force on 01
120

an0 January 2012. Mexico also were banned bullfighting in
municipalities of Sonora (May 2013) and Veracruz (June 2013).
3. Without hesitation, the most important precedent is related to the ban on hunting
foxes with dogs in England and Wales from February 2005, activity called
as "sport" already banned in Scotland since 2002. The ban of this tradition
centennial, begun in the s. XVII, it was preferred as an alternative by the representatives of the
House of Commons to proposals for self-regulation of this practice and the system
licenses. In this regard, former Conservative minister Michael Howard accused the Interior
Labour Executive to abolish an "activity which has been legal since time immemorial"
while adhering to this practice also blamed job losses due to the
ban the sport. While this stance against the deputy said
Labour Michael Foster, who argued that fox hunting "is cruel and unnecessary and it's time
to stop this practice. "
Analysis of the Legal Status of Rodeo
1. The Chilean Rodeo Federation an organization that develops activities rodeo,
bull cow rein movement and other "sports" obtained ecuestres-
Legal personality of the Ministry of Justice on September 26, 1961 (Decree No.
4008). It is, then, a private corporation (legal entity).
2. The Chilean Rodeo Federation affiliated to the National Sports Council from 27
December 1961. From that date it is, then, a law corporation
private (corporate) whose core business is the development of a particular "sport."
3. The Chilean Rodeo Federation is governed by the Statutes and Regulations
Federation itself. In this sense, to date, there is no special law regulating this
activity.
4. Moreover, the Law on Animal Protection (Law No. 20,380, of October 3, 2010)
Article 16 (Title VII, "Miscellaneous Provisions") provides:
"The provisions of this Act not to sports involving animals, such as apply
rodeo, bull, cow, rein movement and equestrian sports, which
shall be governed by their respective regulations. "
5. The hierarchy of norms is clear in establishing that the laws (normal) fall
on regulations. Therefore, at least in principle, be-any regulations its
nature- can not be exempted from the legal regulation.

121

6. In this regard, the activities developed by the Federation of Chilean Roundup, corporation
which is regulated by a regulation, they can not be exempted from the legal regulation.
7. Therefore, the rodeo as "sports" activity -developed by the Federation and
mencionada-, can not be exempt from regulation by way of the Law on Animal Protection,
and in particular Article 291 bis of the Penal Code which penalizes abuse and cruelty
animals (this also was amended by the Law on Animal Protection).
8. Clearly, the provisions of Article 16 already mentioned, due to protection
policy by those legislators who support and participate in the activity of the rodeo.
In conclusion
This activity can not be exempt from the regulation of animal protection exists
in our country for the reasons already set. This will only be achieved by removing the condition
National sport. Not being exempted by the animal protection law, the rodeo inevitably
It should be prohibited by an activity that falls within the criminal type
abuse or cruelty to animals.

No More Vivisection intended the term animal experiments, as
We consider it unethical practices used in these beings who are capable of feeling.
For this, we carry out various activities ranging from educational lectures and protests to
investigations. Through this document, we present our proposal for
ban on animal testing for cosmetics manufacturing and sale of this
type of products that have been tested on animals.
Currently, animal tests are done in different areas and one of the most
important in terms of its magnitude is the cosmetics industry, either because legislation
is the local demand or because they do not officially prohibited, which in practice is
permissive. In the absence of rigorous ethical discussions about or maintain certain gaps
legal product of the same lack, some companies may still opt for this
research method. However, the experiments in this area are aimed at
disappear after the European Union made a change in its security regulations
in cosmetics, prohibiting animal testing, in addition to refuse the sale of products
i cosmetics tested on animals since March this year.
In Chile, the Regulations of the National Control System ii Cosmetics, Ministry
Health, does not require animal testing to demonstrate the safety of a product.
While no one is required to do, in our country there is still the possibility that
any company or try cosmetics ingredients on animals. Due to the
above, we consider necessary to prohibit these practices, using as argument the
following:
1. At this time, anyone can make animal testing for the development of
cosmetics. If it is prohibited by current regulations, it is definitively closes
door to this kind of research is conducted in our country.
2. Animal testing for cosmetics has been replaced by
highly reliable and very widespread use at present methods. In fact, they are
the only methods allowed in Europe today.
3. A modification of this kind in the regulation would be an upgrade to the
Chilean regulations, putting it on par with the regulations of the European Union. Yes
We believe that consumers are increasingly concerned about the impact
that generate habits, it will be something positive for the domestic industry because it would have a
hallmark since its inception.
4. That prohibition would be a pioneer in Latin America. This would put the authorities and
national standards at the forefront in the region and encourage more countries
follow the same steps.

5. The animals are capable of feeling and awareness siiii, so all activity
that involves our should be revised. A ban on animal testing
for cosmetics would be a step towards developing an ethical and responsible economy.
Of course we express our full support and willingness to cooperate in discussion and
analysis for implementation.
