20 priorities
to reform
Italy
Italian dear, dear Italians,
for over a year so many of you, meeting me as Chairman of the Board
the street or on public occasions, encouraged me, telling me: "Go
forward. "
So I decided to have a political role in the fear that the sacrifices, made with great
maturity by families, workers, young people and businesses to bring Italy out
from emergency during my government, they were burned in a few months in a bonfire
of election promises.
In 15 months in office have removed the country from emergency crisis, our
balance sheet is solid, we have restored Italy's international credibility and above
we did it by themselves, without the need for aid and international supervision.
We have initiated radical reforms, from work to justice, that they could
be deeper if they had not met with resistance on the left and right
in Parliament. These reforms alone will contribute to a growth of 6%
GDP in five years. Everyone says that reforms are urgently needed, but that in
20 years nobody has had the courage to do.
Now I fight to change the composition of Parliament with the entry of
Civil society, to overcome the opposition between the two poles and join forces
reformers. To go ahead and pick up Italy.
The old policy does not have a credible plan for the future, so he guides each individual
not to give up the privileges of small category with logical short-term. And the
Instead of the leadership which the country needs.
I present a summary of the priorities of the plan Civic Choice with Monti
Italy. We have a unique opportunity to make it happen. But this is only possible with
your support and your vote. It is the time of choice. Civic.

Mario Monti
