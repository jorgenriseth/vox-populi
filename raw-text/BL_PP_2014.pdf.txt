Citizens will have the opportunity to establish aclear choice on issues as varied as immigration, insecurity,the economy, the institutional future of the country, the European Union,the environment and mobility, as many topics about which the PartyPeople defend positions of common sense.THE  LEFT POPULAR  IT IS:  "THE COURAGE OF  THERE TRUTH &  THERE WILL ACTION  NOW" The traditional parties have been constantly leading us into an impasse.Belgium is in crisis: CRISIS ECONOMIC with poverty, which affectsincreasingly Belgian, Crisis IDENTITY following a Immigrationmassive CRISIS SOCIETAL by a complete reversal of our valuestraditional.THE  LEFT POPULAR WANTS  REVIVE  THERE DYNAMIC A COUNTRY  TO SHUTDOWN AND SE TURNS RESOLUTELY  TOWARD THE FUTURE  ALL  IN BUILDING AND  SURE OUR VALUES AND  SURE OUR IDENTITY     10  Our program, available in a hundred concrete proposals, includes aset of themes to give overall coherence to ourshare, but mostly sounds like a CALL  TO  THERE ENGAGEMENT GENERAL OF  CITIZENS !  HE Y  TO EMERGENCY  IF WE WANT AVOID  THERE CATASTROPHE !   TO RIGHTS  OF WHICH EACH CITIZEN  CAN SE RELY, WE Add  THE  HOMEWORK   Allowances which can benefit every individual struck by misfortuneof life, we add constraints, the obligation not to beload; the hospitality we give to immigrants, we recallduty of assimilation and respect for our lawsThese 100 proposals obviously does not solve all problemsa magic wand. However, they set a new coursebeneficial for Wallonia and Brussels. They intend to restore hopecitizens whose complaints continue to rise cope with achievementsdisappointing the traditional parties.11  IMMIGRATION Belgium has a tradition of being a haven. It must remain thefor those who imbibe values ​​and that are integrated within theactive population. It must also remain generous for realvictims of persecution around the world. It can also accommodate thosewho sincerely want to contribute to the common prosperity.HOWEVER,  THE MIGRANT MUST Adapt TO RULES  FROM COUNTRY HOST AND NO The REVERSE. If he does not complete the effort of assimilation, the feeswith suspicion. The figures are alarming today: 72% of Belgiansbelieve that immigration policy is a failure and 94% of ourcitizens believe that immigration is too important. They are right !The explanation lies in two facts: the excessive number of immigrantsentered legally and illegally in recent years and the refusalto accept our values ​​by a minority of these!THE MULTICULTURALISM  IS  A FAIL, as recognizedBesides leaders like Merkel or Cameron.Do not treat in depth the problems related to immigration is to riskof causing unacceptable rejection of all immigrants who have made the effortto integrate, share our values ​​and contribute to the prosperity of the country.Being lax face of Islamist claims of another age is to betray theconfidence of the thousands of men and women of Muslim origin whoaspire to blend in with our values ​​and demanding protection.Officially, there is no labor immigration of unskilled worksince 8 August 1974.
