Bolivia: Together we well for Living Well
2015-2020
After five hundred years of political, economic, social, cultural and exclusion among
a fierce neoliberal offensive since the mid-80s our resistance
were fusing the social struggle and political struggle under the horizon of building a
political instrument of liberation for the people, with which we faced the dire
consequences of imperialism, capitalism and colonialism in our country.
Thus, in the early 90s, the foundation materialize Instrument
Political of the people as the joint community and Party movement forms,
Returning to the strength of the historical memory of the native indigenous peoples,
of the working class and middle class social conscience.
Despite state repression then, with the unwavering popular will
We build our political instrument. Among the proscription typed from the embassy
US to our personality is not recognized by the National Court
Electoral and the energy expended by our people, we were born as Movement Toward
Socialism - Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples (MAS-IPSP). And among the
police repression and commitment to their bases, was born the leadership of our President
Evo Morales Ayma. For these reasons, our emergence in politics has its roots in the
imperialist, anti-colonial and anti-capitalist struggles of social movements.
Thus we opened a new history of indigenous political unity original
peasant, in the anti-neoliberal struggles of 2000-2005, was articulated with
workers and the middle classes, leading to the emergence of indigenous origin block
and popular peasant-worker.
Currently, MAS-IPSP has managed to radiate national and international level, its principles
political dignity, sovereignty and serve the people, becoming the instrument
more important in the political history of our country.
Since our first national voter turnout in 1997 when we got four
deputies, until 2002, when we stand as the second political force level
national; We never fail to combine the social struggle and political struggle. In December
2005, led by our leader Evo Morales políticaelectoral we achieved a historic victory with 54%, and in January 2006, we began to realize the revolutionary process
deep in our history.
Later, in 2008, the trust toward our president was ratified by the people
Bolivian in a referendum with 67% support, and in 2009, having approved our
new State Constitution, the Bolivian people elected with 64% of votes
our leader Evo Morales as the first constitutional president of the Plurinational State
from Bolivia.

1

Our political instrument, since its birth, has gone from victory to victory and this is
because it is an instrument of the people, it is an inclusive instrument, where we fit
each and everyone in the collective construction of Socialism for Community Living Well.
In the present Government Programme, as MAS-IPSP presented our proposal
government for the period 2015-2020, aimed at strengthening the rule
Multinational and deepening the process of change.
This proposal reflects the approach that the various social sectors conducted in
under the collective construction of the Patriotic Agenda 2025, made during the year
2013 through an extensive process of consultation with social and territorial level. Therefore the goals
we propose can be considered as intermediates with respect to
2025 established the agenda.
However, we can not talk about the future without mentioning the past. To consolidate
Democratic and Cultural Revolution is important to remember its founding principles. By
Therefore, prior to the development of the proposed 2015-2020, we detailed its central aspects, as well
as the elements that make the construction of the Plurinational State.
Our proposal is structured in 12 points:
1. All the eradication of extreme poverty
2. Basic Services for All
3. Together for a dignified life
4. Revolution and technological and scientific independence
5. For a productive, industrialized country with employment
6. By producing our food
7. Water for life and respect for Mother Earth
8. Integrating our Bolivia
9. Caring for our present to secure our future
10. Together for a sovereign country and safe
11. Revolution in justice with a congregation and transparency
12. All for a world order for life and humanity to Live Well
With our proposal, native indigenous peoples, workers, intellectuals,
students, businessmen patriots, women, men, children, youth, adults
seniors, all Bolivia will continue to advance together on the path of living well.
We invite everybody to be part of history and join the majority with which
we are building a different world. We have recovered our country now
It depends on all of us deepen our democratic and cultural revolution.

I.

The Bolivia left us

1. The long-term crisis in our history
The crisis of state in Bolivia, understood as a crisis of hegemony, was a result of
combination of a build-up of long and short term. Among the factors
Long-term highlight: the presence of a "state apparent" that regardless of their
liberal, neoliberal revolutionary or nationalist, was characterized by developing various
forms of exclusion of native indigenous peasant and worker masses. Also,
they defined this crisis the absence of the State throughout the national territory and
application of economic models aimed at foreign markets and to benefit
few. The first factor explains the scope of the coloniality of power, the second
the absence of state sovereignty and the third an economy for the benefit of capital
external. In short, a colonial capitalist social formation.
The colonial capitalist character of our training is directly related to the nature
the European invasion in our continent. The reason was greed for natural resources and
the exploitation of the labor of native peoples. The foundation
Republic in 1825 did not alter our greed for natural resources, together with various
forms of control of labor, characterized the entire Republican colonial period and
nor it modified the exclusion of native indigenous peoples.
Thus he continued the looting of our natural resources with an eye
complacent and complicit in the dominant social classes that held power during
Throughout this period, in which far from advancing towards overcoming our condition
primary export, our economy is subordinated to the interests of imperialist countries.

Except for rare moments of our history, like the nationalization of oil in 1937
and 1969, the prevailing logic was the plundering of our natural resources and
private, domestic and foreign appropriation of surplus.
The dramatic story of Bolivia has been marked by crises of various kinds, from Crisis
policies to social and economic crises of varying degrees. All crises of State,
except the last, they have been resolved from the perspective of the ruling classes.
So the crisis was called Federal war between liberals and conservatives,
crisis of the liberal state that confronted the remnants of the insurgent liberalism
revolutionary nationalism (1932-1952), the crisis of the nationalist state which faced a
exhausted nationalism with the emerging neoliberalism (1982-1985), and the state crisis
neoliberal (2000-2005). In all of them, except for the last crisis of state,
exploited and oppressed classes participated in some way, but only as
social force and not as a guiding force.
Any state crisis is a crisis that challenges the political,
economic and ideological and questions the power bloc. Its development is resolved
reconstituting the old regime based on new conditions or opening a
foundational process by which the sense of history is changed.
3

2. The crisis generated by the neoliberal State
Since 2000, Bolivia faced the deepest crisis since its foundation state,
but at the same time, a vigorous emergence of social classes and oppressed nations.
This crisis became the inauguration of a new era in 2006, with the
Boot the most profound revolution in our history by the type of state
Plurinational we are building for national-popular nature and community
the power bloc and the political project of communitarian socialism for Living
Well that is being carried out.
Despite the efforts of US imperialism and classes
Key to resolve the crisis by way of a reconfiguration of power relations
from strategic perspectives, our national popular and vigorous insurgency
Community was building a favorable level of relations and forces started
set an exit from the crisis in line with the interests of the people. For the first time in
our history classes and marginalized peoples we became protagonists in the
national and our own political instrument policy, the MAS-IPSP.
21.

Crisis of legitimacy, representativeness and authority

The last state crisis expressed very clearly the crisis of legitimacy,
representativeness and authority of the State and the crisis of the material foundation of
colonial capitalism. That is, its emergence and development not only condensed failure
capitalist neoliberalism as political, economic and cultural project, but also the
exhaustion of republican and colonial structures.
The crisis of representation and legitimacy that was seen in Bolivia, are explained by the
development of a political system with little social legitimacy that concentrated the
policy decisions in a minority group, used to be present in the exercise
the institutionalized power, either civil or military governments. Both crisis
They aggravated in the 1985-2005 period with the so-called "pacted democracy" whose
unpopularity in the population was growing rapidly. Democracy, even in its
liberal sense, was increasingly separated from the town once. The vote of the citizenry did not
importance because Congress chose one of the three leading candidates,
but none of them approached the barrier of 50 percent plus one. It's more,
It has the unpleasant experience of 1989, when the third on the list was elected president
by political parties of the time. In fact, these minorities ruled prioritizing
their interests above those of our country, making corruption and the cuoteo
preferred mechanism.
As a result of this, the state crisis also became the "crisis of authority".
The power bloc, except for some moments in history, more for lack of
alternative own right, never ceased to be increasingly dominant leader that day.
Hence resorted to methods of politically, social and cultural repression to silence our
social unrest before governments build social consensus.

2.2.

The crisis of the neoliberal model and the capitalist economic structure

Crises of State also implied a crisis the way it was organized
economy. And here, as has happened in the field of institutional structures,
breakdown of the neoliberal model condenses the failure of other models used
previously. We can say that the historical failure of three cycles expressed in 2000
economic: the cycle liberal, nationalist and neoliberal cycle cycle. The first was unable
to build an internal market and deepened the primary export economy and
importing a marked trend. The second showed a marked lack of efficiency
which it was combined with the constitution of a bureaucratic state bourgeoisie which benefited
SOEs and fed, under unfavorable conditions for the country, the sector
private. The third, dismantled the national productive apparatus, the privatized and transnationalized
surplus, it affected the purchasing power of wages and income, and we became a
highly import-dependent country.
Three instruments are emblematic of the application of the neoliberal model in Bolivia:
Supreme Decree No. 21060 of August 1985 and No. 22407 of January 1990, and
Capitalization Law No. 1544 of March 1994. The first was promulgated and developed
by President Victor Paz Estenssoro (MNR), the second by Jaime Paz Zamora (MIR) and
the third by Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada (MNR).
The three laws were adopted in the framework of a global policy
He expressed the interests of transnational corporations, imposed on countries like
ours through international organizations like the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and World Bank (WB), where US interference is evident.
In 1989, neoliberal globalization, which first turn to capitalism in
widespread, it led to the Washington Consensus, which was based on the
need to respond to the decline in the rate of profit of capitalism and its
appetite for higher profits through free trade, free capital mobility, the
development based on private initiative and the free market economy, in line
shrinking the state, which was nothing more than the loss of national sovereignty and
plunder of natural resources.
Neoliberalism, as the current phase of capitalist development, caused Dramatically
following effects in our country:
to)

The liberalization of the labor market. This gave the private entrepreneur
discretionary power to dismiss workers and determine whether or not there was
wage increases. This liberalization occurred even through forms
legalized by neoliberalism, as "relocation" of workers
miners. The average open urban unemployment during the period 19992005, rate exceeded 8%.

5

b)

The privatization of our companies and natural resources. This process is
He made in three stages: First, in 1985, under the pretext of decreasing
mineral prices on the world market began to more than 20,000
miners street workers, which led to the closure of mines or delivery
state to private capital. Second, privatization of companies in the
departmental corporations in the government of Paz Zamora; and third, in 1994,
with the sale of strategic dead chicken prices SOEs:
YPFB worth $ 836 million, an Italian company ENTEL by
$ 610 million, domain ENFE to the Chilean company Cruz Blanca 39
million, ENDE by 139.8 million dollars and 47 million LAB
dollars to a Brazilian company. It also highlights the granting of the three
main airports SABSA the company with an initial capital of 3,742
dollars.

c)

Privatization and outsourcing of the surplus. The objective of reducing the
State involvement in the economy was evidenced by the processes
privatization of public enterprises, closures and several other state banks
public institutions. Large state companies like YPFB and COMIBOL
others became mere managers of contracts and in some cases
simply waste.
This downsizing involved the transfer of economic surplus to the
transnational and some private entrepreneurs related to foreign capital.

d)

Increased poverty. In 2005, 10 people, six were in the
Poverty and 4 of those 10 were extremely poor, meaning
that poverty reached even a large sector of the middle class.
The neoliberal model revenue concentrated in a small group of the population
against an increasingly large number of people in urban and rural areas, which
They entered into the category of poverty. In the neoliberal governments they were executed
poverty reduction programs under the so-called "trickle-down theory," which
They failed miserably.

e)

Greater inequality. The unequal income distribution in the country deepened. From
Thus by 2005, Bolivia and Brazil were the countries with the worst distribution
income in the region. The Gini coefficient measures whether a country has a higher (value
close to one) or lower (close to zero) unequal distribution of
income for the Bolivian case in 2005 was 0.60.
Also in 2005 the income of the richest 10% of the population were 128 times
higher than the income of the poorest 10% of the population, something that
He showed the high concentration of wealth in few hands and the poor retention
the economic surplus in most of the population.

6

f)

The release rates and prices at the expense of purchasing power
wages and incomes.

g)

An investment law that protected the transnational capital, and that gave the
same benefits, or even better, than the domestic private capital, allowing
unrestricted remittance of profits abroad, under the laws of the free market.

h)

The productive disarticulation result of the abandonment of the state in making
policies aimed at promoting and developing the country's productive capacity. This
It caused a relocation of productive capital into the commercial sector and
importer.

i)

A weak domestic market. This resulted in a noticeable tilt
model to production for export and the contraction in demand
internal.

j)

The concentration of large tracts of land ownership in the
east and a worsening of smallholdings in the West. This led to inequality
between producers and agribusiness entrepreneurs. In both cases women
especially they were relegated.

k)

A lagging rural development. The free market policies of the neoliberal model and
food donations facilitated the consumption of agricultural products
imported and donated, which further discouraged agricultural production
national, leading to greater food dependency and worsening poverty
rural.

l)

A subordinate agencies and dependent economic policy
international. Bolivia to become the second laboratory in the neoliberal
region to implement neoliberal economic policies after
Chile, successive governments continued signed agreements with the IMF
(IMF) and World Bank (WB), importing recipes unresponsive
our economic and social reality.

m) fiscal imbalances. Despite the neoliberal tax reform, shrinking
State involvement in the economy, and lower public spending,
especially in wages and purchases of goods and services; fiscal results
were deficient, ie public sector expenditures always exceeded the
income-generating capacity. This neoliberal tax policy led to a deficit
end management in 2002 reaching 8.8% from the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP).
To finance these deficits, neoliberal governments, and loans contracted
They submitted to the conditionalities of multilateral organizations. During this period
external public debt reached on average 76% of GDP, reaching a maximum
99% in 1987.

7

n)

A reduction in public spending on health and education. This caused more
deficiency in both services and the proliferation of health centers and education
private they not necessarily improved quality standards, nor were
accessible to the population.
64% of the population were excluded from care in health centers
public and private. Education remained traits and conditions of inequality
access, retention and completion of studies, focusing its attention only on
basic education and leaving unattended other educational levels and modalities.
Your monocultural, colonial and capitalist relations of domination established character,
hegemony of Western knowledge, theft of identity, decoupling
between education and the production and concentration of wealth in one
segment of society, which triggered disconnect between education and
social needs.

o)

Dependence on external savings. The neoliberal doctrine was stated that Bolivia
unable to generate domestic savings so it was essential the presence of
foreign capital. However, the attraction of capital was a failure, because between
1985 and 2005 just joined an annual average of 307 million.

p)

Low effectiveness of monetary and exchange rate policy. The Bolivian economy
It dollarized during the two decades of neoliberalism. In 2000, product
Recession and economic and social instability generated by the model, saving and
Credit declined. The unstable context generated distrust in public
It led to deposit withdrawals that became in liquidity problems for
financial entities.
The Central Bank of Bolivia had no control over the amount of money
He is circulating in the economy, and the transactions are conducted mainly in
dollars. Therefore, monetary and exchange rate policies were ineffective for
help achieve macroeconomic objectives and limited only to devalue the
National currency.

q)

Low levels of investment in state enterprises. Examples of
low corporate reinvestment They performed for growth and improvement
technology, there may be mentioned:
ENTEL capitalized by an Italian company, never met investment
the committed amount of $ 610 million, as the capitalization agreement.
In addition, the capitalizing of the assets of the company was and failed their
tax obligations.
LAB also capitalized came to invest 47 million dollars offered, more
On the contrary, the company Capitalizadora transnacionalizaba the utilities
company to Ecuador and Brazil.
8

r)

Low growth of the economy. Between 1985 and 2005, the economy grew
average just 3.0%, the manufacturing sector grew 2.9% below,
while the hydrocarbon sector did little to 4.4%

3. The social and political emergence of the marginalized
The social outbreak that resulted in the Democratic and Cultural Revolution in 2006, is the
result of an accumulation of struggles of our peoples against the European invaders and
against exclusion experienced in the different cycles of the Republic in the hands of the
oligarchy.
But as noted, all state crisis may also lead to a time
foundation, and that's what happened in the last crisis. Unlike previous crises,
classes and marginalized people burst into the political scene and we took the
political initiative. The policy was brewing in assemblies, marches, strikes and lockouts
roads. The most important milestones of this uprising occurred in the period 2000-2005.
In 2000 we lived the "water war", in addition to the importance of having expelled
the US multinational, gave a powerful signal that it was possible to triumph over
neoliberalism. In September of that same year, the foundations of the old state again
crack with the rebellion of the Chapare coca growers preventing
installation of a US military base in Chimoré.
In 2003 he came "Black February" in the city of La Paz, where a break occurs in the
State apparatus (police and military showdown) and the intent of defeats
then government to impose taxes on people as the only way to generate
resources in a country that neoliberal governments had bankrupted.
Then came "Red October" with the "gas war" that moved us to the vast majority
of the population under the original indigenous peasant and worker leadership in defense of
our natural resources. The harsh repression deployed by the government, particularly
in the city of El Alto, far from reflecting its strength, he puts out your absolute fragility
before the vigorous popular emergency.
Of particular historical significance of the events of October 2003, because this powerful
democratic uprising of the majority historically neglected, beat Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada; emblematic figure of neoliberalism who was forced to resign and
leak to the United States; and that gives rise to the so-called "October Agenda", in which
the nationalization of hydrocarbons, Constituent Assembly arose,
industrialization, the most important points.
Then there is from May to June 2005, when in an attempt to leave his terminal stage,
all played by neoliberalism realize a conceived by the United States in its plan
Embassy in La Paz, to put Senator Hormando Vaca Diez as president
our country after the resignation of Vice President Carlos Mesa. At that time, a
9

Siege of peasants and miners cooperative deals a devastating blow to plans
of the ruling class and the empire.
From the economic-corporate struggles at first, until the unified mobilizations
then the question of the seizure of power by social movements started
gain greater importance. We started to leave the isolated struggles, protests and
protest to move to the political struggle. The influence of this initiative, was forming
an indigenous peasant and popular original block with ability to radiate its principles
dignity and sovereignty of other sectors of Bolivian society. That is, we begin to
become a benchmark state steering effect until our mobilization
proposal and topped with the conquest of political power in the 2005 general election.
The resounding victory of the Movement Towards Socialism - Political Instrument for the
Sovereignty of the Peoples (MAS-IPSP), led by our leader, Evo Morales, in
December 2005 marks several milestones: first, the breakdown of democracy of minorities,
because our candidate native peasant indigenous origin, reached 54% of the
voting; second, the beginning of the resolution of the state crisis from the perspective of others
the former ruling classes; and third, the starting point of the Democratic Revolution
Cultural toward Socialism for Community Living Well.

II.

Bolivia today

1. Democratic and Cultural Revolution
With the Democratic and Cultural Revolution, since 2006, we have launched a
process of change in Bolivia, no return. It never is able to govern the country apart
of the majority and the popular will. We speak of a revolution, because we are
radically changing the old colonial-republican structures economically,
social, political and cultural.
Our revolution is democratic because the victory of our political instrument has been
through the ballot box, and that our strategic objective is the consolidation of a
expanded democracy, deliberation and permanent exercise of power as an instrument
people's liberation. It is also because in the democratic framework of pluralism
political, without denying representative democracy, direct democracy also exercise and
Community.
Our revolution is cultural, because we are breaking with the colonial heritage,
recognizing, promoting and integrating indigenous knowledge of native peoples
peasants in the construction of the new Multinational State. In this sense,
We promote intercultural dialogue and drive a thorough process of decolonization
political, economic, social and cultural.

2. We met with the People's Will: Nationalization and Assembly
Constituent
21.

Nationalization

On 1 May 2006 we nationalize our oil, fulfilling one of the
Popular mandates of the October Agenda, starting recovery

our strategic natural resources.
The nationalization was addressed under the premise established by our President Evo
Morales "We want partners, not bosses." So, we started building a new
history in our country, a story of dignity, sovereignty, and economic policy
no drives away foreign investment, but it makes sure that the Bolivian people the
you receive the greatest benefits.
The nationalization of hydrocarbons, mining, electricity, telecommunications, and others;
it has allowed the state to appropriate the resources that were brought before transnational
and be earmarked for building a productive economy and industrialized base.
Also, thanks to the recovery of our natural resources, we can now apply
an effective social policy aimed at eradicating poverty and reducing
economic and social inequalities.

constituent Assembly

One of the most important mandates of Agenda October 2003, expressed as
The proposed Plan of Government in our MAS-IPSP 2005 was the convening of a
Constituent Assembly to transform from foundation, the colonial state
Republican.
This desire was reflected on August 6, 2006, when the Assembly was installed
Constituent to generate a new sense, with the historical participation
representatives of various social sectors.
The Constituent Assembly was a profoundly democratic peoples strategy
campesino and indigenous people's movements, to generate a frame
consensus within a new state, but it was also the way to concretize aspiration
historically marginalized majorities of the country. The Assembly was the result of Power
Synthesizing constituent projects, proposals, resistance and struggle
centuries of the Bolivian people.
In addition to the law, the Constitution of the State (CPE) arising from the
Assembly enjoys the legitimacy it lacked the previous and subsequent amendments
undertaken outside the majority. The referendum of January 25, 2009 determined
clearly that the people supported the new Constitution and 7 February of the same year,
President Evo Morales promulgated our new Constitution.
"After 500 years of rebellion, invasion and ongoing looting; after
180 years of resistance against a colonial state, after 20 years of struggle
standing against a neoliberal model, today February 7, 2009, is a
historical event, an unprecedented, unique event for Bolivia and
Latin America; gathered here to promulgate the new constitution
State "(Address of the President of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Evo Morales
Ayma, El Alto, February 7, 2009).
2. 3.

Plurinational State

If anything confirms that Bolivia is developing a revolutionary process is
the transition from a colonial capitalist state to a plurinational state socialist
Community and autonomy for Living Well.
From the realm of the political state we live in a process of structural change state
in its different dimensions: the power bloc, belief systems, correlation
forces, institutional system and type of state. These changes have not been registered at the same
time and with the same speed; but have the common feature that are overtaking the
old pages that were sealed by colonialism of power, political dependence
and economic discrimination, racism and exclusion.
14

With the construction of the Plurinational State of the adoption of the new Constitution, will
running past the apparent state that, unlike other modern states,
our country was not able to present itself as the expression of the will of everyone,
establish sovereignty throughout the country, to ensure legal equality and
Policy everyone, or to incorporate other ways of thinking and organizing the world,
if the indigenous peoples of highland and lowland.
Unlike what happened in the Republican period, which usually was appropriate
by a small group of people linked to interests of transnational capital; today
Bolivians, are making structural changes in the state, which is
evident in the following aspects:


First, there is a pluri-popular leadership, which synthesizes
creative potential of the time. Here we are as social organizations,
with our political and economic practices. That core is present
materially in small rural and urban producers and politically in
organizations were able to fuse into a single social struggles,
political, protest and strategic for power.
That leadership, unlike those who preceded him in the management of the State and the
organization of society, is not exclusive, and what you are doing is to
up building a homeland for all and all Bolivians.



Second, the new leadership in power is radiating, with the plurality
worldviews and ways of seeing the world, to the whole new order
state and societal-community we are building. Societalcomunitario say that the Bolivian social formation has both characteristics;
we have ways of thinking and living individual, but we also have forms
thinking and living community.



Third, in addition to the displacement of the old power, we begin to change
the old system of stately colonial beliefs and other social and community, this
Democratic way and Cultural Revolution has given way to a new relationship
power between the state and society.



Fourth, we are building a real articulation of the territory. The
decentralization and regional autonomy, departmental, municipal and indigenous
peasant originally established in our CPE, strengthen the unity of the State
Multinational and allow first a territorial management according to our
social and cultural characteristics.



Fifth, we proceeded to the change in the type of institutions we
He accompanied since the founding of the Republic. We can say, in fact, that our
fifteen

revolutionary government promoted profound changes in two parts: the old
State in the period January 2006- January 2009 and the new state order
construction since February 2009 to date. Amid old
institutions, we urge nationalization, a new economic model and a
policy of redistribution of wealth.
The new state institutions based on the recognition of the multinational character
Bolivian social formation. The Constitution states that our country is founded on pluralism and
political, economic, legal, cultural and linguistic pluralism, within the integrative process
the country, in addition to chart our civilizational horizon of Living Well, which poses the
great challenge to rebuild a harmonious relationship between human beings and Mother Earth.
The Plurinational State is under construction. Do not forget that there are two tasks
They are making parallel the circumstances in which it is carried out the revolution:
on the one hand, remove the practice gear and procedures that accompanied the
old state and the other, build and realize the new Plurinational State.

2.4.

Extension of democracy

Democracy in the Plurinational State is not a speech that was built
apparent realities; it is a philosophy, policy and practice inherent to the full
social, individual and community, participation in shaping a new relationship between
the state and society.
We are building a democracy in which the people did not just vote and choose, but
participate and decide. There is an expansion of democracy and thus a real participation
the people without which no revolution can succeed.
While representative democracy is maintained, which periodically we turn to
urns, we made a big change in terms of credibility and legitimacy. We can now
say that people vote and choose, unlike what happened in the past with the
pacted democracy of megacoaliciones.
But that's not all, the liberal conception of democracy to reduce single selection
authorities by universal suffrage, has joined other ways of thinking, living
and practice democracy. We are talking about democracy and community
participatory-direct, vigorous democracy fully in the period of resistance
neoliberalism 2000-2005, and now established in the State Constitution. Is
Moreover, the other two democracies that we incorporate into the Constitution were key
defend the process of the dangers that lay in wait in the terminal phase of the old state
(2006-2009) and to display the creative energy in the early years of State
Plurinational.
With these two democracies, by the representative we progressively setting
an enlarged and intercultural democracy. So it is no accident that our president Evo
16

Morales has said, inaugurating the First Plurinational Meeting in December 2011, which
I felt that broad discussion of social organizations and movements was a
assembly of the people, and neither is an improvisation of call for all sectors
collective social construction of a Patriotic Agenda 2025.
From the point of view of how to participate in the new political system, it is important
noting that the political party form, have joined the movement hard way
social and community form. Behind it is becoming a tradition that a small group
attributed the representativeness of everyone. The people now speak, participate, deliberate and
He decides.
The expansion of democracy in Bolivia moves over formal equality and freedom to
Step effective equality and freedom with full social participation. With democracy
we are building intercultural and there is no legal rights to equality,
but a political and legal equality in the realization of rights. It is a
democracy that each passing day creates conditions to ensure equal
rights and opportunities for all. We are talking about a comprehensive democracy in
that politics is not separate from the economic, the social, the cultural, or the
principles and traditional values ​​assumed by the Multinational State.
2.5.

Community Social Productive Economic ModelNo revolution that does not change the social composition in the state from establishing a
new balance of power and, therefore, does not resolve the ownership of power. That
It has been more than demonstrated by the hard facts of the past eight years.
But there is also a revolution that does not change the material conditions on which
it will settle and the new state and societal / community order be played.
When we were fighting against neoliberal policies, and we identified and denounced
the structural crisis being experienced by capitalism expressed in various crises, which today
They converge and feed: climate, food, energy, water, finance,
macroeconomic and institutional policies, among others.
At this time of global turmoil, our country shows historical results
economic and social, recognized nationally and internationally. This is because
Since 2006, the Bolivian people work together in building a new
State and a new economic model oriented replace neoliberalism and its
dire consequences.
The Community Social Productive Economic Model, is a model of transition to
Community Living Well socialism, made by Bolivian and Bolivians, of
so committed to our reality, and taking into account the crisis in the
world capitalism.

17

The new economic model, because it promotes social policies and distribution
redistribution of wealth and economic surplus, establishing as part of their
main purposes, the eradication of poverty in its many dimensions and
reducing economic and social inequalities.
It is communal, because it seeks to complement the individual and the collective on the horizon
Living Well, articulating different forms of economic organization on principles
Indian native of reciprocity, complementarity, solidarity, redistribution,
equality, sustainability, balance, fairness, transparency and respect for Mother Earth.
It is productive, because it promotes the expansion and diversification of the productive matrix,
In order to overcome the primary export model and achieve a production economy,
promoting the industrialization of our natural resources in an articulated manner
harmony with Mother Earth, and helping to strengthen our sovereignty
economic.

2.5.1. Foundations of our economic model


Growth and development based on the exploitation of natural resources
for the benefit of Bolivians
Sovereignty in the definition of economic policy. Nationalization of the sectors
strategic, production, processing and generating greater surplus
economic. Antithesis of the theory of the "curse of natural resources.



Appropriation of the economic surplus
The state appropriates economic surplus generated by sectors
strategic. The state directs the economy and regulates the production process,
distribution and marketing of goods and services.



Redistribution of surplus and income
The economic surplus is redistributed especially among people
poor, through transfer (Juancito Pinto, Juana Bono
Azurduy and Dignity Pension), public investment, wage increases inversely
proportional, cross-subsidization, and others.



Eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities
The social implications of the economic model are aimed at eliminating exclusion
social, reducing asymmetries, generating opportunities and greater equality.
18

2.5.2. Functioning of our Economic Model
We identified two groups of sectors in our economy: strategic sectors,
generating economic surplus (hydrocarbons, mining, electricity,
telecommunications and environmental resources); and income-generating sectors
employment (manufacturing and handicrafts, tourism, agricultural development, housing,
trade, transportation and others).
The state appropriates surplus strategic sectors, and transfers to
sectors that generate income and employment, promoting the industrialization of
renewable and non-renewable natural resources; but in turn, the state uses part of those
surplus in social policies and redistribution of income and reinvest elsewhere in
the same sectors generating surpluses. Thus, we generated
sustained economic growth, accompanied by the reduction of poverty and inequality.

2.5.3. State's role in our economic model
In neoliberalism, the state was reduced to a minimum, limiting its role in
the economy to promote free competition and transferring its essential functions
to the market; situation that became a deepening of economic inequalities and
social in our country.

19

When we came into government, we started to strengthen our state, and upon approval of
new State Constitution, the people gave extensive capabilities in the economy.
Today, we have a strong state directs the economy and their planning processes.
Also, it exercises direction and control of strategic sectors and participate
directly into the economy by encouraging and production of goods and services
economic and social.
Furthermore, the application of Community Social Productive Economic Model, the
State articulates the plural economy, promoting the integration of different forms
economic production (state, community, social, cooperative and private), under the
Socialism Community economic horizon that articulates the individual interest with the
Living Well group.

2.5.4. Economic stability and social equity
During the neoliberal, macroeconomic stability was an end in itself, so
So it was outside of social reality.
Currently, our economic model takes care of stability, but as social equity,
understanding that when there is economic crisis, it always affects the poor.
Economic stability is also important for our government, as it becomes
the base from which we deepen the political and social changes.

2.5.5. Recovery of sovereignty of macroeconomic policies

From 2006, we recovered sovereignty in defining our policy
economic, before subordinated to international organizations like the IMF
(IMF).
Since our first year in office, we developed the Fiscal-Financial Program
each managing a sovereign manner. Furthermore, we build a fiscal policy oriented
growth with redistribution, production, industrialization, food sovereignty and
employment generation.
With bolivianización of our economy, the ability to recover politics
monetary, that during neoliberalism was kidnapped by high dollarization
they generated.
Similarly, transform the financial system, so that it accompanies the
social and productive policy established by our government.

20

2.5.6. Revitalization of domestic demand
During neoliberalism under the famous phrase "Export or die", the rulers of that
period focused all their attention on exports, leaving the domestic market,
generating a high dependence on foreign markets and getting our economy more
vulnerable to imbalances in the international context.
From 2006, with the implementation of social policies and redistribution
income, together with high levels of public investment, boost demand have achieved
internal and today it becomes the main engine of our growth.

2.5.7. Our economic model has dismantled myths:


That the state is a bad manager. Today is in force in our country a Performer
Productive Social Economic Community is rewriting history
economic of the country at the head of state and responsible stewardship of its
public enterprises.



That revolution is synonymous with backwardness. Since 2006, Bolivia has taken steps
giant in improving the quality of life of the population through provision
basic services, infrastructure, technological development and repositioning and
leadership of the country internationally.



That the revolution does not respect private property. The Constitution
State recognizes and respects all forms of economic organization.

3. Socialism for Community Living Well
We are making progress in building the Community Socialism, as a process of
uninterrupted revolution which should strengthen the well being of the Bolivian population. He
Community socialism is a synthesis of the political aspirations of the working class to
the construction of socialism, and of nations and native indigenous peoples
towards an enhancement of communal forms of production and reproduction of life
Community Socialism is a society with fewer classes
antagonistic without the anarchy of the market and capital is an enlarged community
Twinning between peoples. Our fight aims to end the
exploitation, eradicate material, social and spiritual poverty, training women and
new man, encourage the creation of individual, community and state wealth release
productive forces of the community. The ultimate goal is not the accumulation of wealth by
but few generate wealth for redistribution, ensuring
playback systems life of Mother Earth.

21

The main features of our struggle for socialism for Community Living
Well, that recovers the social project of the working class and the native indigenous project
peasant, they are:
It is socialist, because it is based on the generalization of democratic processes in
all areas (political, economic, social and cultural) based on shares
decolonization, intercultural and territorial autonomy, to achieve a society that has
eradicated material, social and spiritual poverty and all forms of social oppression, as well as
the satisfaction of basic needs and fundamental rights for all
all Bolivians. It is a society which is based on production and redistribution
wealth without the alienation of labor, preserving and ensuring public goods
common heritage of environmental functions for the Bolivian people through non-
commodification of nature.
It is communal, because it promotes liberation and strengthening of political forces,
social and productive community, as the foundation of the society in which
There is a common scenario of complementarity between individual rights,
collective and Mother Earth. Here, the community building is one of the
main stages of development of the individual and consolidated her ideals
revolutionaries of the common good.
Community Living Well Socialism to be then the result of two perspectives
fundamental historical: the peasant indigenous worldview, upland and
lowlands, which is the essence of living well as alternative philosophy and civilization; Y
socialism as a form of organization of social life radically different
society and the economic, political, cultural, ideological and power relations
constructed and reproduced by capital.
Socialism for Community Living Well has the following characteristics:


Anticolonial. There is no chance of overcoming capitalism and its logic
perverse domination by the denial and overcoming the coloniality of power,
of knowing, being and doing. This involves destroying the material foundations and
Subjective on racism, internal colonialism and new sits
external forms of colonialism. Decolonization involves dismantling the foundations
institutional, economic, political and cultural of the old state and build new
foundations for a new way of organizing social life.



Anticapitalist. Our fight is not only against the neoliberal model. Our struggle
is against capitalism and all forms of manifest itself in certain
historical moments. Capitalism favors the production and reproduction of
capital before production and reproduction of life; why is a system
death, because it destroys human beings and nature, and also
appropriates all that work and produce everything that Mother Earth gives us.
22



Imperialist. You can not be truly anti-colonial and anti-capitalist if the
while it is not consistently anti-imperialist. Reaching our
our economic sovereignty and political independence is to assume our struggle
against imperialism. Otherwise, you can not be advanced towards Socialism
For Community Living Well if it is not universally destroys capital and
higher form of political organization: imperialism.

4. Living Well: Our civilization horizon alternative to capitalism
Our Democratic and Cultural Revolution, is civilizing horizon Living Well,
alternative to the many forms of alienation of the historical development of capitalism
condemns human beings and Mother Earth.
It is a philosophy of life based on the ethical foundation which claims culture
the fullness of life, as opposed to the culture of capitalist death; recovering
deepest roots of our history and our cultures highlands and lowlands,
Prior to the colonial invasion and gaining strength at a time when capitalism is
placing humanity and nature to the brink of extinction.
We speak of Living Well, because we do not intend to live better. We want everyone
we can live well, we want to achieve harmonious relations among all. The live better accepted
that some may be better than others; and that is not living well. No work is not living
But lying is not living well, submit your neighbor is not living well, exploit neighbor is not
live good. Threatening nature possibly allow us to live better, but that does us
He takes to live well; what we seek is a harmonic life of man and the
Mother Earth.
Living Well, as civilizing horizon established in the Plurinational State,
It implies recognition of:


The full force of the world view of nations and native indigenous peoples
farmers who radiates strength of the community in all areas of
production and reproduction of life under the reconstitution of harmony
and our human relationship with Mother Earth.



Its articulation with socialism as an emancipatory horizon of workers and
broad sectors of society working under the premise that "another world is
possible "without the exploitation of man by man.
Hence, unlike capitalism offers us there is only one route (the
uniqueness) to conquer the "myth of development" and that there is only one way
organization of social life (capitalism), since, as Plurinational State
condensation of the history of exploits and heroic deeds of our tricolor and
intercultural character of our Wiphala-, we carry Socialism
Community for Living Well.
2. 3

Living Well has five major dimensions that can not be understood in
independently:


The dimension of values ​​and principles. We are talking about values
complementarity, reciprocity, harmony and balance, but also of being, living,
do and feel.
In the ethical and moral principles we are talking about love qhilla llulla loves, loves
suwa (do not be lazy, do not lie, do not steal) and also to send
obeying.



The size of the balance. This means a harmonious link between the
individual fulfillment and the (ancient or modern) community but also
in the harmony between human beings and other life forms. In short, a
balance "with oneself, with others and with nature."



Civilizational dimension. It translates into the construction of a plurinational state,
decolonized and sovereign socialism based on the Community for Living Well
it is assumed as an alternative to capitalism horizon.



Political dimension. Means leaving behind not only the "state apparent" but also the
"Restricted status" to make way for a "comprehensive state" in which the values ​​and
principles are as prevalent in the organization and enjoyment of social life and
the commons. It is the full force of the "intercultural democracy" in which
citizens and peoples vote, choose to participate and decide. It is also moving from
formal recognition of the principle of equal rights before the materialization
rights.



Geopolitical dimension. It is a philosophy of life and an alternative project to
capitalism with full universal value to boost the "diplomacy of peoples
life "and building a" new world order to Live Well ".

24

III. We want the Bolivia 2015-2020:
12 proposals for Living Well
Our government program "Bolivia: Together we well for Living Well" aims
consolidate achievements in eight years in office, and further progress in
political, economic, social, cultural, scientific and technological liberation of the Bolivian people
by 2020.
Fundamentally, our proposals are aimed at further narrowing asymmetries
economic and social family to family, community to community, from city to city,
from department to department, and even from continent to continent; and to this was
oriented productive and social programs that we are presenting.
The tasks of poverty eradication and consolidation of an economy
and industrialized production are not only a responsibility of the National Government
but at all levels and institutions of the Plurinational State; part of the program
present, it involves the joint participation of the national government and all
subnational governments.
Our proposal, structured in 12 points, aims not only to overcome material poverty
to which we condemned capitalism, but also to overcome social and spiritual poverty
I imposed on us by colonialism, moving towards building a new order
World to Live Well.
Economic foundations of Government Program
The foundations of the Government Program for the period 2015-2020 are growth
maintaining sustained economic stability and continuing the economic policies
redistributive income (mainly Bonds and Income), proven and economic policies
successful for the Bolivian economy in the period 2006-2014.
The growth of the past eight years has averaged 5% a year, which allowed
increasing employment for Bolivians, greater opportunities and improvements in
income and quality of life for all Bolivians. For the period 20152020, with the implementation of this government program, the country will grow at a rate
annual average of 7.1%, reaching a historical relationship 2020 Investment / GDP of 27%
higher than the period 2006-2014 and much higher than the inheritance model indicators
neoliberal (1985-2005) when the Bolivian economy grew an average of only 3%
record investment / GDP ratio of 15%. This new growth with the
deepening redistributive income policies among Bolivians, it will be reflected in
major sources of decent jobs, especially for young people entering the
labor market, higher incomes and opportunities, continuous improvement in the quality of
lives of Bolivians, significant reduction of moderate and extreme poverty,
wage increases that will increase the purchasing power of employees and
strengthening the industrialization process in Bolivia.
25

All this in a framework of economic stability guaranteed as already did in the
period 2006-2014, especially with regard to the stability of prices
Main products of the family basket, reflected in a variation of the index
consumer prices in the period 2015-2020 will have an average annual rate of
5.7% lower than that observed during the period 2006-2014 and of course much less than
the Bolivians endure during the neoliberal period.
1. All the eradication of extreme poverty
The great challenge for our country is to build a more equitable society
take their natural resources for men and women who inhabit
live in dignity without discrimination and harmoniously.
To this end, the Plurinational State establishes its open willingness to overcome exclusion
and substantially reduce economic inequalities and inequities, social, cultural
and policies within the framework of the new national vision, so focused to intervene
progressive in the territories and vulnerable populations and extreme poverty, in order to achieve
in the short, medium and long term, structural changes in the living conditions of
the population.
In that sense, the first task is our proposal addresses inroads into
the eradication of extreme poverty.
In 2005, when we received the country, extreme poverty was 38%, almost 4
10 people lived in extreme poverty. During our governance
(2006 - 2013), extreme poverty fell to 18%, which means that the number of poor
ends decreased approximately 4 million people in 2005 to 2 million
people in 2013.
Despite these advances, we will not rest until free the country from this condition.
Our proposal to the Bolivian people is to reduce extreme poverty by the year 2020 to 9% by
line with the target set in Agenda 2025. A territorial level, this will entail at least
we will have eradicated extreme poverty in 100 municipalities, through programs
integral comprising the provision of water, sanitation,
electricity, education, health, housing conditions, and productive strengthening.

In 2006 we received back the country with 60% of the population living in moderate poverty,
which means that six out of 10 people did not have enough income to purchase
major consumer goods and other basic services. By 2013, we have reduced this
percentage to 38.4%; it is estimated that moderate poverty declined from 5.9 million
in 2006 to 4.2 million people in 2013. Our proposal is to reduce the
26% of the population in moderate poverty by 2020.
Achieving these goals will take place with the full implementation of all proposals
It raises our government program, so that we can tackle poverty
from a multidimensional perspective:





Improve incomes.
Reduce levels of unsatisfied basic needs.
Reduce social poverty.
Reduce spiritual poverty.

Goals for 2020:

2. Basic Services for All
Inequality and lack of access to basic services, are the structural expression
the denial of the rights of individuals. To address this situation, meeting
established by the CPE and the proposal of Bolivia to the United Nations, our
Government Program raises universal access to basic services.
21.

Water and Sewer

From the 90s, an approach of "modernization", which involved extended
intervention of private capital in the provision of services, knowing well the
social and public heritage. The characteristic of this intervention caused
mobilizations and conflicts, emphasizing the "Water War" in Cochabamba in 2000.
However, this situation is reversed with the arrival to the government of MAS-IPSP, which
through the CPE defines access as a human right to water. In this framework,
2006-2014 period consolidated 1.9 million water connections. As
result of this effort, the country managed to meet and exceed the target advance
Millennium Development reaching 81% coverage.
As it relates to basic sanitation, for the same period we further
996 thousand new sewage connections. The results show that a
53.5% (59.6% urban and 40.9% rural) population already has this service.
2020 management, our proposal is to reach 100% coverage of drinking water
urban area and 90% coverage in rural areas; and 80% sewerage coverage
health in urban areas and 70% sewerage coverage in the area
rural.
To fulfill these goals a substantial element is the coordination between the
central and subnational levels, both in the financing and management
these services.

Goals for 2020:



100% drinking water coverage in urban areas and 90% coverage area
rural.
80% sewerage in urban areas and 70% in rural areas sewerage

Electricity

The reforms in the power sector in the failed neoliberal stage effects
significant growth in electrical infrastructure or quality of supply,
especially in peri-urban and rural areas, or coverage in the urban area
Bolivia in 2005 was 87%, while in rural areas only reached 33%.
With this background, our government worked hard on expanding the
coverage throughout the country. In the period 2006-2012, coverage nationwide
increased by 15%, from 67% (1.5 million households) in 2005 to 82% (2.3
million households) by 2012, with more emphasis on rural areas of the country, leaving the
challenge of moving much more dynamic way to achieve universal.
Our Programme for Government proposes to increase the coverage and urban electrification
Cottage promote universal electricity service as a right
fundamental Bolivians. We plan to run in the period 2015-2020
"Lighter Zero" program, to achieve a national coverage of 97%, providing
electric service to 968,000 new homes. In urban areas will be achieved the
incorporating universal service to 582,000 households in rural areas and one
coverage of 90% including 386 thousand households. They will join the service
Electric 1,715 health centers and education.
To this end, projects will be implemented with different technologies: network extension
electrical, network densification and implementation of alternative energy (solar,
hydropower, wind, biomass), with emphasis on places away from rural areas.

Goals for 2020:




Full coverage of 97% providing electric service to 968,000 new homes.
or 100% urban area
or 90% rural area
Integrating the electricity to 1,715 health centers and education.

Gas Natural Household

Since we are government, we saw the need to take control of one source
generating major surpluses, whereby the May 1, 2006
nationalize the hydrocarbons recovered the ownership, possession and total control of the
refundamos hydrocarbons and YPFB to operate throughout the hydrocarbon chain name
Been. In that vein, one of the policy priorities of hydrocarbons has been the
gas supply Bolivian families.

29

In 2005, the gas supply to the Bolivian families reached to 44 thousand connections.
During our management policy meeting for Bolivian gas, put YPFB
triggered an intensive expansion plan of the distribution system for natural gas
networks, which has led to 398 000 domestic facilities in the country; these facilities
not only benefit families but also production units among industries,
shops and services now have gas.
Our commitment to the Bolivian population is permanent. Network installations
home gas expands day by day across the country, so this service
It will remain a priority. By 2020, we will reach more than one million families,
thus reaching 60% coverage.
In the case of cities and towns that are not connected to the central system
products, from 2015 the supply of natural gas is made through the program
Virtual gas, which gas is to transport liquid in tanks populations far from
pipelines, which otherwise would not have access to natural gas.

Goals for 2020:



More than one million natural gas facilities house
Coverage of 60% of the Bolivian population

2.4.

Telecommunications

From the force of the CPE all people are entitled to universal access and
equitable access to telecommunications is a state responsibility and the provision of this
service. Telecommunications, information technology and communication are
important to the social, cultural and political development of peoples vehicles. his
expansion contributes significantly to improving the quality of life of people.
In the neoliberal period, transnational companies provided service with a focus
mercantilist, reaching the same only where it was profitable, leaving a part
important of the Bolivian population outside the system of signal transmission
cell phone, Internet and even radio and television. This reality was more problematic
in border areas, where the population is informed through media
Communication from neighboring countries in the absence of national service.
Since 2006, the state assumes a leading role again in order to give
solutions to the deficiencies referred essentially to unequal access to
telecommunications services and the loss of surplus state in the sector
caused by the privatization of ENTEL. At this stage the following is reached
Accomplishments:

Mobile telephony has grown steadily since 2006. At the beginning of our management
government in Bolivia had 2.4 million mobile lines, which increased to 10.7 million
May 2014.
The internet access service in 2005 was insignificant 0.76%. In 2013 he came to
34%, or about 3.5 million users. Only between 2012 and 2013, the service
Internet access grew from 1.9 million to 3.5 million connections connections.
In May 2014, 100% of municipal capitals have phone coverage
mobile internet and mobile broadband.
Our government proposal is to continue on this path of service expansion. He

Together for a dignified life

The dignity of a society is measured through access to health, education,
housing and other basic living conditions that enable the reduction of
social asymmetries.
3.1.

Bless you

In the neoliberal stage, the State abandoned its social obligations and let the free market
the health care system, resulting in a high degree of social exclusion and
abandonment of the public health system, causing a serious deterioration of care in
especially in hospitals. The right to health could only have it who could
pay for it.
Since taking our brother President, the right to health has been
ongoing concern, conceiving health as a right and a right that must
be available to the entire population. In that line the main advances are reflected in:






there will be the gradual implementation of Mi Salud in all municipalities,
32

ensuring care throughout the territory; the big challenge is to get Universal Insurance
Health (MI SUS) 70% of the population.
To do this, in order to close the gap in infrastructure needs and care
We propose:
-

Fourth Level 4 hospitals in the following specialties: Oncology,
Cardiology and Nephrology Bronchopulmonary in Cochabamba, Tarija, La Paz and Santa
Cruz, respectively.
At least one tertiary hospital in each departmental capital and four in
intermediate cities.

Education

For decades, the Bolivian education remained traits and conditions of inequality
access, retention and completion of the humanities cycle, focusing its attention only
basic education and leaving unattended other educational levels and modalities.
Its ape culture, colonial and capitalist character established relations of domination, hegemony
Western knowledge, theft of identity, disconnect between education and
production and concentration of wealth in one segment of society, a fact that
generated disconnect between education and the needs of society.
Our government in the process of educational revolution begins, which aims to
break the cycle of exclusion rote education, colonial, patriarchal.
The Educational Revolution contains all the aspirations of the indigenous movements,
social movements, social organizations, teachers and parents
seeking the challenge of ensuring and generating the political, economic and social transformation

living place

One of the important variables in the overall development and quality of life
people is housing, access to basic services, considered by the
State Constitution as fundamental rights.
The housing deficit reflects the current status of tenure and the quality of housing,
it has accumulated each year in the neoliberal period, the lack of public policies
intervention, timely and appropriate, to meet the real needs of the population
and reduce the growth rates of the components of this deficit. This situation
begins steadily to be settled from rethinking the framework of the
social policies with structural changes to meet basic needs.
Thus, in the framework of the Democratic and Cultural Revolution, from 2006 we defined
policies of access to land and access to housing, health risks and participatory management;
create programs for the provision of state housing throughout the national territory,
mainly in rural areas, we prioritize the poorest sectors
population.
Since 2006 were built, they improved and extended a total of 72,125 housing units at an
Bs3.803 million investment, of which 11,524 in the urban area (16%) and 60 601 in the
rural areas (84%). Of the total, 61 811 homes were executed in the form of subsidy
(86%) and 10,314 in the form of credit (14%). Furthermore, the provision was institutionalized
housing for those affected by the natural disasters that had lost their homes.
38

State assistance in the housing sector has benefited about 300,000 people around
the territory of the Plurinational State of Bolivia.
Moreover, under the new Financial Services Act, from the first
half of 2014 domestic banks granted loans for housing
social worth $ us92,5 million, benefiting 2616 families without number
refinanced loans at advantageous conditions for the population.
Continuing and deepening the policy of providing housing to the population
Bolivian in quantity, quality and respecting the productive land, we propose the
following actions for the period 2015-2020:
3.3.1

Legal security for housing.

We will continue with the task of cleaning up the property rights of housing through
administrative and judicial processes, ensuring legal certainty.
3.3.2. State provision of housing
We will promote social and economic policies for all Bolivians with
to recover the family as the basic unit of community life; in this sense,
housing projects will accompany the process of economic development, so
that housing will have flexible functional features to constitute a
stability instrument and family economic security; in this sense we develop
new housing solutions.


State provision of single-family homes

We continue the construction of single-family, urban and rural housing under
forms of subsidies, credit or mixed (grant and loan). We build for
progressive housing young families, housing support the income of
families and contribute to tourism development in the state.
In the period 2015-2020, a total of 40,300 single-family homes will be built
provision of basic services:
or
or

28,300 houses in urban area
12,000 homes in rural area



State provision of multifamily housing

The lack of policies to control the growth of urban areas has caused the
urban development only encourage real estate speculation, causing the population
lower income is marginalized from access to housing in buildings
multifamily.

39

Under a policy of community housing, we build and renew massively
multifamily buildings, housing estates with basic services, equipment,
accessibility and public services, allowing to obtain fair market values
facilitate access to the Bolivian population, promoting solidarity and social equity.
Housing densification find a policy that gives priority to the contributors,
building a total of 43,000 apartments in multifamily buildings.
3.3.3.

Improved housing Improved Life

We refund the living conditions of those shacks
built in urban and rural areas, improvement projects, expansion and renovation
homes across the country. The form of intervention in urban areas will be
through the form of credit and rural areas in the form of subsidy, contribution
labor and municipal governments counterparts and departmental governments.
It is set to target a total of 125,000 improved housing, expanded and renovated
(37,500 houses in urban area, 87,500 homes in rural areas)
These projects will generate direct and indirect jobs temporarily,
forming skilled workforce in traditional construction systems and new
technological systems. In the period it aims to generate 414,600 direct jobs and
470,400 indirect jobs.

Goals for 2020:
208,300 homes built and improved by the State, achieving deficit reduction
28% quantitative and qualitative deficiency 30%.

Sports

The Bolivian sport during the neoliberal governments until 2005, was underestimated,
promoting their minority and even elitist practice.
From 2006, the new Plurinational State of Bolivia, recognized the sport, the
physical education and recreation character of fundamental right.
A significant advance was the institutionalization of Student Sports Games
Plurinational "President Evo" in the primary and secondary levels of education
National, with multiplier effects, generating the participation of more than 65,000
students in rural and urban areas of the country.
For the first time in the history of the country we set up the development of sports practices
with massive organizing foot races 10 Km "President Evo", which from
2013 generated great expectations and participation of the population, with an investment
prize of more than 8.5 million Bolivians.
40

As never before, we made significant investments in sports infrastructure throughout the
country, built around 455 sports venues, including
football fields with artificial turf, multifunctional, arenas, sports centers and others to
make sports.
Continuing compliance with constitutional mandates, our brother
President promoted the creation and historical incorporation of the Ministry of Sports
level structure of the central executive body as the governing body of the sport,
responsible for designing and implementing policies that promote the development of culture and
sports physical activity at all levels.
For the period 2015-2020, we propose:

Construction of 200 irrigation systems and basic sanitation in municipalities and
vulnerable indigenous and peasant communities and intercultural exchange
climate.

4. Revolution and technological and scientific independence
Knowledge and technology are essential to ensure productive development,
industrialization of raw materials and food production. Therefore, the
technological and scientific independence is important for sustainable development and
according to the country's needs. For many years this issue has not been relegated
It has been given the strategic importance it deserves, so in the coming years
We give a boost to the tasks for the development of science and technology.
43

Until 2005, during the neoliberal period, few centers of scientific development in the
country were closed and abandoned, as the Bolivian Institute of Technology
Agropecuaria (IBTA) and the Research Center of YPFB, among others, subordinating the
technological development of the country to the interests of transnational corporations and leaving
a backward, lagged dependent on foreign knowledge and Bolivia.
Starting in 2006, we gave our government for fundamental changes
transformation of the state, one being innovation, science and technology. In that
the Bolivian Innovation System (SBI) request that seeks to build framework created a
inclusive scientific and technological culture with its own characteristics. Moreover, with the
creation of the Bolivian System of Scientific and Technological Information (SIBICYT) seeks
recovery, integration and dissemination of science, technology and innovation
local and ancestral knowledge.
Since 2012, our government encourages the study of science through
realization of the Bolivian Plurinational Student Scientific Olympics in which
involved more than 270,000 students across the country, and support for Science Fairs
promote new talents in the student population.
For the period 2015 - 2020, we will intensify our efforts in science and technology,
looking to close the gap with neighboring countries, but above all seek the
knowledge generated contributes to the development of the country:


Nationally we settle for the National Council of Science and Technology
(CONACYT) as the highest instance of defining policies and strategies
technological country, and coordination with the university system and the industry
private. All research centers in the State will be brought under the tuition
This Council.
Build a scientific citadel, where all the focus centers
research and innovation in areas that are important for the country.
CONACYT will publish a specialized journal that incorporates
trabajaos research carried out in the scientific citadel and other centers
research for socialization.



The use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is a necessity for the country.
For this purpose an instance that specializes settle held
research and nuclear applications in medicine and energy use,
and form scientists in the country in this field.



We will offer full scholarships for graduate Bolivian professionals
Bolivian and foreign universities in strategic areas prioritized by the
Been.

Goals for 2020:
 To form the National Council of Science and Technology
 Build a scientific citadel
 Creation of a specialized body for research and application of energy
nuclear
 Full scholarships for Bolivian professionals graduate

Hydrocarbons

Ownership of the hydrocarbons passed into private hands, leaving a residual company will
evidencing that we were not owners of natural resources, and that YPFB was a
viabilizaba company that only residual expatriation of funds from the
oil activities. When we got to the Government, the proposed challenge was to reverse the
YPFB situation as a residual and re-position the company as a company
strategic controlling and administering the hydrocarbons sector. From 1st
May 2006, year in which nationalized hydrocarbons, the State recovers
ownership, possession and control of hydrocarbons. Also, YPFB is recast as
operator of the entire hydrocarbon chain and assume new challenges for
management of these resources.
The measures implemented after the nationalization produced results
strategic and important for the country, since between 2006 and 2013 the Bolivian State
had revenues totaling 22.218 million of dollars in oil revenues, the
representing an annual average of 2.777 million dollars, which exceeds by 15 times
corresponding to the oil revenues in the period 1997 -2004 average. 2013 income
He sets the record oil revenues reaching 5.459 million dollars for
the period 2015- 2020 is projected to generate an average annual oil income
6.188 million dollars.
The impetus was given to the oil industry resulted in significant increases in
hydrocarbon production during this period was producing natural gas 40
65 million cubic meters per day (MCF); liquid hydrocarbons and 49-64000
barrels per day (MBbl / day). YPFB Corporation and private operators working
for the Bolivian state investments totaled they conducted reaching historical figures
add 7.071 million dollars, highest figure by 281% over the period 2001-2005.
2014's record breaking investment program of $ 3,030 million.
Another important aspect is to cover domestic demand for liquid fuels, under this
outlook, refining capacity of refineries and increased Cochabamba
Santa Cruz from 40,051 BPD to 63,700 BPD. Special production Gasoline and Diesel
4. 5

Oil has increased by 66% and 13% respectively since 2006. For its part,
LPG production in 2006 was 933 MT / day, increased to 1,248 MT / day
2014 mainly due to the startup of the plant Liquid Separation
Rio Grande from May 2013, which has allowed supply the domestic market and
generate surpluses for export. Within this framework, the transport capacity
Pipeline has been increased as well as the storage winning 14 days of autonomy
both Special Diesel Oil to Gasoline.
Production of natural gas plus the pipeline expansions have allowed
providing energy security for the domestic market. As a result of policies
massification of natural gas, natural gas volumes sold in the market
Internal have increased substantially from 5.22 MCF of natural gas to about
MMmcd 10.6 in 2014 (an increase of 103%) covering demand sectors for
use in the residential, commercial, industrial, vehicular transport and thermoelectric sectors.
Moreover, the conversion of vehicles to CNG vehicles increased from 63,432 in the year
2006 to more than 320,000 vehicles in 2014.
Finally, in this period, Bolivia has become the most important supplier and
reliable natural gas in the region, established markets in Brazil and Argentina, not
only through the fulfillment of contracts for gas supply firm if not through
the signing of several interruptible contracts with Argentina in 2012 and in 2014
Brazil. In this context, the Bolivian gas has shown its competitiveness in terms of price
against the LNG imported by these countries overseas. This results in competitiveness
higher volumes of gas sent to Brazil MMmcd 24.6 and 36.8 MMmcd
Argentina 4.6 16.3 MMmcd MMmcd.
Under the Exploration Plan, 2011 - 2020, there is increased activity
exploratory, both traditional and non-traditional areas. To fulfill the
plan, until 2020 it is planned to increase hydrocarbon reserves of 10.5
Trillion cubic feet (TCF's) of natural gas and 291 million barrels of oil
liquids.
With respect to safety and changes in the energy matrix for the period 2015 -
2020, it is planned:



Internal self-sufficiency of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), gasoline and gas
natural.
500,000 vehicles converted from gasoline to natural gas vehicles reaching 45%
coverage.

For the first time in the country's history, we have ventured into the industrialization of
our hydrocarbon resources, which represents a quantum leap for the base
productive country. A first step in the transition towards industrialization, financed
entirely with national resources, it is installing Separation Plant
46

Rio Grande liquids and Gran Chaco. The latter allow the extraction of ethane and
propane, supplies for Olefins and Polyolefins Complex.

Mining

Mining was one of the activities that supported the development of the country. Nevertheless
product of neoliberal policies, the sector lost momentum, so the
downsizing of the state mining operations, such as lack of political
clear to the sector's development.
From our government, we have recovered the State's participation in the chain
productive mining, restoring the leading role of our company COMIBOL and
47

Colquiri nationalizing companies, Vinto and Huanuni. At the same time we have formulated
policies to strengthen the cooperative mining sector.
An important milestone was the development of the evaporite resources with the implementation of
Pilot Lithium Carbonate, plant whose operations began in January 2013
a capacity of 30 metric tons monthly.
For the period 2015 - 2020, we have planned new investments, hoping to generate
approximately 5,900 direct jobs and 23,600 indirect jobs. The proposed projects
that will enable the use of our resources will be the mineralogical
following:


Exploration will be invested in the following projects: COMIBOL, Mallku Khota
Concordia (Caracoles), Thuthu four exploratory phase projects; SERGEOMIN:
Charter geological, geophysical, geochemical prospecting, Laboratories,
Training and Capacity. Exploration projects in Potosi: The AsientoCerrillos and Pampa Grande II; Santa Cruz: Guarayos-El Porvenir and Corner
Tigre.



In production activities, through COMIBOL, we invest in the following
Colas :, Catavi sands projects, environmental management, tailings dam Khollu Wila,
Industrial plants potassium chloride, potassium sulfate and lithium carbonate,
Center for Research in Science and Technology-La Palca; Research Center
Metallurgical Mining (CEIMM); Financial services for mining

Electricity

The lack of investment in power infrastructure and policies access to electricity
in the neoliberal period it was reflected in a nationwide coverage of only 64% for
2001 and 67% in 2005. Since the implementation of actions and programs
aimed at increasing coverage, until 2012 reached national coverage
82%.
The nationalization of the electricity sector companies in the energy allowed the State
regain its strategic role. From this, the State runs the 75% capacity
installed for power generation and 67% of the transmission system, guaranteeing
electric service.
For our government, the annual average investment in power generation
It increased by 260% transmission and 73% for the years from governments
neoliberals. Until December 2013 the supply of electric power generation reached
the 1,460 megawatts (MW), taking a maximum demand of 1,200 MW, with a
260 MW reserve, ensuring supply for the whole country.
With energy integration policy departments of Beni (Trinidad, San Ignacio
Moxos, Reyes, Santa Rosa, Yucumo, San Borja), La Paz, Tarija and Chuquisaca
benefit of electrical service quality and lower rates, contributing to the reduction of
Grant hydrocarbons.
Another important aspect of our government, is the application of the rate Dignity from
2006 benefits 951 420 households (50% of all domestic consumers of the country)
allowing annual savings of 10 million users with a consumption
less than or equal to 70 kWh / month, corresponding to a discount of 25% on your bill.
Also, from the recovery of power companies, he allowed the
urban-rural in the departments of La Paz and Oruro tariff equalization.
During the period 2006-2014 adopted consumer-oriented measures and rational use of
energy. In 2008, we created the National Energy Efficiency Program, by
which implemented the National Programme for Incandescent Replacement Bulbs
Fluorescent lamps, achieving in its first phase (2008) savings of 72 MW and 12
MW. We also make education and awareness campaigns: "Move your
electricity consumption off peak hours "and" Light that you turn off, light not pay. "
Our efforts should not be there, for the period 2015 - 2020 we will continue
to the enterprises that benefit Bolivia:


Energy security and expansion of electricity infrastructure: By 2020
growth in demand for electricity will reach 2000-2300 MW, and
It is projected to add an output of 1,672 MW and 1,680 km of lines
transmission, ensure the supply of domestic demand and generate
approximately 1,000 MW surplus for export.



Export of surplus power: In this period starts
export surpluses of up to 1,000 MW to neighboring countries, to that end,
49

dynamics of implementation of the project portfolio is subject to the completion of
export markets, will develop the hydroelectric potential through
implementation of megaprojects such as Rio Grande Hydroelectric Complex, Rositas,
among others.


Diversification of the energy mix: The pipeline for 2020 will decrease
the participation of thermoelectric generation from 64% to 54% energy

Industry and Manufacturing

Until 2005, the manufacturing industry in Bolivia, like other sectors,
they had policies to promote and encourage its development; well, smuggling and
free trade negatively affected the development of domestic manufacturing.
During our administration, we have supported the manufacturing industry with intervention
productive complexes and prioritization strategies; the result was the creation of 22
productive complexes nationwide intervention. They also implemented
alternative instruments of market regulation, to ensure supplies
Internal and fair price to consumers.
The creation of the Enterprise Support Food Production - EMAPA drives
production of rice, wheat, corn and soybeans, working together with small and medium
producers nationwide, facilitating the supply of domestic market price
fair.
It should also include the creation of the Fund for Productive FINPRO Industrial Revolution, with 1,200 million for investment in productive enterprises
State generating surpluses.
The creation of a new institutional framework of comprehensive support to producers and producers
through government development agencies: PROBOLIVIA, BOLIVIA and SUPPLIES
BOLIVIA PROMOTES SENAVEX PROEX and to benefit all productive players.
The State also contributed to industrialization with the establishment of companies
Operating as PAPELBOL, Cartonbol, Lácteosbol, EBA. They are
implementation among the most important: the sugar mill in San Buenaventura, the
ECEBOL cement company in Oruro and the textile plant in Kallutaka camels.
For the period 2015 - 2020, we propose:

Tourism

Until 2005 tourism in Bolivia was primarily developed by the private sector,
with state participation only in promotional activities. Bolivia is a country
diverse in its geography, with the largest reserves of wildlife and water resources,
among others, it is allowing the country to develop ecotourism and consistent with the protection
with Mother Earth.
Since 2006, the State at different levels of government becomes the
protagonist of tourism development. The new State Constitution says the
strategic sector and provides for the decentralization of powers and
responsibilities to local authorities by the Autonomous Autonomy Act.
The main measures taken in the period 2006-2014 are:









Enactment of the General Law of Tourism.
It appreciates, encourages, promotes and develops tourism directly
Community.
International events like the Dakar 2014 were promoted.
International tourism grew from 524,000 tourists in 2005, 1.3 million tourists
in 2013.
Bolivians pushed for domestic tourism spending 1.9 million
tourists on 2005-2900000 tourists in 2013.
Tourism generated revenues above one billion dollars in 2013.
327 000 sources of direct and indirect jobs were created.
Empresa Boliviana de Turismo was created BOLTUR

To complement ongoing actions and generate the development of a Tourism Management
Sustainable, as part of a policy of positioning Bolivia as a tourist destination
with respect to indigenous peoples, customs and mother earth has been raised
for the period 2015 - 2020 the following goal: 2.2 million foreign tourists come to
country.
To fulfill this goal, the spread of tourist sites are expected through
Web sites and appropriate outdoor advertising. The following also will be addressed
Actions:

6. By producing our food
During the neoliberal period, they were not considered policies to ensure safety
with food sovereignty Bolivians. Donations of food and
particularly wheat flour, through programs such as the US PL 480,
they discouraged the cultivation of wheat and other commodities in the country.
In our government, we seek to ensure food security with sovereignty through
of production support, for which we create institutions dedicated to support various
aspects of production, marketing of basic food basket, food
with high nutritional value and strategic products at fair prices, to ensure
supplying the domestic food market, generating surplus value-added
for export and increase production of medium and small producers,
strengthening the agrifood complex, offsetting the deficit in the
wheat and rice, and avoiding speculation. With the implementation of these policies,
we reach the main achievements are:


National Institute of Agricultural and Forestry Innovation (INIAF) was certified
58,000 MT of seeds, and the amount of seed audited reached to 10,000 MT
May 2014.



Mechanization Program (PROMEC) and Upre delivered 3,942 tractors,
combines and implements, benefiting 187 264 families; which allowed
machined 374,528 hectares.



In the 2012-2013 crop year reached a record INSA and ensure
 secured 91,226 hectares
 57,410 2,489 producers in 63 municipalities communities
 7,601,460 B were compensated to 7,141 farmers affected
For the 2013-2014 crop year reached a record INSA and ensure:
 secured 175,814 hectares.
 105,870 producers in 4,627 communities in 107 municipalities.
 is expected to compensate at least in Bs. 8MM
Quinoa production of 95,530 MT in the 2013/14 season, three times what
achieved in 2005/06.
Exports in 2013 reached 35,063 MT by the record value of $ us
153 259 MM.




Our approach to achieving food security with sovereignty until 2020,
both in the East and in the West, it is:
6.1.

National Wheat Program (PRONATRIGO)

It promotes increased production of wheat grain, yield, quality, storage and
storage (silos), equipment, mechanization, production of quality seeds,
credit, technology transfer, technical assistance and training, and irrigation systems
micro irrigation.
In that sense, with the creation of PRONATRIGO is expected that by 2020 production
wheat cover at least 60% of demand.
54

6.2.

Production complexes in Piscicultura

Build in the departments of Pando (Municipality of Cobija), Beni (Trinidad)
Cochabamba (Chapare) and later in other departments and
regions with potential for fish farming from which production will be encouraged
meat and fish consumption in the country. Simultaneously, it will strengthen the
Trout production in the Lake Titicaca and the town of Pongo
La Paz department.
In five years we will reach to build 5,000 hectares of ponds (ponds)
semi-intensive production with three basins: Amazon 65%, 20% plateau and silver
15%, to produce 10,000 tons of fish meat for consumption and
trade. The current per capita consumption of fish meat is 2 Kg / year, and is expected
achieve by 2020 a per capita consumption of 5 kg / year.
6.3.

Program Mechanization and Modernization of Agriculture

To make more efficient agricultural production and use efficiently
natural resources, according to the production profile of the soil, will be developed
actions to:
or
or
or

Facilitating producer access to mechanization and automation, through
lines of credit and / or grants
Strengthen the capacities of farmers in the use and management of technologies, to
through the establishment of training centers and quality control
Support initiatives aimed at national metalworking manufacturing
equipment and agricultural implements, for their development and integration into the market
national.

6.4.

or

Comprehensive programs for small farmers, peasants and indigenous
to improve the conditions of agricultural food production

Expand coverage and deepen the comprehensive-financing programs,
technical assistance, training, markets, technology (mechanization and automation) and
marketing - for food production, both in urban areas and
rural.

6.5.

Genetic improvement to increase production and productivity

Increased geographical coverage of agricultural insurance universal 175000-520000
hectares.
Increased agricultural products 7-17 insured products.
7. Water for life and respect for Mother Earth

We understand Mother Earth as a living dynamic system made up of the
indivisible community of all living systems and living organisms, interrelated,
interdependent and complementary, sharing a common destiny. Mother Earth is
considered sacred to our cultures; and is home feeds containing, sustains and
reproduces all living things, ecosystems, biodiversity, societies
organizational and individual members.
Product model of predation of our natural resources driven
neoliberal forces, Bolivians have inherited a fragmented country,
an agricultural sector with irrigation systems without planning and abandoned, without
forecasts of watershed management and water management, lack of systems
and control mechanisms sewage, poor control mechanisms
air pollution, rivers, soil, and water; and a productive apparatus
predator of environmental resources.
In the civilizing horizon Living Well, we have set the collective construction of a
integral development in harmony with Mother Earth. Since 2006, we have achieved
significant progress:


State Constitution, which establishes the responsible use and
planned use of natural resources, promoting industrialization, through the
development and strengthening of the productive base in different dimensions and

56

levels, protecting the environment for the welfare of the present generation and
future.


Law No. 071 of Rights of Mother Earth, recognizing the rights of Mother
Earth as well as the obligations and duties of the Plurinational State and society
to ensure respect for these rights.



Framework Law of Mother Earth and Integral Development for Living Well, establishing the
vision and the foundations of comprehensive development in harmony and balance with Mother
Earth to live well.

During the period 2015-2020, we advance in the implementation and realization of all
principles, policies and strategies established in the Framework Law of Mother Earth, in their
various components:
7.1.


Water for Life

Water Resources Management

During the period 2006-2014, we conducted interventions in management and conservation 36
watersheds. Protection of water sources is important to ensure water
in sufficient quantity and quality, so its protection and conservation constitute
priority tasks to achieve accessibility. In this framework we propose:
or
or
or
or



Approve the Framework Law on Water for Life.
40 micro basins will consolidate the integrated watershed management (MIC) and prevention
flood.
20 bodies of water will have a platform for the protection and conservation
of the water.
30 municipalities will have an early warning system for the Prevention of
hydrological risks
Water and irrigation

The program's investment in the Water "MY WATER" I, II, III, created at the initiative of our

President and co-financing is agile and quick execution of irrigation projects
and drinking water in all municipalities. Between 20111 and 2013 it has been achieved
run a total of 114,000 household connections, public standpipes 2,516 and 37,000 new
hectares under irrigation, benefiting 270,000 people.
On the other hand, from other programs implemented, we achieved a further surface
irrigation of 68,000 hectares, totaling 105,000 hectares under irrigation at the national level,
allow to increase the productive capacity of small and medium producers
agricultural and benefit 81,532 families from 2006-2013.
2014 our president, after the success of the program and my water, has begun
MY IRRIGATION program implementation to accelerate and increase the coverage of land

Solid Waste Management

As a result of the emergence and growth of urban areas in the last 10 years, the
solid waste management has become a major concern
of the urban population.
Since 2006, our government has worked in four rural municipalities in Oruro,
reducing environmental pollution and protecting natural resources, and has
implemented waste utilization projects in intermediate cities and
big as Tiquipaya, Vinto, Sucre and El Alto.
We made the National Assessment of Solid Waste Management, and thus the
developing technical guidelines and the Draft Law on Waste Management
Solid. In addition, we developed the Microenterprise Program for Comprehensive Management
Solid Waste in 15 rural municipalities in the departments of La Paz, Santa Cruz and
Cochabamba.
For the period 2015 -2020, we will promote the implementation of the Law on Management
Solid Waste, emphasizing the prevention of waste generation, reuse
and recycling them, as well as the generation of medium and micro enterprises
recycling. Interventions are planned in at least 45 municipalities.

Integrating our Bolivia

8.1.

Integration road

In early 2006 we received a disjointed Bolivia, with few roads
communication and roads that interconnect the cities of Bolivia and the main areas
economic. Of 4,316 km of roads that had, most were in situation
serious deterioration for completing its life at the beginning of this century.
In our governance, increased progressively and sustained the
budget for public investment projects in infrastructure, encouraging the
the construction sector experienced unprecedented growth rates, with massive
employment generation and labor at all levels.
Through the management of the Bolivian Highway Administration (ABC), we reverse,
in less than eight years, the situation inherited from neoliberalism. If between 2001 and
2005 had built 885 km of paved roads, ABC managed to build between the
2006 and 2014 a total of 2,738 km, including the first double track in the country.
For the period 2015 - 2020, we are planning the completion of 5,368 km of roads
new, ensuring the paving of 100% of the national road network, which allows us a
more and better integrating the roadside; 2,951 km will be rehabilitated and finish the asphalting
of all integration brokers.

Rail integration

During the neoliberal period there was a decommissioning and abandonment of the rail system.
Now our government has implemented the policy of recovery and implementation
the national railway system.
Therefore, we propose the new Bolivia considers as an important basis for
development, production support, the revival of rail transport, ensuring
safety in operation, competitive rates, and strengthening the country as a hub
integrator and logistics center in continental issues cargo distribution. The projects
develop railway infrastructure in the period 2015 - 2020 are:


The bi-oceanic train, designed route from Puerto Busch goes to the port of Ilo
(Peru). In this period the designs are completed and construction will start.



The railway Montero - Bulo Bulo, implementation of a modern train is guaranteed
XXI century that it support the production of urea and ammonia plant Bulo
Bulo, permitting efficient, timely and competitive transport markets
internal and external.



The railway Motacucito - Mutún - Puerto Busch, a train from the station
Motacucito to the Mutún, 30 km, and from the Mutún to Puerto Busch, 100 Km,
thus reaching the Paraguay - Parana.



Puerto Busch cargo terminal.



Intercity express trains in Santa Cruz and Cochabamba.

8.4.

Fluvial and lacustrine Integration

To date, river transport was not considered as part of the system
communication that integrates the country, even though it constitutes one of the
mainstream media for the population in the north.
Therefore, to exploit this potential, we propose to incorporate this modality
national and international transport systems, starting with the implementation strategy
the project to improve navigation on the Ichilo axis - Mamore, which
will allow the speedy and free movement from Puerto Villarroel in Cochabamba until
Guayaramerín port in Beni, anticipating the construction of seven major ports
on the road, dredging and navigation improvement.

8.5.

Cableway

The cable car project between the cities of La Paz and El Alto was offered by many
Governments, however, the political decision to pursue this great project was taken
our government was able to implement it and make it a reality.
The cable car summarizes the willingness and ability of Bolivians to take on big challenges
signifying the major projects implemented urban public transport is a
creative solution to the problem of mass transport between the cities of La Paz and El Alto.
Considering the successful implementation of mass transit our cable
government, we propose the implementation of a second phase in which the new lines linking
other areas and neighborhoods in the cities of La Paz and El Alto.
9. Caring for our present to secure our future
During the neoliberal period that lived Bolivia, social policies were virtually
nonexistent knowing and deepening the neglect and exclusion of groups more
vulnerable of our population.
The new constitutional framework, guaranteeing the fundamental rights of all people,
is for the State compliance. Between 2006 and 2014 our government, in the
framework of Community Social Protection Network, implemented measures and interventions
They prioritized attention to the most vulnerable groups of our population.
For the period 2015-2020, we will continue to strengthen state policies oriented
eradicate "all forms of discrimination based on sex, color, age,
sexual orientation, gender identity, origin, culture, nationality, citizenship, creed
religious, ideological, political or philosophical affiliation, marital status, economic and social condition,
type of occupation, level of education, disability, pregnancy, or that have at
purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, in conditions
equality, the rights of every person "(Article 14 EPC)

9.1.

Increases in income and bonds, according to growth
economy

The distribution of wealth was not evenly applied between policies
during the neoliberal period, most unlike the prevailing idea was the first to grow and
then distribute,
Since 2006, our process of change promotes equitable distribution of
wealth and economic surplus for the eradication of extreme poverty and
reducing inequalities. Thus, with the recovery of natural resources and
64

redistribution of income, the engine of domestic demand was reactivated, allowing
the country to grow steadily, registering a rate of economic growth
5% annual average in the last eight years.
The economic surplus a proper time and for the benefit of Bolivians, is
redistributed, especially among poor people, through
transfer (Juancito Pinto, Juana Azurduy bonus, Dignity Pension), higher
public investment, cross-subsidies and wage increases.
For the period 2015 - 2020 the continuity of payments to guarantee Renta Dignidad
the population of the elderly, the Juancito Pinto bonus for school children and youth
secondary and Juana Azurduy bonus for women who are pregnant and children up
two years. The increase of these benefits will depend on the growth of our
economy.

One of the first measures of the government of President Evo Morales was the adoption of
Law No. 3925 which has allocated the financial resources were granted to parties
politicians in the neoliberal period, for people with disabilities, reaching this
annual amount to Bs 40,000,000.; half of these resources for the Solidarity Income
People with severe and very severe disabilities and the rest for programs and projects,
directly benefit the sector.
For the first time in history, the rights of people with disabilities become visible
in the new State Constitution, in Articles 70, 71 and 72; in this framework
He advanced in the regulatory environment regarding the protection and quantifiable benefits for this
population group, among which may be mentioned:

On the other hand, they have been established benefits such as lowering fares in transport,
granting personal papers for free (military service book,
certificate of birth, marriage and death), mandatory employment by 4%
the total staff of public enterprises, guaranteeing their job security, no
only for the person with disabilities but also for parents, spouses

For the period 2015 - 2020, considering the type and degree of disability, skills and
potential of this population, training programs will be implemented and
training dignify the lives of people with disabilities through the
generation of productive enterprises through competitive grants, which promotes
self-employment and welfare approach is exceeded. Also to effect the inclusion
social and economic, as well as professional, technical and managerial potential,
compulsory integration of people with disabilities, parents and promoted
tutors and the staff of public and private organizations, ensuring
accessibility and an enabling environment for the performance of their duties.
9.3.

Women with full participation

The policy of the colonial and patriarchal state historically has violated the rights of
women. Since 2006, with the vision of the new Plurinational State, we assume this
problem in its real dimension; and during the period 2006-2014 are implemented
measures of social transformation whose support the CPE.
In the political field, we have advanced with the participation of women in instances of
political decision; according to statistics: Senators 44%, 22% deputies, mayors 6%
councilors hold 43%, 28% respectively departmental assembly,
constituting an unprecedented development in the history of the country and Latin America. Until the
2020, political participation of women in decision-making promoted to
reach a fair and equitable level.
Laws No. 348 (Act comprehensive guarantee women a life free of violence) and
No. 243 (Act against harassment and political violence against women) aim at
establishment of mechanisms and comprehensive prevention, care and
protection of women in situations of violence; prosecution and punishment for perpetrators, with
In order to guarantee women a decent life and the full exercise of their rights to
Live good.

66

During the period 2015-2020, we will prioritize the adoption and implementation of standards
programs that enable women to realize their full potential as económicoproductivo members of society and community.
9.4.

Comprehensive development of children

The State Constitution establishes a comprehensive conception of being a girl, child
and adolescents; they are recognized as full members with all their specific rights
condition of people in the development process, their ethnic, cultural, of
gender and generational, promoting inclusion and protecting them from labor exploitation,
forced labor and all forms of violence.
In this context, we seek to create a comprehensive development of children, facing to
This comprehensive development centers "Happy Childhood and Adolescence", "Wawa cusicuy" "cusisim
wawa "," mitacuña Mirai ori ", based on a participatory model that assumes construction
philosophical precepts of the new Code of children and adolescents with ethnic identity and
cultural practices exercising family, community and social life, as well as
dispute resolution.
This challenge necessarily must be shared between the national and levels
subnational.
9.5.

Integrated policies for the prevention and treatment of pregnancy
planned in adolescents and youth.

In recent years in Bolivia, an increase of teenage pregnancy it is evident,
many of which were unplanned, limiting its potential for development
Integral also restricting their employment opportunities.
In these eight years in office, we have formulated comprehensive policies that assume
fundamental aspects from the social, economic and cultural, with an emphasis on attention and
comprehensive guidance to youth and adolescents about their sexual rights and
Reproductive.
Forward is necessary to continue prevention programs pregnancies
planned and work on policies that offer alternatives to teenage mothers

Comprehensive policies for prevention and rehabilitation of adolescents and
young drug addicts and alcoholics.

In the past the rights of individuals and social groups were ignored
vulnerable, ie in the country had no specific plans and programs
sustainable for the treatment and rehabilitation of people with problems
67

drugs and alcohol. This deficiency in the national health system and the set
Public institutions involved have failed to meet the expectations of society,
mainly because of the lack of resources needed to address this issue and others
afflict public health in Bolivia.
In this context, existing treatment centers and rehabilitation were absent from
and strengthening support by State authorities. Thus, in the vacuum of legislation
that would facilitate employment and social integration of people undergoing rehabilitation through
other drug. Our government proposed actions that promote the full exercise
the rights of the young people, framed in the Youth Law No. 342, which
marks an important and recognized landmark in understanding the perspective of youth as a
strategic factor of development. Management 2015 - 2020, we propose building
3 comprehensive rehabilitation centers for teenagers and young people with problems
addiction, co-financed by the national government, state governments and municipalities.

9.7.

Young protagonists of change

Young people are a fundamental part of our society and constitute the human talent
from which we warrant our desires in the future. However, their participation
and economic policy has historically been restricted; many of them begin life
working in precarious jobs and low wages, or are unable to access a source
employment.
Our government in the period 2006-2014, developed active policies in the areas of employment and
oriented enterprises dignify youth work, in order to combat or prevent
unemployment, mitigating its effects and support the workforce at risk of unemployment,
promoting productive community social economic model, generating conditions
technical, economic and productive to facilitate their development through training and
youth training. In this context, the My First Job Worth, benefited
around 5 000 young Bolivians.

For the period 2015-2020 propose addressing the following programs and actions:

the sovereignty of the new Plurinational State will recover, assuming the policy,
strategy and actions from our own nationality, without expecting any guideline or

citizen has become a focus of concern in the large cities of Bolivia,
against which the Bolivian police have launched a series of actions to
fight.
To ensure greater security of both urban and rural population, it is necessary

11. Revolution on justice and fight against corruption.
11.1.

Revolution in justice with a congregation

In the neoliberal period justice it was one of the instruments of regulation of life
social-economic on a selective basis, class, discriminatory, exclusionary, inefficient and
DVD unequal power relations.
The legal system was formal, general and abstract nature, its management was discursive
and little compressible, not solve legal disputes rightful and lost in
Extensive procedural delays that slowed justice.

72

This court, corrupt and inefficient, power had also become a mere loot
the groups that came to power. The same systems for electing their authorities
They gave rise to that, and forcing those who wanted to exercise the judicial function, counting
with the support of those in power through the executive and the legislature.
Our government proposed building a Plural Justice System in order to
decolonize the justice system, root out corruption, speed up court proceedings,
develop a new behavior in the administration of justice, with a component lot
more human and social, respectful of the rights, principles and constitutional guarantees,
with full recognition of legal pluralism, coexistence of ordinary justice
native peasant indigenous jurisdiction that enjoys equal status, thus eliminating the
monopoly on the administration of justice.
Despite all the efforts made since 2006, with the installation of a
Constituent Assembly with broad social participation, approval of a new
State Constitution, the election by direct vote of the judges and
judges, the development of new legal regulations and special assignments
resources, in order to change the justice in our country has not been reached. We have not
managed to eradicate the evils of the legal and justice system has stalled.
Retake the initial objective involves making major changes in the whole system
court, so we propose the following lines of action:

11.2.

•

Installation of the Assembly in the Revolution of Justice Digna
social participation

•

Law and Constitutional Reform Referendum for judicial change

•

Judicial organic production rules, laws and moral codes,
harmonization of regulatory procedures for transparent justice

•

10,200 legal professionals and trained human resources for
new justice

•

Peace and social justice reunion: 27 conciliation centers.

Fight against corruption

Before 2005 there were prosecuted corruption nor sanctioned corrupt, it was allowed
impunity, this assertion is borne out in the absence of sentences for crimes
corruption.
In the past, the information generated in public administration had no mechanisms for their
dissemination, public information owned by the rulers and no right of citizens.
The "confidential expenses" were established in benefits to concentrate wealth
personal, there was clear evidence of the dark and arbitrary management of resources
public.
In 2002, within the structure of the Executive is created, a small Technical Unit
Fight Against Corruption (UTCC) Secretariat subsequently was named Fight
Corruption and Special Policy (SLCC) which operated until 2003.

Since fiscal 2006, our government with a real political decision to fight
frontally against corruption, creates the Deputy Minister for Transparency and Combat
Corruption, as a forum for citizens to file complaints, which
these facts are investigated and prosecute those responsible to be convicted.
In 2007 we developed the first National Policy on Transparency and Combat
Corruption in which the pillars of transparency and fighting corruption are established
with the aim of transparent governance. In 2009, we created the Ministry of
Transparency and Fight against Corruption with a mandate to "Zero tolerance
corruption ".
The March 31, 2010, our government enacted Law No. 004, Combat
Corruption, Illicit Enrichment and Investigation of Fortunes "Marcelo Quiroga Santa
Cruz "that severely penalizes public corruption offenses; incorporating new
crimes such as embezzlement, allowing research fortunes server
public and former public servants; The trial in absentia of the accused escapes
fraudulently the course of justice; and measures that will recover property and assets
defrauded or embezzled by corrupt acts.
As part of this policy of transparency and fight against corruption established by
our government, we have achieved:


74

•

We created the Integrated Information System Corruption and Recovery
State Property (SIIARBE).

Government for the period 2015 - 2020, continuing with the premise of transparency and
zero tolerance for corruption, we propose the following lines of action:
11.2.1. NOT STEAL (Ama Suwa)
Is not "cashing in" with impunity or cover up corruption. As
we will face hard ventures the following:
•

Regulatory reform for procurement of works and services, fast,
transparent.

•

A Multinational Observatory with citizen participation, conduct a
rating of progress Transparency and Fight against Corruption.

11.2.2 NOT LIE (Ama Llulla)
Is publishing the information management of the state, open governance and
provide it to the public. For this implement:
•

Intersectoral and concurrent policies to expand public accountability
accounts, subnational governments and public enterprises.

•

Development of Electronic Platforms in public institutions, which also
will permit the exercise of the right to information and social control, as well
monitoring by citizens to their paperwork.

•

Simplification and de-bureaucratization of procedures as public policy.

11.2.3 NOT LOOSE (Ama Qhilla)
Appropriate at this stage of life of the Plurinational State, sow force
and progressively in the moral and ethical principles of public servants
effort, punctuality, sacrifice and probity, which will promote the:
•

Implementation of the Decolonization Policy Plurinational Public Ethics
and Revolution and Behavior in Public Servants.

11.2.4 Modernization of the State Electronic Government and simplification of procedures.

The modernization and bureaucratization of the state has not kept pace with the
economic and social transformations achieved by our government. Our
President Evo Morales has been doing in recent years, efforts
significant to ensure universal access to Information Technology and
Communications Technology (ICT) so that all Bolivians can enjoy its benefits,
75

promoting social inclusion and contributing to the country's development. This is why
we see in the Electronic Government an opportunity to improve and strengthen
processes transparency and social control through greater access to information
generated by different public entities.
This involves making adjustments and improvements to the current regulations, with a greater emphasis
in a Plurinational Public Administration Act to replace the current SAFCO Law and its
subsystems (programming operations, administrative organization, budget,
property management and services, personnel management, treasury and public credit,
Comprehensive governmental accounting and control) and a new Law on Procedures
Administrative aimed at improving and modernizing the management of the state.
The process of bureaucratization that we propose, will enable for the year 2020
reduced to one-third the time and steps of procedures in real rights record and
liquidation of companies and taxes.
In parallel, the implementation of e-Government in the State lead to
deployment and extension of multiple online services for the population. This will
that at least 50% of government institutions offering online services
requests and complaints enable more agile without the
population displaced from their home or workplace. This particular benefit to
communities located further away from population centers.
This, coupled with the use of our satellite Tupac Katari, community telecenters,
provision of computers, digital education policies, among others, facilitate the
participation and access of the population in the processes of consultation, planning and
proposal of public policies and the provision of services.
It also considers implementing a single information system that allows the
State institutions articulate their information systems, making efficient use of
time and public resources. This will enable to 2020, at least 50% of the
Executive Branch institutions have integrated their computing platforms to a
single platform.
Through the implementation of free software and the use of open standards in the
different levels of government, we look forward to technological sovereignty from
systems development and applications designed according to one's needs
of our people, from being a technology consumer country to a producing country. TO
the time is to reduce public spending on purchasing licenses to redirect
these resources towards the development and strengthening of technological capabilities,
improving investment efficiency and use of resources.
