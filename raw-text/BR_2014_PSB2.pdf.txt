Our commitment
In October 2013, the Brazilian Socialist Party and the Sustainability Network have decided to make an alliance which they called "programmatic" because
It is based on a program of action for Brazil. Our proposal addresses the
institutions, companies, civil organizations, each citizen, in short,
the whole of Brazilian society, with which we want to form a more
broad alliance around an agenda of profound changes in the way
of politics and of social and economic development model
our country.
Since the beginning of this journey, we have experienced with new intensity
challenges and discoveries, overcoming difficulties and dilemmas, always seeking to reaffirm the high ethical and social purposes that inspire us.
We have experienced, first in ourselves, the challenge of making the political realignment that we propose and we aim to Brazil.
For this, we can not fail to recognize that in the last two decades, Brazil has evolved positively in strengthening civil society.
Debelamos a devastating inflation, the currency became stable
and the economy, less vulnerable. Millions of people came out of condition
poverty but social inequality still mark our society.
We are the sixth in the world economy, but we can not give education
quality and ensure good health care for all.
To go any further, there is a challenge that the Brazilian society needs
take: build a development model which gives the notion of
progress towards a more humane, just and solidary with people
and the planet, with current and future generations. A model
deeply committed to democracy and development with
sustainability.

These challenges will only be met if we have the courage to change
and commitment to society. With the same means and wealth
that we have, but for other purposes, methods, concepts and knowledge, you can plan a strategic transition to the development of new type. This is the essential task to position
Brazil in reality marked by global environmental crisis, social and economic of great proportions, powerful enough to put in
Sheikh practices and attitudes that characterize today the idea of ​​progress.
We continue insisting on a conception that can not turn into development strategy our prime condition
holder of environmental heritage, cultural diversity and unique entrepreneurial spirit.
Brazil is home to a significant part of biodiversity and freshwater
existing on the planet, large expanse of arable land, diversity
ethno-cultural as well as a rich variety of natural formations whose
role is critical in continental and global climate balance. However, political institutions and the successive governments in recent decades, have not absorbed and given relief to the crucial role of sustainability
in the development process.
This is a reality that does not only environmental issues and needs to be understood in its multiple dimensions to build
public policies in an integrated and transversal way. To promote such
Review concepts and establish a bridge between Brazil gift
and the future, a quality education is essential, forming the
citizens committed to a joint social life and prepared to
the challenges of an ever more demanding information society and
knowledge. This is the founding basis for an economy that responds
these challenges, promote the reduction of social inequalities and improving the quality of life, considering the set of multiple forms
of thought and expression of the various segments of the population without
sectarianism that divides the country or the homogenization that annihilates the role of
State in reducing inequalities.

Government Program

We do not want to see Brazil parked in a stagnant political environment. We are determined to advance democracy in a new understanding of the role and state management that dialogue is indispensable
standing with the citizens, as well as organized groups of society. This is the only choice consistent with the objective of
socially just development, environmentally sustainable and focused on quality of life for all, in a broader sense than just
those measured by economic indicators.
Our effort to be faithful to such purposes reflected in the method
adopted in the preparation of the government program, collaborative and open to
participation. Gathered thousands of people in seminars
programmatic in 5 regions of the country. We conducted thematic workshops with
leading experts of the country in strategic topics such as Economy, Energy and Environmental Policy. We receive and aggregate contributions
representatives from industry, education, agrarian sector and others. We dialogue with the social groups organized in the women's movement,
union, popular, black, LGBT and youth. And in addition to contributions
groups and organized sectors of the Coalition parties, received thousands of suggestions online, on the site where we record and publish
all our debates, analyzes and proposals.
This process has been deep policy learning for all
those who participate and at the same time, demand great intellectual
to expand our ability to mediate the diverse and legitimate interests
that go through a government program. One of our main challenges
- And learning - has been to identify the strength of traditional political culture
and find ways to overcome it with responsibility and creativity,
every step and every situation faced ..
We know that change does not happen without that identify the innovation centers that germinate within the old structures and it is these that
diligently seek to thicken, making fruitful and multiply. It is not
simple operation, because it is a paradigm shift. A

Introduction
In a world convulsed by profound crisis of political, social,
economic, cultural and environmental, we socialists and sustentabilistas Brazilians, dare we hope to raise a flag. We believe in Brazil and its people,
we feel that the country has effectively faced with the possibility of change
significantly its present and future.
From this perspective, the US Coalition For Brazil has three goals
and a method key. The first goal is to maintain the achievements of the past
decades and make them move, realizing, however, a critical assessment of the process set in such a way to maximize the elements that dialogue with
autonomy and popular emancipation, taking the legitimate social demands of their
fulfillment. The second objective is to democratize democracy, updating the decision-making processes to the new reality of the digital age, driven by
coexistence of multiple stakeholders. The third refers to build the foundation
for a lasting cycle of sustainable development with broad participation
of all stakeholders in promoting progress socially just, environmentally
sustainable and liberating the creative potential of mankind.

Government Program

Our method of acting is radically new and is founded on the co-construction of platforms, policies and initiatives, based on ongoing dialogue
with citizens, and civil society organizations. It is reorganizing the state and public policies, through a collaborative effort in which
rulers and ruled are processing agents, promoting a better quality life. We therefore decided to make a program to society,
and not only for the society.
The programmatic nature of the Coalition is derived from these objectives and method
associated with these. For them to be faithful they must, first, to identify the values ​​and build ideas, on which the program is elaborated
government to then define political and electoral strategies compatible.
It is anticipated that way how the Coalition intends to rule the country.
This is not an episodic encounter with the people in the narrow time of the election.
Our platform is participation and a new quality of democracy, which
based public management on continuous assessment, interested and duly empowered by the population. Preference is given, thus the horizontal joints,
permanently animate the party structures, making them permeable
the aspirations and demands of society in a lasting way.
The current political model demonstrates exhausted by the deep contradiction between innovation disability and renewal of political institutions and the
general interest of society, with its clear desire for change. Its about
a paralyzing model of social energy.
It is necessary and urgent step forward. Based on this strategic agenda for the country, the political forces can establish a renewed dialogue with the
society and place themselves at its service, performing necessary realignment
progressive camp in Brazil. The new agenda needs to unite social justice and sustainable development, regional balance, in the same equation. For this, we need to change the level of priority we give to education, science
and technology and innovation. We must hear the cry of the streets and be consistent with
the wishes of the overwhelming edge of disadvantaged who crave true inclusion and
full citizenship. Integrate the new players in the Brazilian Democracy, recovering
true sense of the res-publica. Establish an honest relationship, eye to eye,
the dynamic and creative mobilizing new energies being
continuously proposed by youth from all tribes and social groups.

When interpreting the aspirations and popular emergency - taking into account their
history, difficulties, contradictions and conflicts - a government becomes capable of

achievements and advances, however, are always partial, insufficient and need
reorientation, there are rare situations that requires the overcoming of political
which in the past have been deemed appropriate.
Thus, economic stability and coping policies
poverty and inequality need to be broadened, deepened and improved.
The very democracy requires a continuous process of democratization, that
reach all aspects of life and all sectors of society.
The model ran out before our eyes, but the political forces that operate
strive to keep it by trading pieces of the state and handing them to the
delay to remain in power. This setback is expressed in the deterioration
essential public services, corruption, inefficiency of management, erratic and disjointed choice of priorities, the degradation of environmental assets,
the inability to plan the growth of cities, increasing violence and
the intensive use of budgets and public institutions such as personal advertising machines and partisan of the rulers.
The political cycle that is now out and is founded in its inadequacies,
demand changes. It is these changes that the US Coalition For Brazil wants
engaging and this is the way it proposes to lead.

Programmatic axes for the new
Sustainable development cycle
In the ranking of inequality, we are the second country in the G-20 and the fourth of
Latin America. Our development model is predatory and exclusionary because it undermines the natural basis of growth itself. The construction of a more just and sustainable society is a large-scale task, in any
size one wants to consider. It requires a development concept
incorporating these multiple dimensions.
Our Coalition believes that the development is the set of
all conditions of social life that promote the full realization of personality

In addition, it needs to restore and qualifying land reform that promotes the development of the field with social justice, ensure access to land and welfare for
the families of small farmers in rural areas, especially with targeted actions
the technical and financial support to the production in the settlements and educational development for children and young settlers.
In urban areas, it is necessary to create incentives for entrepreneurship, to
solidarity and creative economy, and the economy of knowledge and innovation,
consolidating them as key vectors for the scientific, social and economic development of the nation and potential job-creating and income.
It is essential also to restructure the productive chain of tourism, in order to

business environment at the local level, aiming to continuously increase the flow

d) Social policies and quality of life
Social policies should contribute decisively to combat the
inequalities, to improve the distribution of income and wealth, to the expansion of happiness, quality of life and population welfare. In this sense
it is essential to ensure universal access to public goods and services. IT IS
State's duty to ensure the population access to quality health care, housing
and healthy surroundings from an environmental point of view, endowed with infrastructure
sanitation, with access to all relevant public services.
The SUS is one of the major social achievements of recent times
democratic, to be valued and have improved their management so that
to ensure comprehensive care and quality. The Primary Care
health should be effectively universalized, constituting up in single-port
entry of health services except for medical emergencies. This precept
It requires an enormous effort of organization of services, including towards
joint units of different complexity levels with each other.
In order to promote improvements to health and not just take care of diseases, one should apply the practice of sports and physical activities as part of
concept of comprehensive health care. Likewise, it is essential to strengthen
intersectoral cooperation between social security policies, education, culture and security in order to ensure the service to the population, taking
into account the profile of families, with priority given to families headed by women, their needs and territorial potential.
It is also necessary that the overcoming of poverty becomes political
in state policy, which will establish long-term objectives and
prevent discontinuity of programs and actions, with the additional aim of freeing it of bargains of any kind. We appeared before a
matter of state action focusing, as it is to involve all
social policies and have specific attention on the population segment of high social vulnerability.

1.1

Reform Policy
The contemporary crisis of politics is, in large part, a crisis of electoral representation, which has political parties tools for mediation between elected
and voters. This system no longer produces sufficient interest, which shows the
weakness of representative democracy. It is therefore necessary, in addition, create new mechanisms of popular participation that allow even
the strengthening of representative democracy, increasing its legitimacy. THE
policy needs to reconnect elected and voters.
• Establish the possibility of single applications, extinguishing the requirement of
party affiliation so that the citizen can contest elections.
• Review the campaign finance legislation to lower the campaigns and
reduce the influence of economic power.
• Expand the use of direct democracy instruments such as referenda and
referendums.
• Decrease the number of signatures required to propose projects
law of popular initiative.
• Improve the mechanisms of participatory democracy, such as the advice of
rights with representatives of civil society to expand its functions.
• Establish the purpose of re-election to office, establish mandate
five years and unify the electoral calendar.
• Create, innovate and use new information technologies extensively to involve the public in decision making on matters of public interest and
competence of the executive and legislative matters.

1.2

Public administration reform
It is necessary because we complete the professionalisation of public administration in
Brazil, with merit as the defining element of selection, promotion and evaluation of public boards. Front of our persistent patrimonial history,
This challenge continues even after the numerous changes that have occurred since the
creation of the Administrative Department of Public Service (DASP) in 1936,
the Vargas government. There are few islands of excellence in the public sector, which need
be expanded to many different areas of the state. Administrative reform
necessary reaches across all management dimensions: organizational structure, administrative procedures, financial and budget management, management
personnel, purchasing management, participation and citizen control, e-government

• Set the rules and infralegal framework to the new federal model, favoring the federal collaboration, coordination of policies and the reduction of
overlaps between the subnational entities.
• Increase legal instruments such as the Law on Public Consortia, which enables
cooperation between federal entities.
• To promote tax reform in order to strengthen and ensure greater
autonomy to states and municipalities. This reform will have the guidelines in addition to the
decentralization of resources, system simplification, tax justice and

• Establish new form of governance of metropolitan areas, which enables the solution of common problems to municipalities that make up these

vegetables genres that lend themselves to energy and industrial applications. This condition
It requires the country to develop a strong national defense policy, compatible
with its strategic importance and national interest that that is the 6th
economy in the world.
• Develop the defense industrial base, with the acquisition of all technologies and industrial capabilities necessary for Brazil to reach the necessary
autonomy evaluation, decision and action in defense of its sovereignty.
• Implement actions to strengthen sectors such as space (satellites and rockets), naval, strategic communications, cyber defense, radar, air defense and advanced aviation.
• Create linkages with the private sector, so that it is interested in

Conclusions
The US Coalition For Brazil understands that Brazil is faced
the achievements cycle of exhaustion started with the process of
democratization, which brings impacts in the political, economic and social.
The hegemonic arrangement that has led the country does not express comprehensively
the legitimate aspirations of civil society, because it was captured by interests linked to the very maintenance of power. The economic performance lost momentum, and
country grows at unacceptable levels, without realizing that there are new possibilities for expansion with higher value-added activities stimulus because of
more efficient and effective use of natural resources. We were not able to change form
substantive inequality, which limits the scope of anti-poverty actions.
In this context, the Coalition presents as a novelty, because it proposes
act politically from programmatic axes that should guide the commitments to be undertaken in the construction of governance. Makes a resolute choice of
sustainable development, comprising technological qualification of the economy
National valuation of our environmental assets and prioritizing issues such as infrastructure and simplification of the various processes involving the production of goods and
services in order to create conditions for increasing our productivity and competitiveness. Porta a conception of democracy that empowers participation and for that
medium, qualifies the popular representation which will contribute effectively
to improve the state's performance in the production of quality public services.
To guide its activities the Coalition elected five themes that understands correspond to the main challenges facing Brazil, which are indicated below.

State and High Intensity Democracy: The US Coalition For
Brazil proposes the changing political and federal Brazilian model
means of state reform, as this is one of the conditions for a
High-intensity democracy and a development model more
fair and sustainable. A state capable of mobilizing what is best in
society and the marketplace and has as founding element values
such as freedom, the search for the common good, collaboration and participation. In this context, new technologies have an essential role as they allow greater participation in decision making on
public policy and a more efficient and active social control. We propose
a new federalism, which breaks up the power and strengthen - with the corresponding resources through tax reform - the autonomy of states and municipalities in the tables in our constitutional framework.

Educação, cultura e inovação: A Coligação vai estabelecer a escola
como local estratégico para o enfrentamento das desigualdades e a melhoria da qualidade da educação. Para isso, é fundamental o estímulo à
valorização e à qualificação dos professores para assegurar mais competência e mais compromisso com a aprendizagem e a oferta de conteúdo
aos estudantes que esteja vinculado aos conhecimentos de interesse do
mundo atual e ao resgate do valor do patrimônio cultural brasileiro. A
educação integral estará aberta a todos e fortemente vinculada à vida
de sua localidade e à diversidade cultural. Assumimos um compromisso
radical com o fim do analfabetismo e com a articulação das políticas de
ciência, tecnologia e inovação com a agenda educacional brasileira. Ou
seja, precisamos superar a exclusão em seus dois extremos. De um lado,
o que impede o acesso à cidadania plena pela falta de conhecimento básico. De outro, o que limita a formação de gerações que possam contribuir para o aprimoramento da base tecnológica do país. Ambas situações
excludentes são perniciosas para quem deseja estar integrado ao futuro.

Novo urbanismo e o pacto pela vida: Assumimos o compromisso de
fazer uma ampla e profunda reforma urbana, com o objetivo de melhorar
significativamente a qualidade de vida da população nas cidades. Para
tanto, realizaremos articulações com estados, municípios e a sociedade
e apoiaremos iniciativas na área de mobilidade, para diminuir o tempo
gasto nos trajetos urbanos e melhorar o conforto dos usuários do sistema público de transportes. Propomos, com a sociedade, com as polícias,
com a Magistratura e Ministério Público, um pacto pela vida que ofereça efetivamente segurança aos cidadãos e reduza substancialmente a
violência. Para superar o déficit habitacional de mais de 6 milhões de
unidades, que atinge principalmente a população de baixa renda, implementaremos uma política habitacional subordinada aos interesses da
população, compreendendo o acesso aos bens e serviços públicos, como
o saneamento ambiental e as ações relativas ao meio ambiente. A Coligação promoverá políticas de cultura, esporte e lazer, integrando-as às políticas de juventude, com a finalidade de ampliar o convívio na diversidade
e aumentar a disponibilidade de bens culturais e alternativas de lazer e
recreação da população.
