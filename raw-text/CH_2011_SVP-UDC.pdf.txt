Commit to
Switzerland
Switzerland performs better and freer than
other countries. In Switzerland, the last word
to citizens and citizens. Switzerland equal quality,
safety and diversity. These forces, Switzerland owes to
independence and originality. Switzerland
selected direct democracy, independence and
neutrality. A local currency brings us
economic stability; respect for privacy
protects citizens and gives them freedoms. These
benefits and these gains must be defended. For
this, the SVP must win the federal elections in 2011.

No to EU membership
If Switzerland is today if
good position at international level, particularly through the 'no'
the Swiss people to the EEA in 1992.
That does not prevent many
politicians and civil servants, animated
selfish motives, want
pushing Switzerland into the EU. The membership request of Switzerland to the EU
is still lodged in Brussels. Gold,
if entry into the EU, the Swiss people would pay two
times or even three times. Join the EU,
it is for Switzerland to lose direct democracy, independence,
neutrality and Swiss franc. Drop
wages, higher unemployment,
rent increases, more
taxes, charges and fees
and payments by billions in Brussels, that the consequences of EU membership.
Limit immigration
Under different scenarios established by the
Confederation Switzerland could
count to 10 million in 2035. This is a consequence of uncontrolled immigration. The Federal Council policy

of massive and uncontrolled immigration and lax justice.
This is why the SVP

FOREIGN

Limit
immigration
By accepting the free movement of people and
opening its borders, Switzerland has given up control immigration. There is hardly any other country
world where many foreigners live by
compared to the indigenous population in Switzerland.
The consequences of this situation for infrastructure, rents, land prices, land
planning, energy consumption, schools,
public health or social institutions
are serious.

citizen has the right to live safely at home and
moving. But almost everyone today

FOREIGN POLICY

Not for membership
EU
The objective of the foreign policy of Switzerland
defined in Article 2 of the Federal Constitution: "The
Swiss Confederation protects the freedom and rights
the people and ensures the independence and security of the country. " A membership to the EU is incompatible
with these principles. The Constitution also requires the
Federal Council to resist political pressures
other states and defend the interests of Switzerland.
In recent years, the Swiss government
Largely ignored this constitutional mandate.

Swiss interests prevail
The majority of the Federal Council and
Parliament would like to bring
Switzerland in the EU rather today and tomorrow. These environments
continue to work so
certainly more insidious than before,
but nevertheless hard
to bring Switzerland into the EU.
If they refuse to withdraw the application

Brussels, it is only because
they want to join the EU. They
deny the negative consequences
of joining the EU, as
disadvantages of various agreements
negotiated with the EU. The problems
posed to Switzerland by the free movement of persons, by agreement
Schengen or by the principle

Cassis de Dijon are becoming
more apparent. But the Federal Council still wants to conclude other
treaties, such as an agricultural free trade agreement
the EU, which would have consequences
disastrous for the agri
c ulture
Swiss. If Switzerland is not yet
member of the EU, it is only
through its "special case" or
including its direct democracy
which allows the people to participate
in political decisions.

DEMOCRACY

Stronger rights
People
Switzerland to prepare for accession to the EU, policies and teachers seek to restrict
rights of the people. If it goes according to the will of the Council
federal, popular initiatives of the invalidation grounds will be expanded and "warnings" will
printed on the signature lists. These
backgrounds sabotaging the application of initiatives accepted by the people as the initiative on the dismissal or
the initiative against minarets. They want to remove
rights to the people and giving more in return
to the authorities and the courts. It's out of
question for the UDC.

The Federal Council,
Administration and
Other parties undermine
increasingly the
rights of the people:
- The whole of international law
is placed at the right
International imperative, therefore
superimposed by Swiss law. Consequence of decisions
the people in the ballot box are not
applied. The last example
dated is the refusal of the Council

on the referral approved by
the people, so to expel
foreign criminals.

essential content of constitutional fundamental rights ". Yes

review of prior material
initiatives with a "warning" on the lists of
signatures. Consequence: all
initiatives to displease

a warning.
- The Federal Council wants to introduce
the Constitutional Court and

justice. Consequence: the last

COUNCIL OF STATES

Shedding Light on

Council of States
Once bourgeois bastion and guarantor of stability

shed light on the decisions and reports

UDC is a representation to the Council of States
consistent with its political force.

Dragging left
The Council of States has slipped sharply to the left in recent years. Once considered a "sure thing" capable of correcting in
the sense of bourgeois politics
the mistakes made by the Council
National, Little House has
changed. The consequences of this distressing development are revealed in
many files processed during
this legislature. For example,
Council of States has consistently opposed attempts to toughen
criminal law or to stem immigration. Meanwhile, he agreed

The legislature will come primarily

the other parties carefully avoid taking a clear position
facing the EU. The UDC, however,
believes that its priority task is to
ensure that Switzerland concluded
no colonial agreement with
the EU. But to achieve this, it must strengthen its presence in
Council of States. To give
