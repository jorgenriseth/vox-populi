The

 These

They

  already
  two

  from

current.
 
 
we are

The

  of
 G - 20
 They have
  generated
 important
 Agreements
 world,
  but
  yet
 
we must
 apply
  with
 vigor
  in
  all
  the
 aspects
 on
  to
  the
 ordination
  of
 
system
 financial,
  to
  the
 persecution
  from

  to
  the
 fight

 to the
  Brake
  to

  to
  the
 limitation

In

 claim
  a
  higher
 presence
  from
 
the
  policy.
  Him
 claim

  should
  get it back

  than
 believe

considered
 unacceptable
  than
  he
  destination
  from
  the
  life
  from
  millions
  from
  people,
  from
 their
 
jobs
  Y
  from
  their

 dependent
  from
  some

 Financial
 
international
 whose
 decisions
 affect
  to
  the
 economy
  from
  a
 country
  by
  above
  from
  the
 
volition
  from
 their
 own
 representatives
  politicians
 elected
 democratically.
 
For
  do
  front
  to
  is
 legitimate
 demand,
  we need
 changes
  in
  the
 governance
 
international
  Y
 European,
  for
  get it back
  that
 space
  for
  the
  policy
  than
 demand
  the
 
citizens.
 Changes
  as
  never
 necessary
  for
  power
  get out
  from
  the
 crisis.
  Since
  he
 
government,
  the
 Socialists
 will promote
  Y
 will support
  the
 proposals
 directed
  to
  to advance
 
with
 steps
 decisive
  in
  is
 governance
 European
  Y
 global.
 Today
  in
  day,
  more
  than
  never,
 
be
 progressive
  is
 equivalent
  to
  be
 internationalist.
 
In
  all
 case
  the
 update
  of
  draft
 social democrat
 It required
  than
 we go
  more
 
there
  from
  their
 slope
 economic,
  Y
  than
 elevate
  the
  sight
  by
  above
  from
  the
 Current
 
problems
  of
 unemployment,
  the
 debt
 public,
 or
  the
 Settings
 budget.
 
  The
 
Social
  arises
  from
  a
  draft
 moral,
  from
  a
 conception
 solidarity
  of
  be
 
human,
  from
  the
 aspiration
  from
  promote
  their
 realization
  personal,
  from
  the
 idea
  from
  than
  he
 
progress
 single
  alone
  can
 achieved
  with
 justice
  in
  he
  framework
  from
  a
 progress
 
collective,
  from
  the
 conviction
  from
  than
  do not
  can
 have
  developing
 citizen
  in
  freedom
  without
 
a
  base
 common
  from
 equality.
 
Modernize
  he
  draft
 social democrat
 It required
  also
  than
  let's go back
  to
  fight
 
decidedly
  by
  the
 ideas,
  in
  he
 debate
 philosophical
 and
 intellectual.
  But
  about
  all
 
It required
  a
 new
 legitimation
 based
  in
 results.
  The
 citizens
 are
 identified
 
with
 those
 projects
  politicians
  than
 put
 their
  values
 to the
 service
  from
 programs
 
politicians
 able
  from
 generate
  a
 society
  more
 thriving
  Y
 cohesive.
 
Since
  he
 government
  from
 Spain,
  the
 Socialists
 we
 Fronted
  the
 challenges
  from
  is
 
crisis,
 trying
  combine
  the
 reforms
  Y
  the
 Settings
 necessary
  with
 measures
  for
 
cushion
  he
 impact
  in
  the
  people
  than
 They have
 lost
  their
 employment.
  Our
 priority
 
They have
 been
  always
  the
  people:
 protect
  in
  the
 moments
  from
  higher
 difficulty
  Y
 
help them
  to
  find
  a
  new
 arrangement
  in
  a
 society
 changing.
  Now,
  when
 
us
 headed
  from
  new
  to
  the
 citizens
  for
 convey
  our
 proposal
  from
 
future
  we must
  be
 conscious
  more
  than
  never
  from
  the
 opportunities
  than
 are
 open
 
in front
  from
  we.
 
  We must
  to take advantage of
  the
 conjuncture
 economic
  for
  walk
 
rapidly
  toward
 news
  shapes
  from
 produce
  Y
  to work,
  from
  to exchange
 goods
  Y
 
services,
  Y
  toward
  a
  new
 order
  economic
 International.
 
 
The
 difficulties
  than
  the
 crisis
  is
 creating
  do not
  may
 us
 lose
  the
 certainty
  from
  than
 
in
 terms
 Historic
  there are
 reasons
  for
  be
 optimistic.
  Each
  day
 check
  how
 
our
 companies
 are
 They transform.
  The
 hope
  from
  life
  from
  the
  people
  is
  each
 time
 
higher.
 We attended
  to
  a
 process
  from
  big
 migration,
  the
  which
 shape
 
companies
  with
  higher
 wealth
  cultural.
 They
  is
 producing
  a
 Unstoppable
  Advance
  from
  the
 
equality
  between
 men
  Y
 women.
  He
 knowledge
 are
  is
 spreading
  between
  the
 
citizens
  of
 world
  Y
  the
 equality
  from
 opportunities
 are
  is
 consolidating
  in
  a lots of
 
places
  where
  until
  ago
  little
  I was
 unthinkable.
 
Is,
  by
  so much,
  he
  moment
 historical
  from
 say
  than
  do not
  alone
  we want
 watch
  Y
 
analyze
  the
 changes:
  we want

  from

  with
 our
 ideal.

We have

  the

  a
 dimension
 
intergenerational
  than
  goes
  more
 there
  of

  from

  We must
 fight

form
  from

We have

By

a healthy and competitive economy

II. A HEALTHY AND COMPETITIVE ECONOMY
1. The recovery of growth and employment on solid foundations
Spain, like other countries of the European Union and other economies
Western, it is going through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression
the 30s of last century. The global financial crisis that began in 2008 has been
transformed in the last three years in a severe economic crisis of real character,
with job losses and business closures.
Our country is suffering more than others the problem of unemployment. that is
following a pattern begun in the mid-90s, which relied on
low productivity sectors capable of creating many jobs, but little
qualifications and little stability. The 'Spanish miracle' rapid growth over
EU, based on the construction and related industries, has shown so
dramatic limits. He has left us a huge property bubble and a level of
private debt like never before have we had.
This is the inheritance of an economic model that defended the cause of the strong
rising housing prices was the lack of soil. Who thought
soil by passing a law in 1998 solved the housing problem, by making
that all except Spain was considered developable protected areas, clearly
wrong. We have taken a huge oversized industry
property (we have built more than half a million new homes per year for
nearly a decade). They have led to an unsustainable urban development, which occupies the territory
voraciously and disorderly.
The Socialist government that took office in 2004 identified the need for a
changing the economic model, and since the first legislature began to put
the foundations for growth on more solid foundations. The major problem in
Spanish economy is the low productivity growth, and this is only
meets with innovation and modernization efforts and investor with a vision
strategic. To promote this change they were launched between 2004 and 2008
large number of different multi-year investment plans: R + D + i (Ingenio Plan
2010), information and communications technology (Avanza Plan), or in networks
Transportation (Strategic Infrastructure and Transport Plan), among others. And in
this term the Socialist government approved the Sustainable Economy Act,
overall objective pursued by the change of economic model for Spain.
We need to transform the Spanish economy because it is our future. The
economic crisis forces us to change, but is also an opportunity to solve
the structural problems that have placed us where we are. Besides serving
the most urgent short-term problems (job creation, reduction
public deficit, improve competitiveness) remains a need for a vision
medium and long term investors and maintaining efforts in those areas
They have a strategic importance for the country

- 10 -

a healthy and competitive economy

The objectives that we pursue in economic matters are double
Nature:
-

-

Short term: tackle the most urgent challenges
•

restore economic growth

•

create jobs

•

reduce the level of public and private debt

•

get a normal functioning of the credit market

In the medium and long term: addressing the major challenges for our future welfare
•

improve the productivity of the Spanish economy

•

diversify our production structure

•

increase environmental sustainability and contribute to the fight against
climate change

•

meet the needs and demands of a population with low birth rates and
which it has seen an increase in life expectancy

The recovery of growth and sustainability in the medium term depend on
we are able to correct the imbalances and achieve lay the foundations for a
more competitive economy. Overcoming this crisis will not be easy, and requires further
that international stabilization of all European economies is achieved
to overcome the turmoil in the debt markets and re-grow. But
our internal structural factors are critical to the long term and also
we can influence them with our initiatives and policies.
Spain must complete its modernization to the new economy under criteria
competitiveness, productivity and with a clear objective to lead our efforts in the
3I call + D (innovation, internationalization, research & development). For the
Socialists, the new economy is the economy of prosperity, which not only generates
economic growth with redistribution, but also social cohesion, increasing
the quality of life of citizens. This economy will be innovative, sustainable and
inclusive, and in her role companies have called social economy,
which widen employment options for citizens because more
sectors that lead the future growth.
2. A financial system at the service of society
The financial system plays a fundamental role in society, as a channel of
credit to households and productive sectors, and as a fundamental element for
allow the existence of investment. The financial system should serve the
society and not vice versa. Financial institutions must be financially sound, sustainable,
healthy and profitable in order to ensure proper operation and does not
pose a burden or for states or for citizens.
The role of states and central banks in financial supervision should be
higher than in the recent past, since the existence of excessive risks has

- eleven -


 


 

a healthy and competitive economy

gone unnoticed by regulators. The international financial deregulation
for more than two decades it has encouraged irresponsible risk-taking by
part of financial institutions and its spread to countries and people who do not
caused. Therefore it has favored the excesses of indebtedness of companies and
families, and thus imbalance in the growth of many economies.
The scope of the crisis has highlighted the need for solutions
coordinated in Europe and globally. At first it was indispensable
bank restructuring to safeguard financial stability now
we need to promote a balanced, controlled and supervised financial sector,
and a greater contribution of the sector to society.
Therefore, a central element of our electoral program is to establish the
conditions so that, before the crisis, the financial system is no longer part of
problem of the current crisis and become part of the solution. We need a
system capable of financing growth and to commit to the
financing of productive and job creation investments. Definitely,
We need a financial system at the service of society.
2.1 return to normal credit market in Spain
Spain has a well-regulated banking sector and virtually unaffected by the
problems of subprime mortgages (mortgages with very low quality
United States) and those linked to these toxic assets. Although it has suffered from
2008 in its financial system the consequences of an irregular functioning
international markets.
The closing of the usual channels of external financing of our economy has
provoked situations of lack of resources in the financial system, which at the start of
it was possible to tackle the crisis at the national level with the instruments of liquidity
launched by the Government, as the Asset Acquisition Fund
Financial created in 2008
But the worsening economic crisis, the bursting of the housing bubble and the
problems of instability of the debt markets have ended for cause
a situation of great tension also in the national financial system. Banks and
Boxes are now suffering the consequences of years of lax policies
lending and excessive concentration of risk in the sector
living place.
The Socialist government has addressed a reform of the financial system to help
solving problems of banks. A necessary reform because
Spanish economy can not afford that credit will not flow normally to the
businesses and families. A reform that aims to boost confidence in the
Spanish financial system and accelerate the process of strengthening and consolidation
Savings Banks.
The key points of the financial reform are: (1) creation
Restructuring Fund and Bank Management (FROB), to help the process of
bank restructuring aid with a volume of 10,600 million euros
They have been granted as loans to entities (and thus will be returned to
public) coffers; (2) approval of the Banks Act that, among other things,
- 12 -

a healthy and competitive economy


 

empowers banks to raise private funds for recapitalization and advances in the
professionalization of its managers; and (3) implementation of the Plan to Strengthen
Financial Sector in 2011 with the aim of restoring the credibility of
entities and strengthen its solvency and facilitate the channeling of credit to the
real economy.
In the next term we have to close this adjustment process system
Financial, thereby causing again become the source of credit for
transformation of the Spanish economy. A financial system that, in any case,
You can and must defend the activity of savings banks for their social commitment and
capillarity in the country. And if in the process of restructuring the State
enters the capital of a financial institution, we will make sure to make a
sound management of public money, favoring lending to small and
medium enterprises.
The financial system is the engine of the economy, growth and employment. By
So our first objective has been to preserve its strength carrying out the
deeper than the recent economic history of Spain restructuring. Without
But this is only a first step, necessary but not sufficient. In
hereinafter overcome the most difficult moments, it is necessary to work for a
also structural objective: we must design an appropriate financial system to
function that must be met, an efficient system that provides credit to
businesses and the overall economy, well controlled system, a system that
encourage irresponsible risk taking, a system that ensures
fully protecting the most vulnerable and, above all, a system that
contribute more to society, conceived so that return of the
it benefits obtained.
Our proposals to restore normalcy in the domestic financial system are
the following:
-

Complete the process of restructuring the system. Entities not
They reached the required minimum levels of core capital should run
recapitalization strategies before end 2011, and will otherwise
implement actions necessary to complete the healing process
system to gain credibility and have access to normal
international financial markets to raise funds. All efforts and
resources should be geared towards this objective.

-

Reinforce controls the operation and management of institutions
financial and establishing penalties when their managers
show bad banking practice.

-

The possible use public presence in any financial institution to
boosting finance to entrepreneurs.

2.2 Increased investor protection and financial literacy
We need new forms of financial regulation, more agile and more efficient.
To provide more information to buyers of financial products on the
They take risks to make their decisions in full knowledge, and
this information is clear and transparent. And offering a greater degree of

- 13 -


 

a healthy and competitive economy

protecting citizens. Only then can avoid the excesses of the past,
prevent future systemic risks potentially caused by the spread between
entities and facilitate economic growth.
To this end, we propose the following measures to improve the protection of
Users of financial services:
-

More financial information: the amount, speed and complexity of developments
financial products make the best measure of protection for the user is
develop basic financial culture that allows them to make their own
decisions, and protect them from the risk of being exposed to the risk of investing and
hire they do not understand.

-

We intend to further improve the financial literacy of the country, as
eg portal "Finance for All", developed by the Ministry of
Hacienda- economy and make it reach a broader section of society.

-

More protection in the financial sector: to date have been taken
urgent steps to protect the families who have lost their homes guaranteeing
one inembargable vital minimum to allow them to meet their needs more
essential. Also, they have launched several initiatives that, if
foreclosure for nonpayment occur, debtors receive
adequate compensation for the property, preventing the holder from
the house well below its value. It is necessary to develop a stable framework
to ensure these rights.

-

We will develop a new code of transparency and protection of users
financial services; modern rules including rules on
responsible lending, pre-contractual information to be
provided to consumers, or improved procedures agreements
debtors and creditors before proceeding, in case of default, the implementation of the
Mortgage.

3. A fairer tax system that encourages job creation
Taxation is the main instrument for the necessary state funding
Welfare and public investments. Therefore, the tax system should be sorted according to
the principles of efficiency, progressivity and sufficiency, providing resources
necessary for the proper functioning of public services quality, and
taking into account the existing territorial tax singularities.
In recent years, the tax burden has fallen three points, to 32% of
GDP, which is being 7 points below the European average. This was due,
on the one hand, measures of fiscal support to SMEs and improving income
household disposable adopted by the Government in the toughest stages
crisis and, secondly, to the reduction of overall economic activity and its special
impact on revenues from the real estate sector, which had been providing
substantial income for all public administrations.
The PSOE is fully committed to the implementation of the plan
fiscal consolidation agreed in the EU framework, which aims to recover
investor confidence in the Spanish economy and budgetary stability
- 14 -

a healthy and competitive economy


 

in the medium term. In this circumstances, a general reduction in taxes,
as irresponsibly it proposes that the right is not supported in these
circumstances with the fiscal consolidation process, and would jeopardize the
sustainability of our welfare state and our ability to invest in the
recovery.
Socialists defend the budgetary stability, fiscal equity and
adequacy of resources to sustain public services and benefits
social and invest in the future economy. We also advocate transparency
income and spending, and the fight against tax fraud.
Therefore, we need to address a review of our tax system so that
those who have more to contribute in ending the crisis. A revised tax system
allowing better support positive behaviors (such as work,
entrepreneurship and savings and productive investment) and discourage those that generate
negative externalities (such as pollution or speculation). Therefore, we
will:
1. Improving the fairness of the tax system through a more progressive and
more balanced treatment of the relationship between labor income and capital.
2. Achieving budgetary stability. The PSOE is fully committed to
compliance with a fiscal consolidation in order to maintain confidence
of investors in the Spanish economy through prudent fiscal policy and
aimed at budgetary stability throughout the cycle, without giving up our
signs of social identity.
For socialists, budgetary stability is specified in achieving balance
between revenue and expenses in the time horizon of each economic cycle,
It involves state power to compensate for the economic policy measures
booms and depressions cycle and possible emergency which may
arise.
3. To preserve the welfare state. On the side of public spending, the priority objective
for socialists it is to preserve the welfare state and social cohesion, so
the need to intensify efforts to rationalize spending and improving
the effectiveness and efficiency of its management. Especially important is our
commitment to improving the quality of educational and health services
guarantee pension benefits and unemployment.
4. Investing in people and the new economy. We pledge to strengthen
our investments in people, so they can adapt to new
economic realities and activate their skills in finding new jobs.
It will also be essential to continue to invest in training and technological capital
human, and to support emerging sectors within the new model
productive.
5. Increased awareness and commitment of society to the fight against fraud
prosecutor. A country that wants to guarantee and improve their services and benefits, which
You need to ensure the enjoyment of social and individual rights and should promote
economic growth and employment policies and affirmative action
large public investments should be aware that compliance with the

- fifteen -


 

a healthy and competitive economy

tax obligations is not only a duty for all but an inexcusable condition
citizenship. In this sense, fiscal reforms to achieve a fairer system
transparent and must be accompanied by greater involvement of citizens
in fulfilling their tax obligations and a greater collective effort in the
combating fraud and crime.
3.1 Increased tax equity with really progressive taxation
The initiatives proposed below complement the wide range of
measures that the socialist government has adopted over the last legislature
to increase the progressivity of the tax system. These measures and
can stand approved raising the taxation of savings in income tax, the
increasing the maximum marginal rate of income tax, or hardening of taxation
professionals who earn very high incomes multiannual.
Furthermore, the Government decided in 2008 to suspend the application of the tax
Heritage, a decision made in a very different economic context from which
now we live. At present, it is imperative that decisions
provide resources to finance rigorous measures to boost employment
we want to implement in the new legislature. Therefore, the socialist government
He has recovered the Wealth Tax, incorporating the necessary amendments
for average incomes remain exempt.
The proposed new tax that will promote the transformation model
growth and job creation by reducing administrative burdens
unnecessary, and focusing the tax incentives and public funds in support
innovation and entrepreneurship, irrespective of the legal form,
also including the social economy.
To improve the progressivity of the tax system in Spain, our proposals are
the following:
-

Modify the corporation tax to redistribute the benefits of the
tax deductions, from large companies to small businesses
and medium, so that both pay similar annual rates and more
Nearby nominal rate.

-

Create a tax on the profits of financial institutions. It's about
ask an effort to benefit the companies that have obtained in the above
growth cycle that now contribute to finance measures to
promote job creation and boost the economy out of the crisis. East
also it generates tax incentives for financial institutions to act
responsibly in credit management, not taking excessive risks.
Specifically, we propose a new tax figure similar to that which has
established in other neighboring countries such as Sweden, UK,
Germany, France, Portugal or Austria, among others, and there is therefore
comparative experience. A tax should be implemented, when
Financial institutions have completed the restructuring process that
They are subjected to strengthen its capital and meet the new requirements
imposed by regulators and supervisory bodies.

- 16 -

a healthy and competitive economy


 

-

Create a new tax on large fortunes, which will replace the renewed
Heritage tax when it expires in 2012, that will achieve the
progressive goals and include a new taxation SICAV.

-

The global financial crisis of 2008 has opened an international debate on
introduce some regulation in pay systems managers
of large companies. At European level began to address remuneration
executives with an approved by the European Parliament directive
November 2010. Since then several countries including the US, France or
Germany have taken steps in this direction. The Socialists propose
also in Spain improvements made to the systems of remuneration
the managers of large companies, including:
•

Increasing transparency by publishing the remuneration
perceived individually by each member of the Board, including
compulsorily the information in the financial statements.

•

Support schemes extension workers systems
remuneration that apply to managers, including bonuses and stock
options, in order to properly align the positive incentives
all.

In addition, we intend to strengthen socialist tax base. In Spain the level
indirect taxation is the lowest in Europe in relation to GDP. Specific,
amounting to 9% of GDP, 4 points less than the eurozone average (2009 data).
Beyond VAT rates, which are within a reasonable range, the difference
essential with our European partners is to lower indirect taxes
designed to discourage behaviors that generate negative externalities
the environment.
In this sense, in our country the so-called 'green taxation', or set of
tax figures that contribute to the responsible use of natural resources and
mitigate negative environmental impacts, it is very underdeveloped in
Compared to neighboring countries. To pursue our goal of
the Spanish economy reaches a higher degree of sustainability, these are
instruments used to encourage responsible behavior.
Therefore, we propose the following set of measures:
•

Increase taxes on alcohol and snuff, except wine, beer
and other low alcohol drinks, to ensure the financing
public healthcare.

•

Within indirect taxation, green taxation is the most you can
evolve in Spain as it is poorly developed in relation to the
neighboring countries. However, since the onset of the economic crisis
at local and regional level they have proliferated so-called tax
environmental, particularly energy. The General Administration
State has a wide margin of action in the field of green taxation
from two perspectives:

- 17 -

a healthy and competitive economy


 

or

Sort the heterogeneity of environmental taxes
regional and local and provide them with legal certainty (as many of
these taxes are appealed in court).

or

Introduce higher environmental standards in taxation, since the
Revenue from environmental taxes in Spain is the lowest in
across the EU.

3.2. Austerity budget
The public sector in Spain also requires a transformation to accompany
the process of change of the Spanish economy. We must ensure that resources
audiences are used to support private sector activities are not
merely grants or aid programs, but real levers that stimulate
the private sector.
A good example of this philosophy we have in the policy of R + D + i carried out by
the socialist government in the last two legislatures. While public investments
designed leverage private investment, so that you have more resources and
synergies between what the public sector does well and what it does well the sector
private.
In the short term, we are faced with a scenario of fiscal consolidation requires
a policy of maximum austerity and efficiency, both in the management of the various
public spending policies and the functioning of the administrations own
public. But austerity does not mean simply reducing public spending. Assumes
be more efficient and responsible management of resources, increase
quality public services and improve coordination between different
administrations.
But the Spanish economy will surely overcome this crisis and to help the
recovery and transformation of the economic model that we will generate
wealth and prosperity in the coming decades, changes are needed in the area
the public sector, to transform it into a boost for the economy.
We need to continue to deepen our commitment to drive from the field
public greater territorial cohesion, so that economic activities are not
an exaggerated focus on selected areas, leaving other
with problems of lack of population and abandonment of the territory, which entails
loss of human capital and environmental effects.
For socialists the principle of budgetary stability means austerity in
expansionary phase of the economic cycle to meet the needs in the phase
contractionary cycle and maintaining social cohesion. Therefore, the
budgetary stability throughout the cycle allows the implementation of policies
necessary to combat the economic downturn, while ensuring
Welfare State.
The sovereign debt crisis suffered by Europe and which has worsened in recent
months, it has become necessary constitutionalise Initially, stability
budget, and built for years to our legislation.

- 18 -

a healthy and competitive economy


 

The biggest challenge to which we are short-term in the field of
public sector, and the Socialist Party defends for the next term is
complete the process of fiscal consolidation to achieve the deficit target of 3%
of GDP in 2013, and from there continue the consolidation of public accounts
to regain a balanced budget.
Our proposals to address the challenge of austerity are:
-

Continue the process of reducing the public deficit in all general government.

-

Provide citizens with the opportunity to invest in their personal income tax returns
Special government debt securities to one to two years, small amount
nominal, for those taxpayers who wish have an
simple and cost-effective tool to support the country to achieve greater stability
financial and out of the crisis. In practical terms, it would suffice to make a
box on the tax return for the tax authorities to carry
out all the paperwork to make the investment.

-

Promoting a political agreement between administrations to improve control and
coordination of public policies, promoting the introduction of incentives
(Positive and negative) or spending rules which ensure the control of the deficit and the
Total indebtedness (financial, commercial and public companies), to
ensure compliance with the Stability Pact and European growth.

-

Avoid overlapping and duplication of responsibilities among the various levels
public administration.

-

Austerity and transparency in the conduct of public authorities, including
measures and prevent accumulation of wages.

-

Minimize production costs of public goods and services by
measures such as the generalization of centralized purchasing, unified management
public housing stock, facilitating electronic procurement, etc.

Other areas of improved public sector efficiency:
-

Increase collaboration and coordination between all levels of the
Administration, avoiding duplication and promoting synergies, making
further adjustment in those policies that are not priorities enhancing
evaluation of public policies and programs, but keeping resources
necessary for social and territorial cohesion.

-

Dealing with public sector arrears, an imbalance that hurts the
all companies and workers dependent on them. To achieve
This objective is transparency and information in order to ensure that the
subcontracted to exercise their rights against the prime contractors

3.3 Increased awareness and commitment of society to the fight against
fiscal fraud
To promote the fight against tax fraud, in which we are already performing well
results, several actions are proposed:
-

To fight with all forcefulness and maximum efficiency and tax fraud
to prevent and suppress money laundering, propose the creation of

- 19 -

a healthy and competitive economy


 

an Office for the Fight Against Fraud specialized nature that
integrate administrative bodies currently play this type of
functions. This Office will establish a new model
Fight against fraud integrate officials and bodies involved
in the fight against tax and customs fraud, social security fraud,
frames for organized fraud, prevention and suppression of money laundering
laundering and combating financial aspects of crime
organized crime and corruption.
-

Also, we develop a plan to combat fraud aimed
It will ensure that this will become a priority of powers
public and society as a whole in the next legislature.

4. The drivers of change: Innovation, New Technologies, Science and Culture
The Socialist government is strongly committed since 2004 by a change in policy
research and innovation. In the last five years our country has invested more
R & D than in the previous ten years, reaching the European average investment
public R & D. At present, major scientific infrastructure emerged in
years successfully compete in the international arena. Now is the time to give
a leap to put us on a higher level of international leadership
development of scientific and technological knowledge.
Undertake, Evolve and Expand There are three themes for a national project that, more
beyond the end of the crisis, think the new production fundamentals on
that the economy will grow in the 2012-2016 legislature: a term marked by
innovation, and where the change of energy model, climate change and the process
aging society are three major challenges to address.
Therefore, we propose the renewal and strengthening of a social pact
help supplement the efforts made so far on key issues for
place the Spanish science in its rightful place. A pact that puts the
emphasis on knowledge transfer from research into tissue
industry and business.
The Information Society is a reality in Spain. Our country highlights
international level in most of the indicators, either use as
connectivity. However the achievements with the Avanza Plan should not be
allow ourselves to become complacent.
The incorporation of Information Technology and Communication (ICT) in
productive, educational, health, social and administrative fields is one of the
main levers to improve business competitiveness and creating
employment.
ICTs contribute decisively to a sustainable welfare oriented economy
citizenship, the elimination of inequalities and the strengthening
democracy and its institutions by improving transparency, collaboration
and citizen participation.
The Spanish culture is one of the great cultures of the world, is a factor
reinforces our legitimate pride as a country and strengthens our reputation
- 20 -

International: We have a huge monumental, historical and artistic heritage;
Spanish is spoken by 500 million people worldwide; our creators
and artists have historically enjoyed and now enjoy recognition
world; our cultural companies are leaders in the international context

Since 2004, the cultural policy of the socialist government has value, time
First, the economic aspect of the Spanish culture, our Industries

Cultural and creative industries have played a major role in the new
post-crisis production model based on the knowledge economy. Have,
also a high potential for quality job creation, since the application
Work in the area factor is higher than average and does not require high
investments.
4.1 Innovation and Economic Growth
Within the Sustainable Economy Strategy, which calls for the change of model
economic in Spain, socialists conceive innovation policies as
way for the scientific and technical effort is used by the whole
society and allow the modernization of our production.
We pay special attention to the public-private partnership that promotes
investments and initiatives to achieve improved productivity of our
economy. To this end we propose:
-

Update the State Innovation Strategy to extend their temporary field
until 2016, strengthening cooperation between the various actors, particularly
Autonomous Regions and Municipalities, doubling the number of innovative companies, and
promoting knowledge transfer.

-

Articulate a national system of early demand in collaboration with all
public administrations, and in close collaboration with the private sector,
especially in the areas of specialization of the Spanish economy.

communication in these processes allows them to be more efficient and austere
so that, at lower cost, provide equal or better services

-

Encourage the establishment of investment funds and venture capital capitalsemilla mixed in the public and private sectors to enable the financing of
innovative initiatives.

-

Alternative Stock Market boosting growth enabling initiatives
innovative, providing them with liquidity and allowing other investors to participate in
the financial opportunities offered.

Likewise, we make an effort to innovate in sectors that have been
come to call traditional: the necessary renovation and modernization of many of
our sectors of economic activity should rely on innovation as
lever for change. We propose:

4.2 Information Society: new horizons and new opportunities
The solutions that the information and communications technology (ICT)
provided are one of the keys to economic growth and creating
employment, for his outstanding contribution to a sustainable economy oriented to
welfare of citizens, to eliminate inequalities and to strengthen the
democracy and its institutions, by enhancing transparency,
collaboration and citizen participation.
ICT has a major influence on economic growth and the generation of
quality jobs for their contribution to increasing competitiveness, so
the growing relationship between economy and ICT has led to the concept of
"Digital Economy". Some of the key factors to be considered in
this new economy Internet, e-commerce, content and services
digital or new models of relationship through the Internet.
The Socialists propose the launch of a new Agenda Spain 2.0
containing the set of actions of the Government of Spain for the development of the
information society, such as the development of infrastructures
communication; promoting the supply of services and content; promoting

- 22 -

a healthy and competitive economy


 

information security and data privacy on the Internet and networks
telematics; setting standards for the interoperability of
devices and services; and improving the training of all citizens and
workers in particular in the use of ICT and encourage investment and
entrepreneurship in the sector and the entire Spanish economy.
The priorities of the Digital Agenda Spain 2.0 propose the following:
-

Starting the SME Plan 2.0 must achieve full implementation of the
technology by developing sectoral plans. SMEs should
become active agents of knowledge in the use of tools and
ICT solutions, and integrated into a model of network economy.

-

Promote the adoption of new business models and the introduction of new
working methods through the use of tools 2.0, by measures
disclosure and incentives.

-

Create poles of attraction or national resource centers
entrepreneurs internationally recognizable as a specific measure for
location technology start-ups related to the Internet, because of its high
potential for future growth in turnover and employment, which is empowered and
facilitate its operation (a digital HUB).

-

Promote innovative public procurement as an effective means to enhance a base
technological and industrial modern and competitive Spanish.

-

Develop a Strategic Plan of the Telecommunication Development
It will consider the deployment of telecommunications networks and support ultrafast
market development of mobile broadband.

-

Encourage public-private partnerships, so that investments in
hardware, software and necessary civil works, including modernization
common telecommunications infrastructures in housing are conducted
the fastest pace possible in the coming years.

Proposals to deploy a very fast Internet to help the economy
grow, and to promote their use and thus achieve maximum use of your
potential:
-

Extend the minimum speed of access to reach the EU average
European in 2016.

-

Encourage the extension of coverage of telecommunications networks last
generation and advanced electronic services to the entire population, making
emphasis on rural and remote areas to achieve technological development
equitable and non-discriminatory.

-

Establish greater control and tighten demand for quality service
access so that commercial tenders comply with the reality of service
I borrowed. Actively promote free competition, with the aim of achieving a
decline in access prices paid by users.

-

Promote Connected Citizenship Plan aimed at developing a comprehensive
administration focused on citizens. The objectives of this plan should be the
sustainability, austerity and efficiency.

- 2. 3 -

a healthy and competitive economy


 

-

Closer to a "paperless" in 2016. We will establish as
target before the end of the legislature, at least half of the citizens and
75% of companies can usually interact with the Administration
using only electronic means.

-

Further promote the development of social Internet, progress in eliminating
social, economic, geographic and gender digital divide, with the aim of
facilitate the inclusion of all citizens with equal opportunities to
Information Society and Knowledge.

-

Betting teleworking by developing a National Strategy for
Implementation of teleworking in companies and public administrations
including flexibility in schedules to reconcile work and family life.

-

Continue efforts for the implementation of Information Technology
and Communication on the NHS, so that
contribute to greater accessibility, use, effectiveness, efficiency and quality of service
and services such as electronic appointment, medical history and recipe
electronics (Online Health Program).

-

Promote the use of telemedicine in order to contribute to the reduction of
inequalities in access, especially in rural and isolated areas. In
coordination with the CCAA, develop the Health Portal involving
industry professionals, to meet the demand for information
we have quality citizens.

-

Extend the School Program 2.0 (implementation of technology in the classroom,
specific content creation, access to wi-fi network in the centers) to education
Secondary and Vocational Training. It will encourage the creation of
collaborative platforms among all those involved in the process
educational and training contents production.

-

Continue to promote the use of electronic ID by citizens and
Electronic invoice for companies, which will facilitate the safe use and
trusted network for purchases, management and all kinds of formalities Citizen
and companies with the Administration.

4.3 Technology
The year 2011 marked a turning point in science policy in Spain with
adoption of the Law on Science, Technology and Innovation, coinciding with the
XXV anniversary of the first law of science 1986. Today, as then, he has
again a socialist government which has launched this important
reform. We have done so because we trust our scientists and we know
the crucial role of research in our country project.
This new law opens new vistas, but also closes a cycle of two
socialist legislatures marked by an expansionary budget has improved
notably the situation of the Spanish science: in infrastructure (19
singular large installations), the number of dedicated researchers in R & D (36%
growth between 2004 and 2009), and international recognition (ninth
in the global ranking of scientific output).

- 24 -

a healthy and competitive economy


 

We raised four challenges for the next term 2012-2016: excellence; the
efficiency (through sector specialization and aggregation capacity), the
involvement and internationalization.
Our proposals to address these challenges are:
Excellence
-

Make a firm commitment to uniquely identify and support the
best research centers in Spain. The Government has already
up to that end the Severo Ochoa program in 2011, and along the
next legislature the best centers should gain autonomy and resources
to be approved with the best in the world.

-

Improve the current legal framework for private financing contributions
research centers and sponsorship of researchers to do more
attractive scientific patronage.

-

Establish a stable framework for developing new research career
under the new law, which provides more possibilities for good
researchers and includes instruments (such as contract researcher
distinguished) to attract and retain the best in Spain.

-

At the same time, implement a new autonomous and flexible organizational approach
a reorganization of the management of the stages of formation, absorption and
the researcher's career and technical research staff.

Efficiency
-

Better coordination centers to join forces and collaborate in
multidisciplinary projects. Spain has a scientific system size
medium, and to compete with the leading countries is essential to create masses
criticism in the public research system.

-

Carry out an intelligent reorganization of all public bodies
Research (OPI), based on a clear definition of roles and functions,
than
projected
internationally
our
leadership
sector.
We establish the principles for the organization and strengthening
institutions and public research organizations, guarantors of management,
financing and implementation of the Spanish Science and Technology Strategy.

-

The public R & D should be seen as inclusive of all
public actors, regardless of their administrative assignment, both
ministerial and the autonomous communities. Its governance must
based on the principles of a federal scheme, where sharing,
dialogue, co-responsibility and be predominant.

-

Start the State Investigation Agency, to respond to the
historical demand of the Spanish scientific community to reduce bureaucracy
and ensure greater stability in aid.

Implication
-

Spanish science engage with three major challenges facing the
European society as a whole (energy supply, climate change

- 25 -

a healthy and competitive economy


 

and aging population), they also represent an opportunity
for economic and social development. In the case of health and energy,
Spain are already in a good position to have achieved joint
the entire value chain, from basic research to innovation
Business.
-

Ensure that the regulations, the design of scientific institutions and
important part of the resources favoring public-private cooperation and
knowledge flows, to boost innovation processes and
enhance the different functions corresponding to a public system
R & D scientific and socially useful.

-

Implement the National Center for Aging Research,
created in 2011, whose design linked science, technological development and
social dimension.

Internationalization
-

Designing the future State Research Plan 2012-2015 so that the
national funding more efficiently stimulate collaboration between
researchers, teams and Spanish and international centers.

-

Advance research for development, as the Spanish policy
R & D and cooperation have not yet adequately exploited multiple
synergies between them. We professionalize and improve our
development aid, serving needs of countries requiring assistance
matter of knowledge and open new doors for the activity
researchers and companies.

4.4. Culture and digital content
Culture, in all its manifestations, has always been a powerful tool
social change. The inclusion of our commitments on culture within the
group of factors favoring economic change, in any case is to ignore
the value itself is the enjoyment of culture. For the Socialists, support
the diversity of artistic expression, the protection of cultural heritage,
commitment to democratize access of citizens to demonstrations
cultural, they are the responsibility of the authorities that go beyond
economic dimension. The profitability of a cultural policy is, above all
social.
However, we are convinced that culture has enormous potential for
generate economic wealth. The commodification of culture there is a threat
to fight, but this can not lead us to ignore the skills that culture has
to improve the material conditions of life of people.
Therefore, maintaining our commitment to the protection of cultural heritage and
reaffirming the defense of the rights of creators, the Socialists propose
a set of measures to increase the share of GDP of the
cultural and creative, to generate employment in industries; to promote
transformation of the cultural industries sector and the creation, access
all citizens to culture and creation; and to reaffirm the Spanish culture
as one of the great cultures of the world. We therefore propose:
- 26 -

a healthy and competitive economy

•

Reforming the current intellectual property framework to replace the digital canon
Current and set a new protection model, balancing rights
users and creators bearing in mind the European initiatives in this
matter.

•

Create an Intellectual Property Agency, with the participation of
Autonomous communities, to integrate into a single organism different
governance aspects of Intellectual Property.

•

Patronage Law reform to encourage private contributions to the
institutions and cultural initiatives. Among other measures it will match the
treatment given to the contributions made by individuals with
to be given to legal persons.

•

To promote the application of a reduced VAT rate of 4% to all formats
book, including the digital book.

•

Strengthening the Integral Plan to Support Cultural Industries and Creation,
with special emphasis on the training of entrepreneurs in the
internationalization, strengthening the business sector and the
financing facilities, with the end goal of driving change
business model required by the sector.

•

Creating entertainment software and video games, are part of the
culture of our country, it will take measures to enhance the
promotion, financing and internationalization of this important sector
economic and cultural.

•

Promote self-employment among artistic creators and creation
labor associations and cooperatives that bring together the entire value chain
the arts creation, production, distribution and exhibition.

•

libraries and museums will give priority to the development of workshops, residencies,
co-productions and all activities that facilitate the realization of
new projects.

•

Strengthen the synergies between the two sectors in which Spain is a world leader,
tourism and culture, with a specific line of promotion of tourism
culture, promoting diversity and quality of supply.

•

Reforming Heritage Act to accommodate new forms of
cultural heritage emerged in recent years, such as the heritage
intangible cultural, underwater or landscape.

•

Plan continue the renewal of the national museums and ownership

•

Agree with all of the book sector a viable plan to support
retail bookstores to guarantee the plurality of the editorial offering,
incorporating therein the digital offering.

•

Encourage and promote the film co-production film shooting
foreigners in Spain.

•

Promote Digitization Plan in cinemas
collaboration with the CCAA and the sector of the distribution and exhibition.

•

Improve funding, public and private film production.

A special reference to the Spanish language
Linguistic diversity is one of the greatest cultural treasures of Spain. For
Socialists, respect for this diversity from all levels of government
It has been and will remain an indispensable principle.
The role of government in Spain is fundamental to the defense of multilingualism
Statewide. Knowledge of the official languages ​​in bilingual territories
It makes the rights of citizens, their communication, their coexistence and
freedom are guaranteed. It is good that the Spaniards set of values
positively endorse and defend this wealth as their own. Investing in value
the other Spanish languages ​​is not an intangible investment: it is a gamble for
education, equal opportunities, social cohesion, welfare
personal and collective and mutual respect. Multilingualism addition also generates
economic value. Therefore, we declare the need to defend, protect and
promote educational systems of our country in the different Communities
Autonomous ensure that at the end of compulsory education our young
fully aware of both the Spanish language like other languages
coofficial, also Spanish.
One based on the inexhaustible raw material that is the knowledge economy must
consider language as a strategic asset of the first order. in this sense
It deserves special mention the ability of wealth that encloses the Castilian.
Soon, the world will have 500 million Spanish speakers, who will
distributed in many countries and on several continents. The Spanish, as
instrument of communication and cultural creation, has become, through the
cultural industries, a formidable source of economic development.
Since its inception 20 years ago, the Cervantes Institute has established itself as a
powerful agent of spreading the Spanish language and culture. The steady increase
the number of people who have obtained the Diploma of Spanish as a language
Foreign (DELE) is a good indicator of this magnificent work. We commit
diffuser to consolidate its role the Spanish culture and to maintain the momentum
outside the knowledge of the official languages ​​of the State and of cultures
in them is created.

5. Sustainability is a priority and an opportunity
Sustainability means durability: the opposite of short-term approach
who has based much of our economic growth from the 90's
scientific community has been warning for decades about the close
interdependence of the economic, social and ecological of
human action. Interdependence also linking the local to the global,
beyond any border, and that requires a new approach to the concepts
traditional progress and welfare.
The Socialists want to incorporate in our proposals decidedly one
sustainability approach to ensure sustainable and equitable progress, within and
outside our borders. It is necessary to strengthen the responsibility of
all citizens, making them aware of the (economic,
social and environmental) of their own behavior, as entrepreneurs, as
consumers, and members of public institutions.
We need as soon as possible measures to encourage the efficient use of all
resources (energy, water, raw materials, soil, etc.), including costs
associated with their consumption and degradation in the national accounts and the
prices, through adequate reorientation of taxation.
We can create more and better jobs, polluting less and making more use
responsible resource. Increasingly, technological solutions have
that allow us to consolidate the international leadership of researchers and
Spanish companies in very dynamic sectors linked to the fight against climate change
and the urgent climate change in the energy model.
In sustainability, there are several areas of action that can contribute
notably to improve our economy, because while correcting problems
They open new opportunities for job creation. These include:
-

Combat Climate Change

-

Biodiversity and coastal protection

-

Rural development, agriculture and fisheries

-

More efficient use of resources

5.1 Combating climate change
Spain is a very vulnerable to the effects of climate change country whose
major environmental problems will be exacerbated by it. The effects of
Climate change will be felt on the natural environment and its resources, and the
human health.
We need to strengthen the monitoring network of the climate system in order to
assess its magnitude and direction and better understand the effects of climate change,
contributing adequately monitoring global climate.
But climate change is also an engine of transformation
economic and productive models, capable of generating new areas of activity
compatible with economic, social and environmental sustainability, making it

- 29 -

a healthy and competitive economy


 

must give the necessary signals for regulatory frameworks and
integrated financial considerations medium and long term.
To do this, we propose:
-

Strengthening the capacity for observing the state of the territory, seas and
atmosphere, to improve the quality of public and private decisions.

-

Pass a Climate Change Act to establish the reduction path
CO2 targets for 2025 by dialing 2050, 2030 and 2040; integrating the obligation
to accompany the State Budget with budgets
carbon and incorporating the obligation to submit annual accounts estimate
ecological footprint in the commercial register.

-

Promote domestic projects to undertake quantifiable reductions
above levels that would require established law, and that these
reductions come into the scope of the fund to purchase credits
Carbon provisions of Law Sustainable Economy.

-

Promote a coordinated review of the planning instruments in those
Sectors considered most vulnerable in order to ensure adequate
integration of adaptation to climate change.

-

Consolidate the role of Spain as one of the key actors and reference
the global level, at the community level and promote a negotiating position
ambitious by the EU in international fora.

5.2 Biodiversity and coastal protection
Spain is one of the most biodiverse countries in Europe. However, each
year we accumulated debt greener, consuming and wasting our equity
natural, privatizing benefits provided by ecosystem services and
socializing for all the burdens and costs of repair or loss.
Our bet passes short and medium term by an efficient management of resources
natural. Sustainable management. Ultimately responsible management capable of
integrating the value of natural capital in the mainstreaming of all our policies.
Enter biodiversity as major component of sectoral policies,
from an economic point of view, it is not only desirable but necessary. From
Indeed, this is one of the conditions for the agriculture and fisheries sectors continue
receiving European funds.
The redefinition of agricultural and fisheries policies in the European Union offers
a great opportunity, more equitable, socially speaking, as are the
small farms, many of them in areas Natura, which
derive benefit from a greener CAP, recognizing the benefits to
community preservation and custody. According to the developed bases
this legislature, we must support a model of sustainable rural development
enhances job creation and reverse the depopulation of our rural areas.
We need to invest in biodiversity, and for this we propose:

- 30 -

a healthy and competitive economy


 

-

Develop and implement sector plans to ensure the effectiveness of the Strategic Plan
State Natural Heritage and Biodiversity in tourism, energy,
foreign trade, agriculture, fisheries, transport and water.

-

Approve a National Strategy to coordinate public actions and
spatial planning of all administrations, integrating
adaptation strategies to climate change and the enhancement of our
natural resources.

-

Strengthen the Natural Heritage Fund, so that it can accelerate
Specific management actions endangered species.

-

Develop and approve the conservation objectives and management plans
sites in the Natura 2000 network, giving prominence to citizens and their
organizations through environmental volunteering and land stewardship.

-

Establish effective and innovative control and management, as banks
habitat.

-

Develop strategies for control and eradication of invasive alien species.

-

Encourage sustainable forest management and certification.

-

Extend the period of performance of the Tree Planting Plan until
2020, to further increase the ability to capture CO2 and improving
Spanish non-wooded forest systems.

-

Prepare a Forest Information System on Climate Change,
together with the CCAA, it possible to identify the net balance
forestry in our country, taking into account both tree biomass
as biomass scrub, grassland and soil, for reviewing the
allocations to Spanish forests and promote better development of the sector
forest.

-

Develop a National Environmental Plan that integrates the risks Cartography
natural under the Land Law, and it would be desirable to have a
environmental thematic mapping, as a knowledge base document for a
proper planning.

Spain has a rich coastline that suffers great pressure that we must correct.
To improve their defense and promotion of valuation we propose:
-

Protect our coast, applying the Coastal Act, developing a national plan
Coast sustainability and promoting sustainable development and management
integrated coastal areas.

-

Renew our model for coastal management with a global vision
to consolidate the sustainable management of the same.

-

Definitely incorporate climate change as a fundamental variable in
our decision-making processes on the coast (research, management
coast, infrastructure, urban planning, etc.).

-

Adopt a strategy and contingency plans for natural risks on the coast.
The Spanish coast is likely to be affected by various risks (flood,
erosion, climate change, oil spills, etc.), although the

- 31 -


 

a healthy and competitive economy

Chance of other phenomena such as tsunamis is low, the areas most
likely to be affected have a high population density,
infrastructure and tourism, which raises considerably the
potential impacts.
-

Approve a network of marine protected areas and marine Natura 2000 network

5.3 Rural Development, Agriculture and Fisheries
Rural areas in our country represents 90% of the territory and 35% of the population, and
largely based on an agri-food sector that generates more than 1,200,000
jobs. In turn, welcomes the whole heritage of biodiversity richest of all
the European Union, and is constituted as a reservoir of natural resources
Renewable essential to ensure sustainable development of our
society.
The rural world as well as agriculture and fisheries, are facing the
new challenges of globalization, which give a new dimension to some problems
known and others who first burst on the international scene. The
global risks intersect with local problems and needs as country
overlap with those of the EU and its strategic relations with other countries and regions.
You need to identify the problems clearly, to design correctly the
responses and strategies to manage them. Employment is definitely our priority
action for the next four years, but quality jobs, stable and free
the increasingly pronounced threats of relocation.
Agriculture and fishing are of decisive importance in our system
productive, not only for employment and wealth generated, but because the structure
territory, population fixed, relocatable and are hardly constitute a reserve
essential for food security of our country raw materials.
Thus, in an emerging global scenario of new food needs, countries
They should implement strategies to nullify the risks posed by the
reliance on third parties in something that affects the most basic needs
population. The Socialists want this to be the basis of negotiation for
design of a new common agricultural policy in which Spain maintains
participation in the budget allocation has historically had.
To meet the challenges facing the rural world, agriculture, livestock and
Fishing:
-

In the European Union defend a strong Common Agricultural Policy (PAC)
contribute to the objectives of the Europe 2020 A simpler CAP, with a
sufficient and settled on three basic instruments funding: support
to income, market management and rural development.

-

We will increase the recognition and prestige of the sector's activities
primary. Professionals in this sector are graduates acquire true
their training in the same exercise activity, impossible to replace by a
formal academic training to use, but are not recognized its
professional knowledge in conditions similar to those of most
workers.
- 32 -

a healthy and competitive economy


 

-

We extend these model workers by professional qualification
exercise of the activity that the Socialists have been recognizing the
workers in some other sectors.

-

Promote economic structuring of the production sector, in particular
by cooperative integration, promoting a greater degree of concentration
enabling supply to better defend the income of producers in the
market.

-

We will continue to invest, as we have done in recent years to convert
fishing and agriculture in strategic sectors for development cooperation.

-

We will enable new instruments of control prices and markets
foods that help to prevent speculative movements and redistribute
equitable profit margins and boost frames
International regulation and control, transparent and effective.

-

We will link the concept of food quality, environmental quality. The
interdependence (agriculture-livestock-fishing) - (Biodiversity) and seal
guarantee for the consumer is a challenge faced by governments in
our country, to ensure the image of our sectors abroad, and avoid
food security problems.

-

In a global scenario of uncertainties, increasingly look is directed to the sea
as a reservoir of resources sufficient to supply the deficiencies
They may arise from poor management of land, but we
defend the errors that humanity committed on earth did not move to
the oceans. It should be clearly defined within the United Nations, a
universal concept of citizenship ocean preserve large areas
sea ​​outside the territorial waters.

-

The reform of the Common Fisheries Policy must be completed on
the same principles of the CAP, given the importance of maintaining a
strategic sector for the food supply in the European Union and the
wealth creation in coastal areas.

-

Efforts in the areas of innovation and applied research, attending
the opportunities offered by water management technologies, energy,
exploitation of fishery resources, aquaculture and various industries
and aware that the sea deposits are duplicated nautical activities
opportunities which in some cases have reached its zenith ground
use.

-

Efforts in the fight against illegal, unreported and
regulated to stop these fraudulent activities fleece
our seas, mainly acting on the marketing of products
illegal and updating effective control systems and the application of
Fishing sanctions.

-

Including Agricultural Organisations in the National Council
Climate, to have participation in decision-making in matters of
its competence.

- 33 -

a healthy and competitive economy


 

-

Promote energy efficiency and renewable energy use in industry
agro and irrigation schemes in our country as well as their adaptation to
emission standards to prevent the relocation of one of the activities
most important of our country.

-

Activate reforestation and sustainable forest management, to improve the situation of
our forests, reduce factors that increase the likelihood of fires, and
harmonize the use of forest resources with their ecological function.

-

Promote, by encouraging the use of biomass as an energy source
renewable and indigenous, transforming unused land in agriculture
Suitable for use for these purposes and the activation of the mechanisms under
the Sustainable Economy Act.

5.4 More efficient use of resources
In all our decisions, both production and consumption, should
always pursue the objective of maximum efficiency in the use of
means. On the one hand, this involves transforming production processes to achieve
the use of energy, water, materials, etc. is reduced to the minimum
quantities needed. On the other hand, the processes of packaging, packaging and
transportation are optimized to avoid the use of certain materials and
help reduce the amounts of waste.
The production efficiency, but also in consumption through utilization
rational of material goods and their suitability to actual needs, must be
one of our instruments to achieve greater sustainability. To do this, one must
promote the use of the goods, avoid behaviors "throwaway"
do not take into account the environmental costs of manufacturing the
products, and optimize the management of waste in all processes
production and consumption.
Water is one of the most important scarce natural resources
Spain. Therefore, it is crucial that one of the main policies of use
resource efficient is a coherent strategy to address availability
water resources and their rational use.
In recent years, the Socialist government has made major improvements
public water management and massive public investment in modernization
irrigation, construction of desalination plants, purification and
reuse and other infrastructure, which in the previous legislature allowed
overcome one of the most severe droughts suffered in Spain without any interruption in
the supply of drinking water supply.
In the field of water policy:
-

We convene all social, economic and political actors to reach
shared water policy in line with European directives, which
It must consider the construction of new infrastructure like last
-after option to value the savings, greater efficiency, reuse and
existentes- reassigning concessions if there were no viable alternatives,
considering economic and environmental cost. It is therefore to address
waterworks in Spain to focus much more selective than in the
- 3. 4 -

a healthy and competitive economy

past, according to the needs to contain public deficits, older
conservation requirements of our rivers, and the prospects for availabilities
future water resources accompanying diagnoses on
Climate change, promoting better use of existing infrastructure,
many underutilized by losses, lack of proper connections, or
by insufficient effective demand.
-

Approve all river basin management plans in order to
ensure, even in periods of drought, access to water quantity and quality
enough for all citizens, as well as maintenance
river ecosystems. To do take advantage of our leadership
Companies in all saving technologies, management, acquisition and processing of
water.

-

We develop a new water legislation, to update system
economic to encourage efficient water use and reduce pollution;
establish criteria to justify exceptions to the general principle of recovery
cost; promote integrated surface water and groundwater use;
enable the reallocation of water use concessions through
Public banks in each basin and consolidate architecture
shared responsibilities in keeping with the responsibilities of each of the
Administrations.

-

Saving and efficiency. In Spain there is still much scope for reducing the need
water, particularly in agriculture, where it can be further reduced
water consumption per hectare irrigated. Use is also needed
efficient use of resources available from the largest water reuse,
properly purified, technology currently no risk
for all purposes other than supply.

-

We reassign uses through public banks. The concession rights
Historic on water unused at present can be reallocated
to other uses by the Public Water Banks, who can now obtain
Resources for revocation of concessions for temporary purchase rights, or
allocation of resources bank releases the modernization of irrigation.

-

We will promote the full implementation of the Water Act 1985 on water
underground, through the registration of all existing wells prior to
the entry into force of that law, enhancing collaboration with users
the same.

In health and environment, we propose:
-

Create forum health and urban environment, an instrument of cooperation
with big cities to monitor the evolution of
main parameters of health and environmental quality in the urban environment (waste,
sanitation and water treatment, noise and air quality), accompanied by a new
tool, the national information system of air quality.

-

Establish an alert system and information on the presence and origin of
persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals and pesticides in blood,
promoting progressive reduction particularly in the food chain.

-

Adopt a National Plan for Chemical Hazards and Health Heavy Metal
including a timetable to ban the use of mercury, lead and cadmium,
and temporary measures until their complete disappearance.

On waste, our proposals are:
-

Effectively promote the recovery and recycling, as well as
Proximity treatments that prevent remote warehouses at
production.

-

Designing a new tax on waste generation.

-

Applying and developing the Waste Act, with special attention to the role of
shopping malls, chain management, so that is required to
suppliers to eliminate most of the packages and used
Packaging systems using renewable or reusable materials.

-

Implement a management model to reduce emissions from transmission
waste., that allows the 2020 management conduct
sustainable activity (biogas recovery, reducing emissions in the
transportation of waste, improved collection, minimizing rejection
landfill, etc.)

-

Encouraging the separate collection of biowaste by gradual support
municipalities committed to good governance and transformation.

-

Encourage energy use of biogas by developing
small units of mechanization on farms and in wastewater treatment plants
wastewater.

-

Activate a plan to boost soil decontamination.

6. New times, new energy
Energy is a key factor in our lives, and therefore is key seat
the basis of the energy model we want for the coming decades, with
into account the challenge of climate change, but also the needs and opportunities
in terms of employment, development of technologies and capacity building
exporter.
Our current energy model is characterized by a huge reliance on
fossil fuels coming from the outside up to 80%, which we
condemned to suffer from a permanent price swings in markets
international crude oil and natural gas.
On the contrary, our country has abundant natural resources that are
supply sources of renewable technologies (solar, wind, water, biomass,
etc). Given the foreseeable scenario of increasing global energy demand,
will generate tensions in fossil fuel markets, a firm commitment
renewable energy is a guarantee of continuous supply, with
independence from foreign markets, and compliance with our
commitments to reduce emissions.

- 36 -

a healthy and competitive economy


 

Spain has one of the most developed sectors of renewable energy and
dynamic in the world, in a leading position in production and innovation
technology. And, moreover, it is a sector with high potential
generation of stable jobs and distributed deployment in the territory, which
It contributes to rural development.
Speaking of the energy model of Spain, the discussion tends to focus
exclusively in the field of electrical, and often forget the
that, in terms of final energy, the sector of activity that consumes more
resources in our country is transportation. Therefore, our proposals in the area
energy focus on promoting the necessary changes not only in the sector
electric, but also in terms of sustainable mobility, which will develop
in the last section of this chapter.
Our firm commitment in this area is renewable energy. Because they provide
employment to the Spanish economy, innovation and technological developments themselves, and
increase our export capacity.
6.1 Betting on renewables
In the energy sector, we have significantly reduced our emissions
since 2004, breaking the upward trend of previous years. This has been
made possible by the significant improvement in our energy efficiency, with a
reduction in the past four years of 15% in our energy consumption
unit of GDP, the highest in the time series, and the strong growth of our
renewable electricity production has doubled since 2005, one of the largest
EU increases.
But we will still face challenges. Spain has a consumption
energy still well above the European average and a supply model
highly dependent on fossil fuel energy coming from the
outside.
The cost-price-rates constant equation has suffered distortions since
time causing, in turn, impact on consumers and a tariff deficit
evolving at an increasing rate. The commitment to ensuring access conditions
equity as an essential service is supposed to contemplate energy
most effective solutions to meet both the most vulnerable consumers
mainland to the needs of supply.
Promote the creation of a competitive industrial base in the so-called green economy
with significant export potential, internationalization and employment creation,
It is also an unavoidable commitment. As it is, likewise, reduce the presence
energy with a potential risk, albeit extraordinary foresight,
already known outside our borders, destructive examples of a range
universal.
Therefore, we propose a gradual and profound reform of the electricity market,
encourage efficiency and move towards the full use of our potential
renewable energy, reducing our foreign dependence. This reform should
reduce the tariff deficit in the terms established in the current legislation,

- 37 -


 

a healthy and competitive economy

eliminating unjustified costs and maximizing innovation,
It should gradually reduce the cost of renewable energy.
To do this, we will establish a stable support system for renewable energies
encourage innovation and allow the consolidation of those energies still under
development. In addition, we will promote electrical interconnections and generation
distributed, taking into account the specific situations of social vulnerability and
Geographic.
On energy, our citizens are proposed:
-

Preparation of a White Paper on Energy, addressing the whole sector
energy to analyze the challenges that our country faces, and raise
study different alternatives, and establish strategic guidelines for the
future of our energy model.

-

We will promote the right to energy generation, enabling any
person become a producer of electricity and to ensure the connection to the
transport network to sell surplus autoconsumidos not, and this
how to promote the democratization of energy and the progressive shift towards a
distributed generation model.

-

The expected increase in installed capacity by other technologies
generation, will allow a gradual horizon closing
nuclear power plants at the end of its useful life of 40 years, or sooner if examinations
technical detect circumstances that make it advisable to early closure.
From 2013-2028 the Spanish nuclear fleet is no longer in service.

-

Within that timeframe, the extensions will be released for a period
according to the age of the plant to ensure that fit
continually safety requirements.

-

In parallel, generating voids released by successive stops
reactors will be covered by renewable generation systems, clean coal
systems for clean combustion and CO2 capture with generation
manageable, providing the electrical system of the right tools (networks,
electric vehicles and hydraulic) pumps for integration in conditions
security.

-

Adoption of a law on Energy Saving and Efficiency, with particular emphasis on
the transport and housing, promoting effectively forms a
reducing consumption and therefore the energy intensity of the country,
lowering the cost in the trade balance and the ecological footprint of our
consumption.

-

A key energy saving is sustainable mobility, in which the
Public transport plays an essential role. In addition, the commitment to mobility
Sustainable has a decisive impact on the levels of contamination
cities. Therefore we will raise the requirement that cities devise and
Municipal put into effect sustainable mobility plans, and in reviews
its urban planning sustainability criteria are incorporated
environment in urban designs.

- 38 -

-

Approve a Law on Renewable Energy, which established the
objectives and is designed to achieve a stable regulatory framework for the development of
the various technologies with well-defined horizons in terms of increases
capacity.

-

This new Renewable Energy Law establish support mechanisms
public to the various renewable technologies for each can
recover their costs, according to scenarios incentive to go
reducing contributions in time according to the effective reduction
operating costs.

-

We will create a State Fund for the Support of Renewable Energy, which serves as
stability instrument mechanisms of public impetus to the development of
private investment.

-

We will promote R & D in new renewable technologies, with public support
phases of research and innovation in all renewable technologies, but
especially those who are in early stages more and can
have extensive backgrounds in Spain, such as cases of geothermal or
those who use the sea as an energy source.

-

We design a Strategic Plan for Biomass. Biomass is one of the
energy sources with enormous potential for Spain, for the many
positive effects it can bring to our country (rural jobs, benefits
environmental, preventing forest fires and pests, and technological developments
own).

-

We establish a charge on the already amortized mature technologies such as
hydroelectric and nuclear to renewable energy finance current.

-

We review the regulation of the electricity sector. To solve the deficit problem
rate is not enough to raise the electricity tariff, as has been done in
recent years, but that a thorough review is necessary also
of costs recognized by the regulation to businesses.

-

We will favor the acquisition of electrical appliances with lower power consumption.
As a reinforcement to the Plan Renove currently applying some regions,
We apply the most energy efficient appliances type
reduced VAT.

-

We establish a system of signals to identify time discrimination
peak and valley electricity demand periods, which encourages participation
active market demand, reducing consumption in the hours
tip and increased consumer valleys by storing
(Pumping and future technologies).

Housing: a more balanced sector a more protected citizens

The Socialist government has been working since 2004 to achieve a rebalancing
progressive real estate, reducing the large imbalances between housing
free and protected, purchase and rent, and between new development and rehabilitation received
a legacy of previous governments of the right.

- 39 -


 

a healthy and competitive economy

Our first priority has been to help the families, who especially suffered
the pressures of the first real estate boom, difficulties or inability to
access to housing, and after they have been affected by the crisis and problems
to meet the mortgage payments.
In the last two legislatures it has been invested in housing 50% more on average annually
the previous government. Adding the two State Plans, it has built 23%
more housing. Our clear commitment to public policy synthesizes
one fact: more than 80% of housing subsidies granted in Spain are
financed with state funds designed by this government.
Throughout these two terms have laid the foundation to diversify the sector
residential, favoring the Land Law of 2008 a balanced urbanism
put an end to speculation.
In addition, our government action has been aimed at boosting the rent,
ending the tax deduction for home purchase, except for lower income
24,000 euros, and approving deductions and subsidies for tenants and landlords,
and establishing the Basic Income Emancipation, which has enabled 300,000
emancipated youth.
We created the Public Rental to professionalize the industry and approved
a Law for the Promotion of Self that provides greater legal certainty. Also,
ICO has allocated 2,600 million euros to incorporate the rental market
housing stock that were built for sale.
We promote the rehabilitation and second fundamental axis for diversification
sector, making the State Plans and State Housing Plans
Rehabilitation containing direct payments, reducing the VAT to the actions of
rehabilitation and applying income tax deductions of up to 20% on the cost of the
works. As a result, rehabilitation today represents 20% of the sector's activity,
compared to 5.5% in 2004.
Promoting energy efficiency has been a mainstay of our commitment
rehabilitation and new construction, with the Solar Decathlon as the best ejemploy have incorporated as a key element in the modernization of the sector
real estate, another of our priorities, when we approved the Technical Code
Building, which promotes, in turn, R & D + i.
This modernization must occur in parallel to the development of a model
sustainable growth and downsizing of the sector, which in the first quarter
2011, accounted for 4.3% of GDP and 8% of employment and recovering a size
rational in the whole of the Spanish economy to return to 1995 levels,
before the creation of the housing bubble.
7.1 Sustainable housing
The financial crisis and the bursting of the property bubble marked and mark the
Guidelines housing policy in the second term and the next. He
focus new context requires housing policy not only as a right to a
basic necessity, but also from the point of view of an activity
economic to be transformed so that it becomes a larger value sector

added, which is capable of generating qualified employment, while contributing to a
more sustainable and efficient from an environmental point of view growth.
It is in this context becomes a total rehabilitation policy role, it
becomes one of the cornerstones of Housing and Rehabilitation Plan
2009-2012. Given that our country has been well below the
average EU-15 in terms of the weight of the total rehabilitation of the sector
construction (36% in EU15 compared to 25% in Spain, in 2009), and
our housing stock has a certain age (60% of the building stock
over 30 years according to the Population Census of Housing published by the INE
2001), rehabilitation appears as an activity with enormous potential.
However, rehabilitation alone can not sustain the whole sector
construction. While it is desirable that this sector again not hold weight as
predominant in our production structure, it is also true that the current
stoppage of construction activity can not endure over time. The
normalization of activity can not be achieved if not exited before the stock
existing housing, currently around the 700.00 figure housing, the
which correspond to a high proportion tourist homes. To this we must add
thousands of hectares of developed land or in the process of urbanization and soil
developable or reclassification process.
Avoid laying the foundations of another housing bubble, betting on harness
existing resources in the most efficient and sustainable manner and to boost access
to housing for the most vulnerable households with reasonable effort.
These principles permeate the cornerstones of the socialist proposal,
will be:
•

Rental policy and rehabilitation, and employment intensive activity
qualified, dragging the activity of related companies, incorporates new
technologies and commitment to energy efficiency.

•

The exit to the existing housing stock, through mainly the
rent.

•

Sustainable urban planning, limiting new growth only those
Where are truly justified and provided there are no other
resources and / or capable of being used by the
rehabilitation.

•

According to the regional governments to agree on policies
necessary to cope with serious existing problem in the sector,
affecting thousands of citizens, causing rising unemployment and restricts
the financing capacity of financial institutions to the private sector

Under these axes the following actions occur:
- New state housing schemes, rehabilitation and urban regeneration
•

- Measures to promote and mobilize rent existing housing stock
At this time in our country a stock of completed homes not
hovering sold 700,000 units, although its distribution is not uniform
throughout the country, but it is concentrated in certain environments
urban and mainly along the Mediterranean and Atlantic coast.
You need to address this stock and facilitate its market developing
rent. With this, what better allocation of resources mobilized favor
idle assets, while being able to shorten recovery
sector activity, essential for generating activity and employment in the
country.
The development of the rental market becomes a priority objective of the
housing policy for which the following measures were developed:
•

Enhancing the supply of rental through improved tools
collective investment in real estate (real estate investment trusts,
Real Estate Investment Companies and Investment Companies Listed in
real estate, etc.), giving them similar to other treatment
neighboring countries.

•

Coordination of the activities of the Public Rental State
with the Autonomous Communities.

- Promote an agreement with the Autonomous Communities in housing policy
The gravity of the situation of the sector and its implications in terms of unemployment,
funding and access difficulties for many families, it requires a joint effort
all competent authorities in the field of housing policies for
output the crisis.
Therefore, we will promote an agreement with the Autonomous Communities to enable
consensus and coordinate actions raised here on impulse to

sustainable urban development,
A Covenant with results also concertarían under the direction of State,
banks and companies.

7.2 Prevention and protection against over-indebtedness situations
individuals and foreclosures
Extreme situations caused by the crisis and, in particular, the plight
household indebtedness accordingly oblige the State to develop a
series of special measures that respond to these specific needs and,
in particular, rectify the shortcomings that have been revealed in
relationship with the credit system and our mortgage system.
-

More and better financial information.

The variety and complexity of financial products make it essential
develop basic financial literacy that enables users to take their
own decisions and not be exposed to the risk of investing and hiring what not
they understand. It is training to negotiate or renegotiate the terms of the needs
mortgage. Therefore, we will promote efforts to increase the culture
financial for the country and reach a broader segment of society, such as
portal "Finance for All" developed by the Ministry of Economy.

A new law on personal insolvency

We will develop a personal insolvency law that will regulate the balanced distribution of
risks between the debtor and the creditor, without penalizing the future credit
encareciéndolo or restricting it, and sufficiently ensuring legal certainty
in the trade.
Regarding our mortgage system, ensure the protection of
citizens, from the initial inception of the mortgage to the eventual
enforcement event, through the following actions:

-

Procedures agreement between debtor and creditor.

The modification of the mortgage legislation include procedures to promote
agreement between the debtor and the mortgagee before proceeding, if
default, the execution of the mortgage security measures such as:
•
Payment in favor balanced agreed between debtors
mortgage and financial institutions

•

or

Foreclosures should be the last resort because they generate
legal costs, delays imposed almost two years to the new office in
which interest accrues and housing is paralyzed, and when
arrives at the auction, the debtor can not obtain on their home worth
market that allows to minimize its load.

or

Therefore we incentivize payment in agreed as a solution more
efficient executions to benefit the mortgagor in good faith.

or

To facilitate these agreements involvement of all stakeholders will be asked
involved, particularly notaries and registrars, and promote a
general agreement with the CCAA to exempt the payment of tax
Property Transfer in cases where the financial institution accepts
the house to pay off the debt. This exemption would be subject to limits

Challenges for balanced territory

8.1 The territorial cohesion
In the last two legislatures, the Socialist government has resolutely supported the
territorial cohesion in Spain through special plans to promote activities
economic, implement investment actions and improve quality of life
the citizens. So, they can stand the Extremadura Plan, the Northwest Plan
(Salamanca, Zamora and León) or specific action plans for Soria, Teruel
and Jaén, all launched in the first term, we will continue
developed in the coming years and the Comprehensive Strategy for Community
Canarias Autonomous approved in 2009 and will run until 2020.
Also, following the earthquake of May 11, the government has made a great effort
to meet the needs of the municipality of Lorca, and continue
developing these proceedings until the full recovery of the area.
We will continue our commitment to a Spain with balanced territories,
well integrated and cohesive. We propose:
-

Continue the commitment to transform the center-periphery model networks
transport in a more structured pattern through transverse runners
allowing displacements by car, train and bus without
through the center of the country.

-

Promote the economic development of those territories with loss problems
population and lack of incentives for young people setting by plans
special comprehensive performance.

-

Promoting a model of orderly urban planning territory,
to harmonize the growth of medium-sized cities, a
integrated manner between urban development and the promotion of activities
economic trade and services.

Special conditions for their insularity and remoteness to the mainland, to
improve the quality of life of citizens living there and the structure of its
economy to the Canary Islands are our proposals
following:

- 47 -

a healthy and competitive economy

-

Promote at EU level in the next programming period
2013-2020, including the Canary Islands within regions that targets the
convergence and therefore provided the highest level of access to funds
Structural regardless of their level of income per capita.

-

Give continuity to the actions implemented in the framework of the Comprehensive Strategy
for the Canary Islands approved by the Socialist government, and CanariasEstado Conventions: waterworks, roads, transportation subsidy and passenger
goods, performances on the coast, educational and tourist infrastructure of
general interest, as well as the relevant funding schemes
employment.

-

Promote recycling activities, applying the
art technologies to minimize the environmental problems
on the islands cause residue buildup: changes in the landscape,
health hazard or pollution of natural resources.

-

Securing energy supplies at competitive prices in the islands, taking into
account in planning the circumstances of higher supply costs
and power generation.

-

The lower degree of accessibility of the islands to the services of interest
generally they are common to the other communities of the country,
causes a significant competitive disadvantage manifests itself uniquely in
the energy sector, a fact that we are committed to take into account
the next energy planning processes.

-

In this sense, we will promote the latest technologies in the field
energy in the Canary Islands. So, we apply a specific regime
photovoltaic facilities located in each of the islands.

-

Fostering policies Neighbourhood and wider neighborhood of the European Union, on the
framework for concerted action in Africa between the Governments of Spain and
Canary encouraging cooperation plans.

-

Canary empower the set of policy actions
EU integrated maritime.

-

Study the canary special tax regime (REF) to implement possible improvements.

As it regards the other insular region of Spain, the Islands
Balearics, although it is true that we have come a long way, especially in the latter
legislature, have a long way to compensate for own disadvantages
insularity. Therefore, we are committed socialists, as marks the Statute
Autonomy of the Balearic Islands, the Spanish Parliament approved the Law
Special regime, regardless of the regional financing system,
It will provide the necessary financial compensation to equal rights
the citizens of the Balearic Islands.
In addition, the Socialists from the government comply with what Spain is
provisions of the Statute of Autonomy of the Balearic Islands, in the sense that the
State shall ensure that any measure relating to economic and tax regime of the
island territories established within the framework of the EU, except those
you are excluded for reasons of ultra periphery applicable to the Balearic Islands.

8.2 Infrastructure and Transport Policy
In the last decade, Spain has gone from being a deficit country in infrastructure,
being one of the countries with the most extensive transport networks and advanced
Of Europe.
The main axes of our policy are: the commitment to the railroad,
creating a mesh network of highways to break with the center-radial pattern, and
modernizing and expanding the capacity of our ports and airports. In
the last three years, in addition to completing the investment efforts have been addressed
major structural reforms in the aviation, maritime and railway sector, for
improve the competitiveness and efficiency of our transport system.
The priority for the coming years will no longer continue to increase the size of
infrastructure networks, but to design a transport policy based on the
management, quality, competitiveness and environmental and economic sustainability.
In the case of rail, in addition to the above objectives, continue with
modernization of two important aspects of infrastructure: networks
urban and metropolitan level rating, to guarantee mobility
citizens, and for the transport of goods, an area to be
priority in the immediate future.
The selection and prioritization of actions, from its profitability and
social, it imposes itself more than ever as a means of work in the making process
decisions. It is therefore necessary to move forward in the use of instruments
economic analysis to decide the opportunity to carry out a new
infrastructure.
Furthermore, it is necessary that our transportation network guarantees a series of
competitive travel times throughout the territory in communications
long distance. Territorial cohesion should prioritize the timing and quality balance
service rather, a balanced provision of infrastructure.
Our transport policy proposals are:
-

The Socialists support a model that cohesione the meshed Spain
whole country. Therefore, the new and ambitious definition of Networks
TEN is an opportunity to make the second effort
modernizing the transport infrastructure system in our country and
fill gaps that still have, especially in traffic
rail freight. We support the inclusion and development of the five
large interconnected multimodal corridors: the Mediterranean Corridor, the
Central Corridor, the Atlantic Corridor, the Atlantic-Mediterranean Corridor and
Cantabrian-Mediterranean corridor. Five runners covering the whole
territory with a high-speed network for travelers, a freight network
interoperable with international ERTMS electrified and wide, with
the conclusion of a high-performance road network.

-

Completing the major roads and railways. Spain currently has
full implementation in a significant number of actions to complete the
Large structural axes of the transport system. The current framework

major projects, and formulas of public-private partnerships should be explored
which allow appropriate payment schedule for the amortization of the
infrastructure and with full guarantees of maintenance.

-

III. THE URGENT JOBS
Employment, the lack of it and its poor quality, is the main challenge we
we face. This was felt by citizens; so sorry the Socialists,
we should seek solutions from progressive principles.
Therefore, all the forces, energies, and policies must converge to recover the
intensity of job creation and start a rapid reduction in unemployment.
Unemployment today affects more than four million Spanish and Spanish, as
consequence of the deep recession that has hit the world economy since
the Great Depression of 29. A recession is a result of the worst financial crisis
Spain international and that matches the setting in the construction sector;
a setting that has led to a deterioration of employment than in the countries of
our environment. Seven out of ten jobs lost during the crisis belong
directly to the construction sector. This has been the main cause of loss
employment and unemployment rise.
The crisis in the construction sector had not occurred, unemployment in
Spain have grown less than half of what it has, Spain would
growing at a similar pace in the euro zone and, most importantly, it would create
employment in net terms. It is important to know the causes in their place
true scale, and to avoid errors in the solutions.
There are certainly other factors that have hindered the maintenance of
activity and therefore employment. On the one hand, the financial crisis and the consequent
credit crunch. On the other, the poor performance of some of the
labor institutions, regulations and management, they were very consolidated. The
limited effectiveness of public employment services to exercise effective work
intermediation, low efficiency to create jobs and maintain a system of
unselective bonuses and subsidies, the existence of the dismissal-express
(Introduced by the Popular Party in 2002) that it breaks with the principle of causality
the termination of contracts, have been good examples of this.
The legislature now ending has been marked by the situation
that all emergency-government, social partners, employers and
workers- placed the intense process of job destruction. Much
of reforms it has been agreed as part of a process of dialogue
Social intense is reached by a large Social and Economic Agreement
Government and social partners on matters such as pensions, active policies
employment and vocational training, collective bargaining reform, politics
Industrial, energy policy and R & D + i.
This agreement was not possible with the labor reform of 2010, which was adopted after two
years of negotiation. An amendment to the medium term aims to contribute to the
reducing unemployment, reduce the duality between permanent and temporary workers
that characterizes decades our labor market and increase
negotiated internal flexibility in companies, changing the pattern to make
business cycle adaptation can occur not through the destruction of
employment but by adapting working hours and working conditions.

urgent, employment


 

The new regulation of collective bargaining sought, likewise, increase
negotiated internal flexibility in companies, so that by agreement
achieved in collective agreements could have a greater capacity
adaptation to changes in the economic situation and labor partner.
At the same time we are committed to active employment policies, we have
renovated to adapt to the reality of the labor market and the characteristics of
territory; to increase their effectiveness in improving employability and
possibilities of insertion of unemployed people, especially young people and
long-term unemployed; to better meet the needs of companies
to cover their jobs; and to place employment services between
better tools for revitalization and activation of the unemployed.
For the first time in our recent history, the Government, with the support of agents
social, it has made decisions and taken courageous and difficult measures to
modernization of our production model and our welfare system.
Measures to transform and strengthen the functions of the Spanish state: from a
State protector and guarantor of freedom and well-being, a state also
dynamic, which creates the conditions to promote economic recovery and
job creation.
These bases mark the lines of what we do during the next
Legislature:
-

Continue the reforms initiated to contribute to a climate of
confidence in our growth potential and to recover as soon as possible the
job creation.

-

Formalize a commitment to young people and assume the obligation to mobilize
for training and employment through a shared social initiative.

-

Develop specific employment plans, both new sectors
traditional, to facilitate the transition to a more modern production model,
competitive and sustainable.

-

Strengthening entrepreneurship and the creation of new businesses and encourage
creating a larger business network.

1. Develop reforms to regain employment
In the last two legislatures the Government has focused its efforts on changing the
course of an inherited economic model was anchored in the construction and
underpinned by major structural imbalances. A model developed by the
Popular Party in the period of economic boom and the Socialist Party started
transformed since joining the government, with policies that got
during the first term to continue the path of economic growth and
boosting labor market. The Spanish economy was able to create in those years
the largest number of jobs of all developed countries, and took the rate
unemployment to the lowest levels of all the democratic period. During the
Second legislature drastically changed the context, the result of the economic crisis
more intense than has lived Spain. To mitigate the effects of this crisis the Government

- 53 -

urgent, employment


 

It adopted strong measures of public encouragement to the creation or maintenance
employment.
It has been a necessary effort, as more than 30,000 million euros annually
intended to unemployment benefits, to a rate of coverage
during this term, for the first time in our history, more than 80%
those who are unemployed.
If government action was characterized at first by giving answers to the
crisis, over the past year have adopted structural reforms in our market
labor, as performed in 2010. A reform that is called when the
Spanish economy reaches a level of growth generating employment, promoting
a healthy and efficient functioning of our labor market. For it is
necessary flexibility that companies need not obtained only through
realization of temporary contracts and layoffs, but with measures permitting
greater adaptability of wages, of the day, functions in posts
work and, by extension, to encourage companies to go without
reluctance to permanent contracts.
1.1 A great deal for employment
Employment is the great national problem. Employment is the best of causes
we can do ours. The use depends on all of the CCAA, unions
and workers, political parties, Parliament, the Executive. Is a
problem of all that depends on everyone. It demands unity.
While we're telling the world that we have to unite, not only a country
will overcome the crisis, we are making policies that are not unitary, which has
sense. In addition, the Spaniards know very well that when we joined
We have faced major problems.
Therefore, the Socialists pledge to call an Agreement for Employment,
all the CCAA, trade unions and employers and all forces
policies, to share objectives, to add, because it is our great common cause.
The national cause, which is the cause of the PSOE in the next legislature.
 
1.2 A labor policies aimed at boosting employment
-

We will place the active policies as one of our greatest priorities
increase employment opportunities, using the guidelines and objectives
enshrined in the Spanish Employment Strategy. From now on we must finish
the reform of the vocational training system, apply the new
contract for training and learning, encourage the involvement of large
companies in the process of formation of its auxiliary industries, and establish
conditions made for the program to contribute effectively to PREPARES
retraining of workers and unemployed workers.
It's necessary:
•

Custom design itineraries to improve professional qualifications and
job search for each unemployed person.

•

Build integrated system of vocational training, which will include the
all regulated vocational training and continuing education, in a process of
lifelong learning for workers.
- 54 -

-

•

Expand the supply of training, improve its quality and increase its
specialization, with the main objective of redirecting the unemployed
from the sectors and activities which have been a major adjustment
to emerging sectors. Furthermore, mechanisms should be created
coordination between the private sector and public services for the
training activities responsive to the needs of companies and
the unemployed.

•

Increasing training of workers and workers who are in
active in our business as one of the pillars that can generate more
Benefits to our labor market.

•

Encourage part-time employment by a new regulation
same, allowing unemployed workers Suphan active
during periods in which they were receiving their formation.

•

Increase the resources of the Public Employment Services, as we have
done during this term, and improve its effectiveness, and adopt new
instruments that do not exist today. Our commitment is to continue promoting the
State Public Employment Service and its effective coordination with the
Regional employment services, in addition to promoting best practices
public-private collaboration in the intermediation market

•

Improve the current relationship between active and passive policies, leading to a
more coherent and integrated model with greater coordination between
the Autonomous Communities and the Government of Spain.

•

Increase collaboration between public services and institutions
private involved in job placement, not to make
lose any job opportunity.

•

Further contribute to the support of the protection system

•

Maintaining the possibility of capitalizing unemployment benefits for
start a business on their own in order to overcome the
unemployed.

•

Find new ways of use of the provision by the person
unemployed to improve or enhance their employability, ward and
consent for public employment services, and in the framework of an itinerary
employability. Along with this, we must establish new ways of
stimulus to employment for unemployment benefit recipients without
that alter in any way their rights, and maintain conditions
adequate stimulus to employment for other unemployed.

We will strengthen the resources and mechanisms of action available on
employment policies by setting up a Fund for Employment
ensure the adequacy of resources as appropriate for them in the
next term and will underpin the extraordinary measures in favor of
employment proposed to address. Supplementary nature and will not replace

1.3 A new paradigm for the development of labor relations
- Reordenaremos aids recruitment for, besides directed to promote
the use of certain groups with special difficulties, tie them
directly with three objectives: first, priority contracts
implying an increase in employment in the enterprise; on the other, create bonuses
social security fees that are projected in time to change
ensure maintenance for several years of the contracts concluded with
help; and an ultimate goal: enabling and increasing training.
In this context renewed aid to the recruitment of groups with special
employment difficulties, do not forget to integration enterprises Centers
Special Employment and Social Initiative Cooperatives.
-

Our goal is and remains that can achieve greater stability
actual employment. The next legislature will be time to end the
unjustified temporality, which distorts the proper functioning of our
labor market and leads to permanent needs of companies
It is covered over and over with successive temporary contracts with the same or
different worker, eventually hurting the productivity of the economy
Spanish.
Consequently, it makes economic sense to discourage in any
the business cycle, excessive temporality. To achieve this and thereby
Real achieve greater job stability, you must continue to advance into the
policies to approximate the costs of permanent contracts and contracts
Temporary modulating unemployment contributions, so that both types
job better reflect the costs and revenues generated throughout the
system over the cycle. In the next term, we will introduce a new
unemployment contribution model, "bonus-malus" to discourage
excessive temporary, that unemployment will consider a quote
increased for temporary contracts and a reduction for contracts
undefined

-

We will increase the negotiated internal flexibility within companies. Reform
2010 labor reform and collective bargaining of 2011 have an objective
Common: increase internal flexibility within companies so that they can
have a greater ability to adapt to changes in the situation
economic and labor partner.
Our commitment to internal flexibility intended that these measures are used
usual and preferred manner relative to the external flexibility
end the massive use of temporary contracts (to its conclusion, when
improving the cycle; and his non-renewal, as the economic situation worsens) and

- 56 -

urgent, employment


 

Out with layoffs. Internal flexibility must be negotiated between the
company and the legal representatives of the workers, because we believe the
agreement and social consensus are the best guarantee to achieve balance between
flexibility and security.
For the new rules on collective bargaining and flexibility
Internal negotiated to deploy all its potential effects
positive in our labor market is desirable for organizations
business and trade unions to reach agreements within:
•

Promote a more orderly structure of collective bargaining

•

Modernize the contents of collective agreements

•

Strengthen the non-judicial procedures for resolving labor disputes,
to be renovated to make them more agile and effective.

Therefore, we will encourage the social partners, from the utmost respect of his
collective autonomy, to negotiate agreements within these
goals. And for that, we will offer all the support tools
we are required to form a system based on the solution
autonomous labor disputes, collective autonomy and the principles
legal security, fairness and maximum agility. The newly created Council
Labor Relations and Collective Bargaining can and should be part
suitable for this institution.
- Along the same lines we must identify new channels of participation
workers on strategic decisions in large companies, such
as that could affect its competitive position in the market or volume
job. These measures should be the result of a tripartite agreement between
the Government and the social partners.
- We will promote, with the social partners and other stakeholders,
greater use of part-time basis in our stable
country, which historically has never reached the levels that exist in other
countries of the European Union.
This should be based on a broad conception of the work on time
partial and not focused exclusively on the reform of labor legislation
regulates this type of contract, allowing a more equitable distribution of this
type of contract by gender, age and sector of activity.
Issues that will undoubtedly contribute to the extension of part-time work
stable are:
•

The possibility of its use in public administration.

•

Resources and infrastructure to care for children of 0-3
years and dependents, oriented balanced distribution between
women and men of family responsibilities, to increase
voluntary acceptance.

- 57 -

•

Of course, the always postponed improvement of social protection of labor
part-time and differences in treatment with respect to working hours
complete, that adversely affect the careers of contributions to the
Social and access to pension security.

•

It will also be necessary to introduce changes in labor regulation
part-time work, many times amended legislation, but
always without social consensus.

It is, therefore, a reform that gives way to a regulation that, so
balanced and once and for all, attend the same time the need for flexibility
and adaptability required by companies and the needs of stability,
safety and voluntariness required by the working people.
Finally, it will be addressed another of our unfinished in
relation to part-time work: regulation fijodiscontinuo contract work. Its regulation has long elements
uncertainty and insecurity for employers and employees to discourage their
use, although it might be in certain sectors one
good alternative stable employment against recruitment procedures
temporary.
-

Next to encouragement of part-time will be necessary to advance the
implementation of a policy of division of labor that takes into account among other
measures reducing overtime or establishment in
collective bargaining agreements that combine reduced hours
extraordinary with the recruitment of unemployed. This can help
driving down unemployment.

-

We will promote the acceptance of telework in sectors and jobs that
allow easily, without incurring a loss or waiver of the
and the rights of workers, or the feminization of teleworking for doing so
Compatible with housework and family care.

-

It is necessary to address a major global pact income, with industry participation
public and private sector, involving all stakeholders and in which
contemplate an evolution of incomes, prices and margins consistent with the
of the economy.
Companies and workers should place priority on promoting autonomously
the most appropriate policies to maintain and intended improvements
competitiveness and incomes towards investment and job creation. The
public authorities should accompany this effort with the implementation of
complementary in public areas such as taxation policies, housing or
power. This covenant of income should be incorporated into the Employment Agreement
economic and social agents, autonomous regions and political forces.

1.4 Equal Employment Opportunity
- Further work towards equal opportunities for women and
men to employment and working conditions. And that requires action

decided and promoted by the government to ensure equal
opportunities in all areas within the company.
- We pledge to revise the Organic Law for Effective Equality
Women and Men to see if the progress of employment equity
require legislative changes.
Public policies of affirmative action by the state should continue to play their
paper, but the new phase of progress on equality between women and men
is in the hands of new sectors driving the new model
production, where women will find more opportunities. Therefore, the
drive production model change also make a contribution to the
equal opportunities for women and men.
- We will promote the employment of persons older workers. Our
labor market more favorable long-related inequalities
Age: premature and unjust expulsion from the job of working people

comprehensive employment strategy for people older workers for
2012-2014.
We will allocate funding of active employment policies for people
older workers, among others, the resources derived from the compensation
spending on unemployment benefits by companies with benefits
make records of employment regulation to include workers
over 50 years.
- We will promote the employment of people at risk of social exclusion,
improving vocational training, employment opportunities and
participation in the labor market. These policies will continue on a sustained
partnership capable of generating synergies between public authorities, the
business and the third sector organizations with expertise in this
country.
- Maintain and improve the instruments of the hiring incentive
and maintaining employment for people with disabilities, both in the
ordinary and procurement company, as in the field of employment
protected, a generator engine jobs despite the crisis.
1.5 A labor institutions that protect and defend employment above
of everything
- Will approve a law of institutional participation. Organizations
business and trade unions play an absolutely key role in the
consolidation of our country as a social and democratic state of law.
They have always contributed to the functioning of our political, economic system and
Social from the recovery of democracy in Spain, in situations very
difficult economic crisis, like the present, and in times of expansion and
growth.
This law should proceed from the role constitutionally recognized organizations

economic and social which are their own, and to establish the legal framework for
participation of the social partners in consultative bodies, agencies and
public entities of the central government, tripartite and
equal, respecting the principles of objectivity and transparency.
- Reorganize the Inspectorate of Labour and Social Security, to suit
their exercise in areas of shared competence between the state and the
Autonomous communities. With a commitment to constant presence and relevant
in the public employment offer to be approved throughout the Legislature.
- The Inspectorate will be a key element for the success of another commitment for the next
Legislature: the outcrop, with rigor and will and continuing care, employment
submerged. Therefore, we propose increased surveillance and anti-
infringement and breach of the rights and working conditions because
Socialists advocate a guarantor status of mandatory
labor regulations in force in both the private and public sectors.
- We will promote the adoption of a second Spanish Security Strategy and
Health at Work, as long as there are accidents and diseases
Professionals can not express any satisfaction. However, we must
verify the advances that have occurred in recent years in preventing
labor and improving risk and safety and health at work thanks to the
increasing involvement of business organizations and trade unions, and government and
Autonomous Communities, through the application, with the consensus of
Public authorities and social partners, the first Strategy 2007-2012.
This second strategy will advance the quality of services provided by the
preventive institutions, supplement action and sectoral programs, territorial
and aimed at microenterprises to strengthen the participation of the partners
social and involvement of employers and workers. It will have to be provided
special attention to road safety work and new occupational hazards.
Also approve a law to assist those affected by the
accidents at work and occupational diseases, which address measures
counseling and legal assistance, support and complementary economic and social
those currently provided for in legislation.
2. Employment and young people: our commitment to the future
We must immediately put the employment of young people in the center of the
priorities of the economic recovery to avoid the risk that a whole
generation being affected.
The global economic crisis has highlighted the fragility of young people in the
Work market. Many young people left the education system to fill
insecure jobs, low-skilled and very fragile, bound to bubble
the construction. Moreover, the economic crisis has closed the doors of employment for
a high proportion of young people who hampered their access to a first job. More
a million and a half young people are now unemployed, and

difficulties of reintegration into the labor market due to their lack of qualifications
professional or lack of specific job offers.
We must conceive and promote personalized measures aimed at each of the
groups are such a heterogeneous group, but providing them with the necessary
internal coherence. We must offer different answers to different problems,
but pursuing a strategic goal: youth employment.
This is the objective of the Youth Employment Plan that we will adopt in the next
legislature, a plan that will include the necessary measures to reduce the high
youth unemployment and support job creation in the output quality from the crisis.
With actions aimed at:
-

More flexible education system to prevent young people from leaving without him
qualifications and training required for their personal and professional development.

-

Promote the return to the educational system of the younger unemployed on
all of those who left him without the basic qualification.

-

Provide a professional qualification accredited to all those young people
lack them, or they need to adapt.

-

Facilitate the transition to the labor market, through a first contract or
the development of self-employment projects, of those who have reached a
qualifications but lack experience.

All measures should be adopted with the participation of stakeholders
involved, particularly with business organizations and trade unions
the framework of social dialogue, and the competent regional governments in good
part of its execution.
The commitment to youth employment must be the whole society, and should
translated into a "social contribution" to fund the necessary measures
to reduce high youth unemployment, and support the creation of quality employment
at the exit of the crisis. This will require resources to allocate specific funding
Youth Employment program.
The Youth Employment Plan will include specific measures aimed at different
within groups of unemployed young people, depending on their age and
level of qualification achieved. The plan will consider measures aimed at least the
four large groups of young people:

especially in middle-level vocational training, where we will create

Our goal is to ensure that no student leaves the school system
until it reaches the necessary training and skills for development

3. Plans for the future employment in sectors and traditional sectors
Job creation must be based on a reorientation of our specialization

added. To this we must complete the adjustment of the construction sector
enhance the activities with higher value added services, strengthen
productivity manufacturing sectors and promote the implementation of ICT in
all sectors because of its enormous impact on the necessary gains
productivity.
Boosting certain strategic sectors of the Spanish economy will require
the development of specific employment plans for each sector, taking into
its features and needs, and put forward proposals for
boost activity in each.
Unable to establish a closed form a complete list of all
activities that may have in the future a strategic character for Spain. There are
technology sectors that are clearly identified by their potential
- 62 -

growth and export capacity, but with them the economic structure
Our country is supported by other traditional sectors that can innovate
processes, improve their competitiveness and increase their export capacity. They are
options, in each case, subject to developments in technology, the
territorial differences, the complexity of production processes and
subsequent investment requirements.
The government has already begun during the last legislature to take steps to design
an industrial policy with a medium-term horizon, and a coherent set of
measures that are contained in the Comprehensive Plan for Industrial Policy (NIP-2020), an
plan has already paved the way for the next decade. Our commitment to the future
means reinforcing some of the keys that should guide industrial policy
modern, based on measures that stimulate and accompany private investment,
and be selective in the more strategic sectors.
The key to designing a new industrial policy in Spain, in line with
strategy proposed at European level, are:
-

Innovation for the development of new technologies and new products.

-

Sustainability: the transition to a low carbon economy, to
the challenge of climate change, must be seen as an opportunity rather
that as a constraint to industrial policy.

-

Promotion of entrepreneurship, which enables the search for new
opportunities.

-

Improving competitiveness through policies that directly affect
costs and prices in the industry (energy policy, infrastructure,
communications, transport policy, etc.).

-

Internationalization, as industrial companies from any sector will
work increasingly in global markets, and therefore have to rush
modernization and access to foreign markets.

-

Specialization, since opportunities for Spanish industry will
located in very specific niche products, or participation in
production chains in the European or global level, where companies
success must be highly specialized.

In short, our program is committed to a preferential support to various sectors
strategic for the Spanish economy, which will be able to generate new
jobs over the next term, and to improve productivity and
competitiveness. To achieve this, we propose the following actions
aimed at strengthening the activities in each of the three types of sectors
we believe can contribute much value to our economy.
3.1 Sectors of the future
The most promising sectors for the Spanish economy are very different from each other.
In some cases these are sectors with high technological content and a
training requirements for highly qualified workers. In other cases,
are sectors that will provide goods and services that are in high demand
in the society of the future, and will help to promote social sustainability.

Although the list is not intended to be exhaustive, in the next legislature will propose the
development of specific employment plans for the following sectors: energy
renewable; Information and Communication Technologies; biotechnology industry
aerospace, eco-industries, agro-food, cultural industries and services
social.

Renewable energy
The renewables sector is one that is experiencing greater growth
year in all regions of the world, but especially in Europe where the EU
He is betting heavily on these energies. Along with Germany and Denmark
Spain is one of the leading countries in the field of renewable energies
Europe.
Four factors are contributing to strong deployment of industry
renewable energy in the world: (1) strong growth in energy consumption
worldwide; (2) the depletion of conventional energy resources; (3)
concern about climate change; and (4) the objective of reducing dependence
energy. Hence our commitment to this industry, a sector of the future, with great
innovative and exporting, and with great potential for employment creation capacity
in the next years.

Information and communications technology (ICT)
The broader ICT sector remains one of those that offer higher expectations
future growth. The Information Society is expanding
continuously in all areas of life, whether in the labor, services
public and personal life, which the ICT sector assigns a crucial role for its wide
mainstreaming. Hence, our commitment to promote this sector as generator
jobs in the next legislature.

Biotechnology

European average, both as applied scientific production, which marks the
development potential that can be achieved in the coming years

It is of crucial importance for their national definition. In case of

remarkable progress, there are still certain areas where action is needed

Aerospace industry
The Spanish aerospace industry has a leading position within Europe, and
It has special characteristics (strong export capacity, high investment
R & D, technology transfer potential to other sectors and the highly skilled

of employing labor) that make this sector has huge potential
future development.
To achieve the maximum development of the aerospace industry in Spain is
necessary to continue public support that the Government has been providing to
industry, and therefore in the next legislature will approve a plan for employment in the sector
aerospace.

Eco-industries
The broad sector of industrial activities that are included under the concept of "eco-industries" includes the following categories: pollution management,
production of goods and services directly associated with the protection of
natural resources indirectly related industries and environmentally.
In Spain this sector and occupies about half a million
workers, but has great potential for growth if measures are implemented
appropriate pulse. Especially important for their social relevance and
ability to create new jobs are water treatment, management
waste, the protection and improvement of forest areas, and agriculture and livestock
ecological.
Compared with other European countries the weight of eco-industries in Spain
much lower. This means that there is a large untapped potential and that this
sector can contribute in a major way to absorb labor little
qualified that it came from the construction sector as a result of the crisis.

Agribusiness
The industry foodstuff and drinks in Spain is one of the branches
most prominent activity of the manufacturing industry in terms of value
added production volume and employment. On the other hand, it is one of the
sectors contributing significantly to exports of our country.
The food industry is facing two challenges: the short-term is one of them

markets abroad.
The sector needs stimulus measures, which will be specified in an employment plan for
the entire food industry, to help overcome the difficulties
faced by enterprises and improve the operation of produccióntransporte-distribution chains.

Cultural industries

a factor labor intensive sector, the development represents a significant increase
quality jobs and a significant boost to the economy based on
knowledge. In addition, it is a sector with a creative component and
significant innovation, which directly and indirectly affects other sectors.

Social services
The social services sector, called white jobs, is very intensive
labor, and it is one that can further grow in the coming years. The
provision of social services is undergoing major changes and its weight in the
economy and its importance to society are continually growing. Two
fundamentally influence trends in this development: demographic change,
It leads to the existence of a higher percentage of elderly people with
their specific needs, and the increasing participation of women in the market
Working with changing traditional roles that entails.
Law Unit and the Plan Educa 0-3 are some of the main
instruments that will serve as a lever to expand and improve social rights
quality of life for families, seniors and children. With them, the employment plan for
all social services will boost a wide range of measures to
promote the creation of new jobs in this sector.
3.2 Sectors renewed
There are certain sectors that currently weigh heavily on our
production structure, and it is imperative to continue their activity
maintain employment they generate. But, simultaneously, it is required that these
sectors reorient their products and their production processes to achieve greater
sustainability.
In particular, we believe that in the coming years, three sectors
They will remain important drivers for the Spanish economy, but need
a profound reorientation towards greater sustainability to be part of
new production model:
•

Construction, which must be resized and pursuing new objectives, not
focused on the continued increase in new home park, but
rehabilitation and improvement of energy efficiency of the sector
residential.

•

Tourism, which must abandon the traditional model of quality supply
medium-low and low prices, and reinvent itself with new modes of supply,
to maintain their competitiveness and improve their sustainability.

•

Transportation, which must reach a more balanced modal split, to give a
more sustainable mobility demands strong response of people and
goods.

In the next legislature we will propose to develop specific plans for employment
these three sectors.

3.3 Traditional industrial sectors
Given its weight in the Spanish economy, its contribution to GDP and occupation
around half a million workers (direct jobs), pay
special attention to several traditional sectors in our industry. We propose
developing specific plans for these sectors, which should help solve
their main difficulties and implement measures to accompany your
adjust to the new reality of an increasingly competitive international environment.
While it is not generally in sectors with strong growth outlook
future, these industrial activities will maintain its importance in GDP
Spanish short and medium term, so it is necessary to provide support and care
from the state level.
Therefore, we propose the development of specific employment plans for
textile and clothing sectors; footwear and leather; ceramic and marble; automotive;
wood, furniture and cork; and toys.
4. Support for entrepreneurs to create more and better businesses
The recovery of activity and employment in the coming years will be
closely linked to the creation of new business projects and
self-employment and the growth of the broad fabric of existing SMEs. In this
recovery also will play a key role in the economy companies
social to the extent that are precursors and are committed to the new model
we want to encourage production in its triple economic, social dimension and
environmental.
Economic growth requires a new best companies, more and more
productive, able to satisfy busiest markets and higher
quality standards, dynamism and degree of internationalization. To obtain
these objectives changes in companies must address increasing
dimension, enhance professional management and seek internationalization.
During the last two legislatures have made a clear commitment to
entrepreneurs who overwhelmingly opt for self-employment, single
(Self-employment) or collective (cooperatives and worker-owned companies). We have
promoted the law governing the status of self, by ensuring
the first time the rights of self-employed workers, also approved the
first law at European level governing the provision for cessation of activity
freelancers. The social economy has a strong impetus for these
recent legislatures and although this matter is transferred to the Communities
Autonomous has approved a law governing cooperatives and European Law
Social economy.
Also in recent years our business has been favored with
fiscal, financial and administrative simplification measures, which aim has been
foster entrepreneurship, business growth, innovation,
internationalization and thus soften the effects of the economic crisis. Despite these
undeniable progress, we need to strengthen entrepreneurship and the creation of new
companies and encourage the creation of a larger business network.

urgent, employment


 

Spain currently has less entrepreneurial dynamism in the countries of
forefront of entrepreneurial subject, with rates of entrepreneurship
children and excessively fragmented production sector, with little presence
medium businesses and large and a low proportion of companies
innovative.
To correct this situation we must, first, encourage entrepreneurship,
as a key element of creating innovative business network and
competitive. The entrepreneur should be central to the progressive project,
because it is a reflection of individual freedom and at the same time is a sign of compliance
the principle of equal opportunities in economic matters. Therefore, we
We propose to raise the rate of business creation in Spain of 7% today to
reaching 10% for the main European economies; so that
each year more than 350,000 new companies are created, including companies
commercial and freelancers.
Secondly, it is essential to promote the growth of existing businesses.
Less than 20% of our businesses have more than 250 workers, while
In Germany over 40%. The larger companies can undertake
with greater assurance and effective investment processes, especially in
innovation and training required to compete in world markets and
generate more stable jobs and better quality jobs. Therefore, we
we propose that in the coming years 10,000 companies are currently
small size they become medium.
Thirdly, it is vital to support our companies in their internationalization, as
It is the engine of many of these growth processes. Our base
export business has expanded continuously in recent years.
We have about 39,000 exporting companies that take four years
placing their products abroad and more than 70,000 who do so
occasionally, but still far from European standards. Therefore, we propose
increase the number of regular exporters to 50,000 to
end of the legislature.
To do present a Business Promotion Act, with the following
contents:
- Facilitate and encourage the creation of new businesses.
- To support the growth of innovative young companies.
- Improve financing for SMEs.
- Reduce administrative burdens.
- Promote the consolidation and growth.
- To promote internationalization.
5. Promotion of the Social Economy
The Socialists are convinced that fosters entrepreneurship
economic and employment growth, but we also want that growth
translate into higher levels of well-being and social cohesion. Hence our commitment

firm in the promotion of the social economy, an important sector of our
economy that generates quality employment (nearly 2.5 million people are
linked directly or indirectly) with a high contribution to improving the
sustainability of our country as well as to social and territorial cohesion.
With the adoption of the Law on Social Economy in March 2011 we have tried to
provide a framework for recognition and stability to the activities of companies
social economy, to which must be added other important initiatives addressed by the
Government:
-

The Insertion Companies Act, which addresses the regulation of these companies
insertion with the aim of serving as an instrument for insertion of the
excluded sectors of society.

-

The Law of the European Cooperative Society established in Spain which allows
the intensification of transnational activities and cooperative societies,
in the case of large-scale Spanish cooperatives, its alliance with those of
other countries of the European Union.

-

In the area of ​​self-employment, we have recently legislated for on these
refer questions to the Council for the Promotion of Social Economy,
in addition to the Council for Self Employment.

The future of the social economy in our country is promising. There are potential
growth and generate jobs for many years to come. And we will
promote and assist in the next term as we have been doing up
now with the following measures:
-

Update the rules governing companies of the social economy in
order to improve their management and, in turn, principles and values ​​are strengthened
that characterize them. Specifically, the Act will be reformed labor companies.

-

Establish a favorable tax treatment for social economy enterprises
Business allocate surpluses for salaried workers

-

And also in the field of autonomous work groups will be enhanced
autonomous and professional.

Enhance the effective implementation of social clauses for access to
Tenders based on actual commitments of job creation,
local development, social cohesion, CSR, etc.

-

Create mechanisms for the Social Economy to participate in all
Administrations where public policies are designed.

Create mechanisms for permanent dialogue to participate in the development of
Reform Programmes, so that the Social Economy can contribute
effectively to make proposals and to contribute to the objectives that have been
Spain committed as a member state of the European Union.

-

formula of creating stable employment.

-

Establishment of a Monitoring Committee at the state level to organize
institutional participation of the sector in relation to specific calls for

communication, participation, dialogue.

-

Establish a clear and stable framework for relations between the public and private sectors
in the provision and development of services dependency care, especially
on the role that each party must have in development plans
infrastructure and services. Dependency Act provides for collaboration and
cooperation between the public and private sector, and in this context should facilitate
Social Economy Enterprises operating in the same as suppliers and
Service providers. Therefore it is proposed to include the development of clauses
contracts that allow the differential value of the Social Economy is taken
into account in public procurement processes.

-

Encourage the creation of "enterprises in practice." An important work
can make the public employment services is the dissemination of information
on profiles of people unemployed in different CCAA, which is
but it has not exploited. The possibility of creating pilot groups, especially
cooperative type, for creating one would require companies to combine profiles
Suitable work there in different AA CC and put them in contact with each other
(Very difficult from individual initiative) and the prospect of the economy
social, as a way of creating business, social and environmental fabric-
financially responsible.

6. Corporate social responsibility
To take advantage of the unique opportunity offered to us today that the
companies are allies of the objectives of the club, in the belief that
social responsibility (CSR) may be the right philosophical framework
the progressive involvement of companies in a project of a just society, and
as a central commitment to excellence and competitiveness in the globalization of
our companies, the State Council will claim the development of a
strategy for the promotion of CSR in our country that includes:
-

The extent to practice sustainable Memoirs of business and
standardization of systems of transparency. In particular, large
companies with more than 1,000 employees, will have to report annually to

Promoting Socially Responsible Investment, so that funds
investment and pension report annually on whether investments
perform are considered socially responsible criteria and, if so, they will
that report public and in the opposite case, inform why not have them in
account. The government will manage its investments and funds
through socially responsible criteria.

-

In awarding public sector contracts among several firms,
will value those who have accredited their status as companies socially
responsible as recommended by the State Council on CSR criteria.

IV. EQUALITY OF THE CENTURY IS EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES
1. The years of social progress
The construction and development of the welfare state has always been the priority
PSOE absolute. It was as the economic development was favorable when
We took the opportunity to expand; but also during the crisis, to preserve and
guarantee its future.
In these seven years, we have worked to improve the protection of people's
vulnerable. The Socialist government in 2011 invested 60% more in social policy
that the PP government in its last budget of 2004, around 70,000 million
euros.
So, we have increased the minimum wage by 40%, recovering
I ground lost during the PP; and we have increased the purchasing power
pension minor by 27%, reducing the poverty rate
old. The widow's pension with dependents has increased by 78%
with the socialist government.
In recent years we have strengthened crisis social protection to soften its
negative impact on the people who are suffering most. Thus, it has
increased unemployment benefit to older workers, women, to
cooperative and farm workers, and introduced a provision for cessation of
autonomous activity. In all, the coverage rate of benefit
Unemployment stands at 75% of the unemployed, well above the
60% had in 2004.
Socialist policies have also focused on developing education and
quality public health. It has doubled the budget for education and
increased health. More than 400,000 students by 2004 they had
means to study today have a scholarship. Electronic prescriptions, history
digital clinical and rationalization of consumption of medicines have improved
health services, reducing costs.
We have launched a new pillar of the welfare state, reference
International progress with System Promotion of Personal Autonomy and
Care Unit. Thanks to him today more than 700,000 people at
dependence did not have before any public aid and receive
service or benefit, and have generated 260,000 jobs in the sector since its
creation.
We have pioneered in Europe in the recognition of the rights of people
with disabilities, from the perspective of human rights enshrined in the
UN Convention, and developing it through laws and policies
concrete.
We have recovered the basic social function of housing policy. More than 1.5
millions of people have benefited from the resources allocated to it, which have been
doubled in recent years. We first created the Basic Income
Emancipation thanks to the 270,000 young people in our country can live today
independently.
- 72 -

equality of the XXI century is equal opportunity

 

We develop a genuine policy of reconciling work and family life. The
progressive introduction of nurseries with 3 program has led Educa
to full enrollment of 3-5 years and a 30% coverage of 0-2 years. It has been
first created in Spain paternity leave, which they have enjoyed
more than one million parents, and expanded maternity leave. Since 2004,
we have doubled the resources related to birth permits,
increasing them by more than € 1,000m.
We have also provided strong support for the important work of the organizations
non-profit and third sector of social action. Thus, it has increased
Personal Income Tax allocation from 0.5% to 0.7%, which has doubled the resources
from this path.
In short, the Socialists have made a firm commitment policy
social in recent years, even in the toughest economic period in our
recent history. The result of this, and despite the adjustments necessitated the crisis,
Spain now has a stronger welfare state and better than
had in 2004, which offers greater protection to the citizens and is more
prepared to meet the challenges of the medium and long term.
2. Axes of the social policy of the future
The world is undergoing profound changes. We have moved from an industrial economy
to a knowledge economy and services, increasingly it based on both
human capital. We watched in an irreversible globalization process,
economies and societies are becoming more open financial markets more
developed and how new emerging powers appear.
In this context, the Socialists have clear social project our future:
ensure equal opportunities. We want a society model
our country in which all citizens, regardless of the characteristics
family socioeconomic status, sex, sexual orientation, the
physical or mental abilities, ethnic background, are able to
live their lives freely, without more constraints than their own decisions
individual.
Our ambition strengthened their citizenship rights and their dignity in the face
the powers that limit real freedom and real equality difficult. Work
to achieve individual progress within a project of collective progress and
social cohesion because we know that there can be no development citizen released
without a common basis of equality. All this forces us to take a fresh look
the current challenges of the welfare state, and our future responses.

- 73 -


 

equality of the XXI century is equal opportunity

2.1 A social investment to generate economic growth and employment. Prepare
before repair
The first challenge we face in developing our social model without
doubt, economic growth and employment generation. It is not possible to sustain a
State social progress unless we have an economy that grows so
sustainable and that targets job creation; as it is not possible
the economy to grow sustainably without social and human development.
Today it is clearer than ever that the best investment in growth and jobs
future is social investment. The crisis has shown that the principle of the right
according to which any kind enough to promote economic growth
generate social welfare is invalid. Growth must be accompanied by policies
social ensuring that all citizens benefit from it equally. And should
based on continuous improvement of our human and social capital, the greatest wealth
future of societies.
The social policy of the future must be conceived and designed so as investment, not
as an expense. We want to "prepare" before "repair". We prefer to provide resources and
opportunities to individuals rather than let market, with its unfair allocation
Initial resources and opportunities to operate freely and then compensate
losers.
Our social program therefore links the maintenance of protection policies
and developing new activation policies. To achieve our goals
we have to balance the static perspective, which merely alleviate the difficulties
present in individuals or to keep the lost revenue with a
renewed dynamic perspective, thinking social problems in terms of
vital, and future career.
The welfare state we want is a system with a strong dimension
activator. That is, facing preventive social investments that minimize
future claims and to train citizens. Both approaches not only
They are compatible but also are absolutely necessary. Without policies
ensure income and resources to those in difficulty, will not be effective or
Possible activation policies. But protection policies will not
- 74 -

equality of the XXI century is equal opportunity

 

possible without this approach to social policy as a driver for competitiveness and
productivity.
2.2 A social policy adapted to the reality of people. Responding to
all dimensions of equality
Today, new gaps of inequality that do not always fit the traditional
social and labor dimension or income. In this increasingly complex society,
diversified and fragmented, training deficiencies, the digital divide, loads
family, emancipation issues, immigration and the underground economy
together with unemployment, job insecurity or lack of personal autonomy
barriers to consider in the design of our welfare policies.
Also, as has happened in most developed economies in the
recent years in our country there has been an increase in income inequality
as a result of the crisis. Therefore, for reasons of equity and efficiency
our social and economic model, we must improve the elements of pre- and income redistribution, particularly through a more equitable distribution of
tax burden, with a significantly higher contribution of very high incomes.
In parallel, we need to manage increasingly diverse societies. Companies
very pluralistic, which have interests and heterogeneous values, living situations
work, personal and very different family and where there is growing
variety of roles.
Improve the efficiency and equity of our Welfare State if we adapt
public services to the real needs of people. It is a requirement
effectiveness since, given the growing wealth and social complexity, policies are needed
adapted to the particular situation of individuals, to encourage proper
development of their individual abilities. Therefore, public services should
tend to be more and more personalized and flexible.
2.3 The new equal opportunities. We define what we do not
Where we come from
Equal opportunity means ensuring that talent, creativity,
work and effort of all worth the same, and contribute equally to the development
common. This new way of defining social policy is possible only when
our young people face life with the same opportunities regardless of their
social status, their gender, their ethnicity, or any other condition. From
Similarly, all human beings have a right to our health,
protection of our life against disease or accident in the same
conditions, regardless of our economic possibilities.
Only a universal, free and high quality public services can
realize these basic rights. Only the left, only the Socialists, the PSOE
in Spain, real driver and constructor of the welfare state that we have,
can ensure their sustainability, ie, maintain, strengthen and
future development. And we will not reduce social spending, seeking new formulas
public funding and implementing measures to generate greater efficiency
resource.

- 75 -


 

equality of the XXI century is equal opportunity

2.4 A future social policy, and future. Management and service delivery
efficient and rational use
In critical situations like the one now facing, the social sensitivity
It characterizes the left is more necessary than ever. Social investment must
be financially sustainable in times of crisis. But unlike the right,
Socialists are committed to sustain us great public services
social protection and defend a progressive and fair view of the two great
equality rights that make up the Social State and Welfare: education and
health.
Improving the financial sustainability of social policy goes for us
ensure better management and operation of our public services, and use
rational and appropriate for them, and not their elimination. Social policy must be
in this sense a strictly efficient policy. Public services must
apply creativity and rigor in management improvements that maximize efficiency
delivery and quality assurance. To this end, improve the governance of organizations
public is essential.
Also, the objective of equity required to prevent and deal with any abuse or
fraudulent social services, undermining the legitimacy of their own
social policies.
2.5 An equal in rights and social policy coordination between regions. Same
rights for all, and closer
Combating inequality social policy also involves meeting the
strengthening inter-regional inequalities territorial cohesion. in the matter of
social policy, the competencies lie in the level of government more effectively
You can manage them, which has generated significant benefits in terms of
proximity and quality. But for the system to function properly we need
that there is full cooperation between the three levels of government and different
local authorities.
Therefore, an important corner of our social program is the promotion of the
intergovernmental cooperation and coordination between national, regional levels and
Local and between territories. We need concerted action at all levels to
effective programs and effective rights. Furthermore, it is necessary to demolish
territorial barriers to ensure full mobility between social services
all state territory, establishing common information systems with
indicators comparable targets that provide transparency on results, and
eliminating duplications that are wasteful. We also need to develop
catalogs of rights and duties that define common services standards
quality and relevant evaluation indicators for Communities
autonomous.
3. Education today, opportunities of tomorrow
Education is not an expense but an investment to generate future unwaivable
economic development and social welfare.

- 76 -

equality of the XXI century is equal opportunity

 

Educational policy has been and will always be a priority for socialists
constitute the first factor of both individual and collective progress and establish itself as the
essential piece of equal opportunities. We have promoted the model that has
guaranteed equality and universalization of our educational system. The quality
education for all be achieved on the basis of a comprehensive project
plural rotation about the public school of excellence. Training also
promote the exercise of responsible citizenship.
The future of society depends on education, by its nature and equalizer
strategic importance to the accumulation of human capital is vital for the
growth in the framework of a modern, innovative and competitive economy. For
reorient our model of economic growth, increase competitiveness and
the productivity of our businesses is essential to raise the level of training
of all citizens, which will allow more options for access to employment.
The socialist educational proposal is based on the values ​​of equality, inclusion,
socialization, as well as merit, effort, excellence and promote talent.
3.1 Our commitment: more and better investments in education
At the beginning of the legislature, the government presented in Parliament the objectives
education for the next decade as part of Europe 2020, along
with a financial report for compliance. The Government will propose to the
regions, within the framework of the Sectorial Conference of Education,
territorial cooperation programs and the priority actions for achieving
such objectives. At the same time, evaluation and rationality encourage the use
available resources to obtain maximum performance.
3.2 Extension of educational opportunities at different stages of life
Early childhood education is fundamental to offset inequalities
starting and helps improve later school success. To further advance
In order to guarantee a public square in childhood education 0-3 years all
families who need it, in the next legislature will continue extension
the same.
We encourage coeducation. Sexism and violent behaviors
learn from childhood so that the target population for equal work
It should be children and the socializing institutions par excellence and school
families. Training and awareness of these agents is key to children
grow in values ​​of tolerance, equality and respect. To achieve necessary
ensure that there is no separation between boys and girls at all centers
funded public funds.
The new demands of society require further offers for adults
want to join the training process throughout life. Because,
will increase the seats in the different levels of compulsory education,
especially in middle-level vocational training, where we will create 200,000
new places. Our goal is to ensure that no student leaves the system
education until it reaches the necessary training and skills for development
personal and professional. We will also increase the availability of training aimed

equality of the XXI century is equal opportunity

especially for young people who left the education system without any
professional qualification.
At university level we will make a plan to restructure the offer
academic, especially in masters, in accordance with the public interest and strength
economic and human resources of each institution. We will promote the provision of
flexible education programs that allow to combine study with work.
Additionally, we will promote the training offer adult education and
University for seniors.
3.3 The best teachers for an education system in continuous process
gets better
We want to attract the best professionals to what needs to be improved
initial training, recruitment processes, training in practice and establish a
career model that recognizes the greater involvement in improving
results of students.
We evaluate the performance and results of the new kindergarten and primary grades
Master and secondary to fit the skills relevant to the
teachers in different educational stages.
We establish a new system of access to the performance of the profession
MIR similar characteristics to existing healthcare model that considers the
Overcoming some tests in which scientific knowledge crediting and
Teaching specialty which is chosen, two years of practical training and theoretical

a final evaluation in which the training received is contrast. Therefore, the
new system of access to public teaching will include a training phase
General training and teaching practice phase, two-year
paid, which will conclude with the award of the title of specialist.
The evaluation system will identify the best teachers, which will be
encouraged to join the support group of teachers, from which
They perform tasks of guidance and counseling in schools with the highest
school failure, and coordinates the operation of reinforcement classrooms
these centers and participate in the design and delivery of training programs
permanent teachers.
We establish a career model that values ​​the work done in
centers, taking as reference the fundamental development of actions and
innovation projects and educational research to promote improved
academic achievement of all students. This model should encourage and motivate
teachers and increase their social prestige.
Reinforce the initial training of the candidates for the leadership of the centers,
designing a new training program within the framework of the Sectoral Conference
Education, and with the participation of experienced managers.
Also we reinforce the ongoing formation of the directors in office
to contribute to the better functioning of schools and improvement of
academic performance of students.

3.4 Educational Success of all students
Each student must be able to fully develop their potential. The
improving student achievement and combating early school leavers should
approached from the perspective of prevention in the early years of schooling,
strengthening and enhancing early childhood development and early intervention within the
first cycle of infant education. To that end we establish, under
agreements with the Autonomous Communities, the program contracts
centers set specific goals to improve performance in both rates
school success and continuity in the further education. The
program contracts should make explicit commitments to improve centers
their results and the resources to be provided administrations. We will promote the
Real autonomy of schools so that they can achieve improvement goals
under specific program contracts and shall involve the Communities
Autonomous in their development through appropriate agreements.
Gradually extend the range of activities of reinforcement (the
BOW universal Plan) to all public and Primary Schools
the schools providing the first years of compulsory secondary education.
These hours will focus particularly on strengthening language, mathematics and English
in order to give all students the basic skills necessary for
successful completion of compulsory education. Also they will be offered simultaneously
deepening activities aimed at students with greater motivation to
to learn. teachers will be hired to provide much needed hours
strengthening and deepening.
At the end of the legislature all centers 5h be offered in the evenings, assistance
voluntary for students, aimed at both students with major difficulties
learning as students with greater capacity and motivation to learn.
The network of centers supported with public funds is the instrument which we have
equipped to implement the principle of free and compulsory education to
16 years. Therefore, all schools supported with public funds, public and
subsidized private, they should have the same rights and the same obligations
so they must meet the following requirements:
---
---
---

Ensure a balanced education for all students with special
learning difficulties.
Effectively ensure the principle of gratuity for families
Conduct a transparent and controllable management socially

Educate all together, is a general principle which must meet all
centers supported by public funds, for the defense of the right of families to
choose schools for their children in any way it can turn on the right
centers to choose their students.
Textbooks are a necessary tool for ensuring education
universal, so the Socialists defend the gratuity of this material through the
basic education. In parallel, the creation and access to content will be promoted
Digital through Internet.

All young people who finish compulsory education without obtaining title
receive a graduate certificate level will indicate acquisition of
basic skills. Education authorities will be offered training
requiring supplementary to obtain title through
evidence.
They allow high school students curse and flexible mode
subjects by supplementing the number of years required, according to their
possibilities.
3.5 decisive impetus to learning English
Knowledge of English is crucial in improving employability and
productivity in a globalized society, and immersed in a process of reforms
to address the structural development of a new economic model and
productive. The language proficiency longer add value to become
an essential to address economic, social needs and challenges
education in our country.
The constant improvement of English requires additional important effort by the
Government in coordination with the autonomous communities, ranging from the
Initial teacher education in the coming years will enter in the system
education, language proficiency upgrading of staff teaching
currently teaching, creating appropriate contexts to provide the population
adult language learning, generalization of the mobility of teachers and
students in Europe and the awareness of society at large about the
need for these lessons.
The ultimate goal is to improve the competence of the population in English and Spanish
ensure that all students at the end reach a post-compulsory education
domain level at least equivalent to B-1 of the Common European Framework
for languages ​​developed by the Council of Europe. For that:
-

The presence of native teachers will increase by each public center
primary, and Spanish teachers exchange with foreign institutions.
Similarly, the number of assistants in schools
was financed by the Ministry of Education will increase from current 3,000 to 10,000

In addition, to enable access to the labor market, generate flows of knowledge
by interacting with the socio-economic environment and the ability to respond to
innovation needs of the productive sectors. In turn, they must be
internationally competitive and be at the outposts in

4. Health is key to equality
4.1 Public health: an achievement to defend
Health is a key factor in the fight against inequality. Coverage
risks that are related to health for all citizens,
regardless of their origin and situation, it is essential for the full development
our capabilities. Greater coverage of health risks for those
they have higher incomes, as with insurance-based systems
private, starting reinforces inequalities throughout life by conditioning
success in education, access to the labor market, and therefore the level of income,
everybody.
Therefore, and for decades, the Socialists have worked to develop a
public, universal, free and quality health system. So, we must not forget that
the health system financed by taxes that we enjoy today is born by
socialist impulse, with the approval of the General Health Law in 1986. From
2004 investment in health has increased by 20%, and there has been progress
important in the equity, efficiency and sustainability of the system. For example, with
guarantee universal right to public health to all citizens
It has been established in the new Public Health Act passed in
September 2011 by the Socialist government, with the boost in investment in
new technologies, or reduce the pharmaceutical expenditure.
Thanks to this common effort, our health system is today one of the most
equitable and efficient in the world. The Spanish healthcare system is one that
They have better health outcomes between developed countries by all
international comparisons. Life expectancy at birth in Spain is now a
of the highest in the world, well above the European average. Likewise the
Life expectancy has increased in Spain to 81.58 in 2009, and the mortality rate
Children descended from 3.8 to 3.5 between 2006 and 2010, placing again for
above the European average set at 4.6. In addition, our recent
investments in technologies have made us pioneers in Europe in the
Online implementation of Health (health card, electronic prescriptions and history
digital).
Also as a result of that work, health is a strategic sector in the
Spanish economy. The health system has a high added value and many
positive externalities. So, it is one of the more productive sectors
dynamic and create jobs in the country with 1.2 million jobs, and a large
economic support in leading sectors like R & D + i biomedical. Also plays
an enabling role of territorial articulation and establishment of the population in the
rural areas.

equality of the XXI century is equal opportunity

However, there is still much room for improvement of health services and
health policies in Spain. First, to further improve the quality
services, with users and professionals in the center; in second place,
to properly adapt to the new realities, namely the progressive
aging population and the increasing incidence of diseases
chronicles, which today account for 39% of the total and consume 70% of the resources
aimed at healing; and thirdly to better respond to the needs of
funding system, ensuring the adequacy of resources, improving efficiency
and transparency in management, and rationalizing the use of health services.
4.2 The future of health policy for socialists: new challenges, better
solutions
To respond to new challenges, make better solutions lack. For the
Socialists the answer is not in the health copayment, we reject. Is
shown in other countries than the copayment may result in health inequalities
equity break, especially affecting the population with more layers
needs. Also, it does not generate sufficient funding needed by the system,
or act as a modulator element of demand by not discriminating among them
They make improper use of the system of those who need it.
Socialists work on improving health policies to achieve four
goals:
-

A system that puts in the center users and their needs, and
much higher quality, more transparent and more participation; so what
more involved professionals, rewarding good results.

-

A system adapted to the new realities in health, as
aging population and a higher incidence of chronic diseases.

-

A system focused on prevention and query filter for improved
effectiveness in health outcomes, with the promotion of sport as an element
Central.

-

We will design strategies for coordination between social and health sectors,
studying embedded systems that have already been launched in other
European countries, and centralize the system input chronic patients

chronic patients and the establishment of a system of specialized care
for them, and improving the effectiveness of general services, overloaded
sometimes by the increasing incidence of chronic diseases.

-

We will move from a model focused on acute attention to another process
centered chronicity.

-

We will strengthen and improve primary care, which focuses the

public works, transportation and occupational health.

-

We study special measures for groups whose needs are not
adequately served by the system. Thus, the inclusion of such benefits
social security psychological care to patients of diseases
chronic and cancer in certain cases, or the incorporation of certain
no substance addictions that have a significant effect on health, as
game, the General Plan on Drugs.

-

We reiterate the commitment of the PSOE with HIV prevention policies, with
special effort in those population sectors most exposed to HIV and the
Early diagnosis of infection. We will ensure the quality of care
to ensure the health and treatment of people with HIV and AIDS,

Drug addiction. Serious drug problems who lived society

highlights by socialist governments. But the fact that the
relatively controlled consumption and its consequences are especially
now it does not mean they are gone. A wide care network
public and state resources through NGOs dealing effectively giving
appropriate responses to problems and develop prevention programs
with very positive evaluations. This network should not suffer any cuts so
prevent old and dramatic problems of the past resurface again, but
we must also maintain institutional vigilance to avoid the threat of
new drugs and new consumption habits especially related
chemical substances. Support research and provide appropriate information to
professionals about new risks as they emerge.
In any case, for the Socialists, the priority for the coming years refers to
alcohol consumption by minors. The signing of the "National Agreement against
Liquor consumption by minors "which has allowed for
first agreement institutions and NGOs, social partners, industry and
distributors, frames the most important goal of the Legislature.
While it is essential to improve the regulation of each and every one of the
drugs, I tried to minimize, from the perspective of harm reduction, the
negative consequences of its consumption, facilitating the practical measures
allow citizens access to credible information smoothly to avoid
risk behaviors.
- Sport. The last few years have meant an extraordinary development of sport
in Spain. Certainly in the field of professional sports and the consolidation
of our country as a sports power. The effort made in infrastructure,
media and training is bearing results and we need to continue it,
strengthening the system and the sports structure by promoting the
Private and modernization programs and collaboration of public funding
and through the adoption of a law professional sport, focusing on
regulation of management models sporting character entities
professional, and the development of the Athlete Assistance Program, which
emphasizes the importance of developing complementary professional careers
sports.
However, the development of professional sports only makes sense from the
public as an element of international projection of Spain, but above all,
as an excellent instrument for promoting access of citizens to the
sport as a fundamental element of the development of personality,
central aspect of proper public health policy and also in all key
social integration policy. Therefore, the fundamental element of a policy
Sport is promoting the spread of sport and its full
integration into society. We should promote that sport is an activity
ordinary for all people and all ages, progress in implementing
the Comprehensive Plan for the Promotion of Physical Activity and Sport, adopted in
this Legislature and deepen the social significance of sport. By
all of it:

5. Families engine of social transformation
5.1 In all families, the social and economic prosperity
Families are the main structuring and transformative element of our
society. In Spanish history, the family has played a decisive role in the
social sphere. As a leading provider of education, health and social protection, is

- 93 -


 

equality of the XXI century is equal opportunity

therefore also crucial in moving towards effective equality of
opportunities in our country.
Thus there is a causal relationship between the level of benefits for family and
children and child poverty rates in the OECD countries. On the other hand,
various international studies show a clear correlation between aid
Direct families and number of children.
As a society, Spanish families have evolved, operating at the same
time as the engine of progress and social and economic prosperity. Today there
many family types, with different needs, which must be
properly recognized and met to ensure social cohesion and
balanced prosperity.
The Socialists have always recognized the important role of families, and we
worked to meet their needs. During the last two legislatures have
increased public spending on families, which has resulted in
improvements in social protection and taxation. We also have generalized measures
family support with the creation of new paternity leave, and
flexibility and adaptation of days for family reasons and conciliation, and
focus on the (large families, single or most vulnerable families
incapacity of the mother). Furthermore, it has progressively expanded rate
care coverage for early childhood (0-3 years) to reach 31% in 2010
of children under three years, exceeding the target set by the EU for 2010 (33%).
One of the most important advances in this area was the approval of Law
Personal Autonomy and Care for Dependent People. With
it is achieved to extend the right to public attention to all those people
they can not help themselves. A social and economic advancement of the first order,
which not only creates a new right, but also represents an important space
job creation and innovation towards the development of a new system
productive. The law has enabled more than 738,000 people are addressed,
receiving more than 900,000 benefits. He has also been an important niche
employment, with over 260,000 new registrations in social security.
It has also been materialized in recent years the socialist commitment
guaranteeing the right to housing. The Socialist government has been working since
2004 to achieve a progressive rebalancing of the property sector, reducing
large imbalances between free and subsidized housing. The first priority has been
help families, who especially suffered the pressures of the real estate boom
first and then were affected by the crisis, investing in housing 50%
annual average over the previous Government, and building a 23% housing
protected. The Basic Income Emancipation, which has enabled 300,000 young
emancipation has been a mainstay of the socialist housing policy in recent years.
5.2 The future of socialist policies related to families: new
challenges, best solutions
The important role of families we want to progress and the
social and economic changes that have occurred in recent years demand
continue efforts in this area. The negative impact of the economic crisis

- 94 -

equality of the XXI century is equal opportunity

 

the most vulnerable families and the unsuitability of our protection system
new types of families, (eg .: single) or child vulnerability in this

-

The two great challenges of child protection in Spain are poverty
Children and violence against children. Minors are

6 By the equality
The most significant social changes of recent decades that have shaped it
women in developed societies, with far-reaching implications
in many areas. The Socialists have promoted and accompanied the process,
providing unparalleled qualitative leap which has positioned Spain to
European avant-garde. It is fair to point out the contribution of the feminist movement
in this historic breakthrough and the ability to recognize their social dialogue
organizations. Socialist governments of the past eight years are the most
- 98 -

equality of the XXI century is equal opportunity

 

they have done in this country for the effective equality of women and in the shortest amount of
time.

6.1 Moving forward not backward. Complete the regulatory development
The for which we have provided legal framework has led to fundamental changes
unthinkable a few years ago. The Equal aims latter
effective equality between women and men, promoting the full integration of
social life women overcoming any kind of labor, cultural discrimination,
economic and political. Thanks to proactive framework developed in the Act
Equality have joined the political culture new concepts and new challenges:
parity democracy, responsibility and gender mainstreaming among others. The
Law against Gender Violence is the best legal instrument capable of
provide a global response to the violence perpetrated against women,
their children, providing a social environment refusal to male violence.
The Law on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Voluntary Interruption of Pregnancy is
fundamental part of preventive policies and the right to public health; their
approval has led to the recognition of the right of women to decide on
her own motherhood, ending the legal uncertainty affecting the
women and health professionals intervening in disruptions
unwanted pregnancies.
Equality policies are the best guarantee of economic and social prosperity. Without
But much remains to be consolidated. We will complete regulatory developments
endowments and resources of all kinds provided by law effective equality
women and men and the law against domestic violence. Both have meant
fundamental changes that need to settle.
Regulations developing these laws continue conducting assessments
periodic application, with the aim of correcting dysfunctions and redouble
efforts where necessary.
6.2 Towards full gender equality
The Equality Act passed in 2007 has led to some significant progress.
It is increasingly shared the rejection of unequal treatment between men and women,
but we must continue working in that line. Effort and stay from
all areas, paying particular attention to the full equality of women in
employment and in decision-making processes.
Because of its great potential multiplier we will promote the inclusion of content
promote gender equality in education to settle
attitudes, values ​​and behaviors engaged from an early age.
Since public institutions disseminating and awareness drive on
equality between men and women in all aspects seeking participation
active groups and associations of civil society.
To achieve higher levels of equality in our society, the momentum of the
mainstreaming and implementation of policies sensitive to gender issues,
it is essential to have more women in positions of political decision. The
Equality Act has institutionalized a number of compulsory elements
pursue the increased presence of women in positions of representation

- 99 -

equality of the XXI century is equal opportunity


 

policy. Models will encourage peer-making, participatory decision
and horizontal networking in political organizations and will ensure real parity
in organizational and institutional structures.
6.3 The future economy needs to use all the talent of a country
The constant promotion of the incorporation of women into the workplace in conditions
equality will be a top priority for socialists. In the XXI century it
unthinkable that there unwarranted activity rates of men differences
and women, as well as the basic conditions of employment. Harnessing
all the talent available in a country, including the potential of women
inactive or performing work of lower quality than those for which they are
prepared, it carries significant economic returns.
The full incorporation of women into the labor market, matching his
employment participation rates of men would be a 19% increase
Spanish GDP. We propose to all political forces and social agents with a
specific plan to facilitate entry into the labor market of at least two
millions of women in a strategy for the medium and long term, which would match
the volume of male employment in today. This plan will have as main
activation target of women in new economic sectors where those
sources of employment that contribute to the change of model are
productive. In this line facing sectors and sustainable future, in which
fight segregation of occupations between men and women, will strengthen the
active employment policies for women, with the establishment of routes
custom professional.
Along with the increased activation we will act decisively to correct a series of
dysfunctions detected in the working conditions of many women. Between
these, the pay gap (the difference between the salaries of men and women
by performing the same work reaches on average 20%), higher rates
of temporary, part-time contracts and intermittent abandonment of activity
work for reasons of child care and dependent relatives along the
career. Also, we will act against vertical segregation (the poor
presence of women in management positions, known as "glass ceiling") and
Horizontal (by type of work as the traditional roles of men and women).
In this line, we propose the following measures:
-

The implementation of a mandatory quota system boards
administration of large companies in order to achieve a representation
balanced for both genders. The progressive increase will respond to a plan
eight evaluable years will reach 20% of women on boards of
Administration in the first four years and an additional 20% in the four
following. Also we establish incentives to encourage the presence
provided of women on boards and in management positions
directors of all companies.

-

We will encourage the adoption and implementation of equality plans
companies and institutions under the Equality Act, whose extension must
extended progressively. We will regulate the reduction of the wage gap

- 100 -

equality of the XXI century is equal opportunity

 

Be the first objective of equality plans of companies. It will be required
as a condition of access to public aid the enforcement of
equality. We will promote the value of gender equality by the rules
ISO business quality and
in evaluating standards
Corporate social responsibility of business, and the granting of
awards to the best practices of equality must necessarily reverse
in extending the same to other companies. In this sense, so
parallel, recognition of the figure of equality agents support
as experts in the implementation and evaluation of such measures, which
It will also generate new jobs.
-

We will strengthen the labor inspectorate to monitor conditions
equality in the workplace and the eventual sanction of situations involving
an employment discrimination, especially in employment sectors
feminized.

-

Training pathways and career guidance are to promote
occupational diversification of women. Special attention will be paid to the
retraining of unemployed women for access to jobs
new sources of employment, with accompaniment to the insertion
labor. In addition, the templates that integrate these women in new sectors
They emerging positively valued for the granting of public support,
as reinforcements complementary training plans.

-

We will encourage entrepreneurship among women through programs
self-employment training, advice on business formulas and facilities
for the establishment, management and development of cooperatives or entities
social economy. microcredit line will be implemented especially
aimed at women who have viable projects considered by the entity
public funding.

-

Older women have a potential that must be addressed so
specific public policies for continuous training and through programs
to channel their experience so you can revert to other women
generations that start in the labor, business and cooperative life.

-

The increase in the birth rate in Spain is essential to maintain
Welfare state of the future. Motherhood remains a major obstacle to
the career of too many women. The negative impact on
many cases have to work life can not continue to bear in
solitude families, especially women. Therefore we will promote measures
to enable workers, mainly women workers, not having to
choose between personal life, work and family, prioritizing and putting another one.
Our commitment to responsibility, supporting families and extending
the network of nursery schools (0-3) are essential to the final
incorporation of women into the workplace.

-

In rural areas, access of women to the labor market by encouraging passes
self-employment and make visible the work actually performed. Ownership Act
Shared farms recently approved an advance
historical, which gives recognition and rights to the work performed by the

- 101 -


 

equality of the XXI century is equal opportunity

livestock farmers and women on family farms. Women
rural have the added difficulty of isolation where they develop
mainly its activity. We continue intensifying development policy
enrollment of women working in a family farm as
joint holders thereof, and the regularization of work situations
informal women working in the field as long-term cause
situations of social vulnerability.
6.4 Eradication of gender violence
-

The law against gender violence has served to generate a social culture
revulsion to violence against women, probably the most serious manifestation of the
inequality between women and men. However, there is still an
continuous drip of women killed by their partners. Therefore to follow
working. Special attention deserve the particularities of violence
gender in the case of women with disabilities, immigrants or children.
In the latter case, it is necessary to work more on prevention since ages
early, with awareness campaigns and guidance and affective within
outside the education system, including the development of skills
identify violent partners from the first signs of the problem. The
educational and informational materials of these educational programs and
awareness should be accessible free of charge.

-

We will continue developing the application of the law against gender violence,
enhancing their effectiveness with the following specific measures:

-

To facilitate reporting, counseling and care for victims,
We propose to create "one-stop care for gender violence" in
which thanks to intergovernmental cooperation, will be centralized all
care and protection for women victims of gender violence
legal, professional and welfare nature, including the same resource
It helps the handling of abuse complaints to the police, information
on specialized emergency medical care, psychological care,
emergency shelters, financial assistance or measures to the
labor integration. These services will have access, with victims
gender violence within the couple, victims of sexual violence
until now there has not been enough object specific attention.

-

In cases where the victim's request is recognized and its viability is
provide support for the social and economic reintegration of victims
at different locations or regions of origin.

-

Intensify awareness strategies against violence.
We will promote the services host enhance networking
social support between women who often have in common insulation
social.

-

Strengthen action to protect women whose aggressors will
out of jail. They shall apply precautionary measures for physical protection and
psychological children under reported and convicted parents
gender violence. They devote adequate public resources for

- 102 -

equality of the XXI century is equal opportunity

 

complete rehabilitation of victims and their children, including care centers
specialized training and job placement for specific victims
gender violence.
-

It is necessary to denounce socially visible and trafficking in women for
exploitation as a form of violence against women violates the
human rights. To eradicate this practice propose confiscate property
of convicted traffickers to be destined to the improvement and protection of
victims. In relation to legal proceedings, we propose that the burden of
evidence in any case rest on the victims of trafficking and the protection is not
linked to the complaint or subsequent testimony at trial. The guarantee will be strengthened
witness protection and the precautionary measures in relation to offenses
related to trafficking.

-

The fight against this current form of slavery also requires thinking
globally and act locally. We need a strong strategy to combat
the social evil of prostitution, with a clear line of zero tolerance
this promotion and business around the traffic involved
People with purpose of sexual exploitation. We want a society without
sexual exploitation and pledge to work to eliminate prostitution and
change the social model of domination and inequality that makes it possible,
raising awareness in the society buying prostitution services
contributes to the establishment in our country of mafias that profit from women
to which they have kidnapped their rights.

-

In this line, we will ban prostitution ads.

7. Coexistence and integration in the society of S XXI
7.1 Effective integration for social cohesion
Social cohesion is a key element to achieve economic prosperity and
balanced social. Companies with lower levels of inequality have
also less social unrest, crime, health problems, especially
psychological, and better educational indicators. They, in turn, factors
determinants of balanced economic growth and future. The social capital
our country is one of the greatest assets are there in the Spanish society,
thanks to continued efforts common in recent years.
The socialist commitment to flattering integration of social cohesion forever
It has been clear. Thus, we promote and develop socialist consolidation
social security system in Spain, since the 1985 Act to the Toledo Pact and its
reserve fund, which accumulates 64,000 million. As a result of
work in this area in recent years have significantly improved income
families with lower incomes and reduced poverty among the elderly, with
annual increases in the minimum wage or the maintenance of
policy revaluation of minimum pensions and non-contributory.
In line with this commitment, the Socialist government has prioritized the preservation of
social cohesion from the first moments of the crisis. The protection of
people most affected by situations of social vulnerability with a clear focus

- 103 -


 

equality of the XXI century is equal opportunity

redistributive has been a central objective of the measures aimed at recovery
at all stages thereof. Thus, it has increased family income, provided the
mortgage payments or specially catered to families affected by the
unemployment, through temporary protection program for unemployment and insertion,
and other policies to address costs of basic character
households with lower incomes.
It has also been significant progress in the integration of specific groups
most at risk of exclusion or subject to discrimination. In recent years, the
Socialist government has launched the care of people with disabilities
in situations of dependency, and the effective implementation of universal accessibility,
promoting the employment of people with disabilities. In addition, the focus of
system integration of Spanish immigration driven by the Socialist government
Spain has become an international example of coexistence. Even as the country
Europe with the highest number of immigrants has received in recent years, it is
also one of the least problems including records. Furthermore, the Government
Socialist has recognized the right to vote in local elections to groups
immigrants.
The socialist commitment to civil society organizations working in the fight against
situations of inequality and exclusion has been continued and firm. This has been
collection action in our government with the inclusion for the first time in the
Spanish legislation on the definition and recognition of the Third Sector in the Act
Personal Autonomy and Care for Dependent People. As
result of socialist policies and the changes that have occurred in our
society in recent years, the proliferation of solidarity associations in Spain
It has been enormous. The Socialists identify this as an opportunity to get a
social concert between the public and private sectors to create an effective framework
social intervention.
7.2 The future of integration policies for socialists, new challenges,
best solutions
The changes that occur in our society, and new challenges in the field
integration, requiring new approaches and measures to the maintenance and
strengthening social cohesion. Our society is increasingly diverse,
multigenerational, diverse, and our integration policies must adapt and
anticipate these changes to ensure coexistence in equality. Thus,
over today, and tomorrow, enjoy health, concerns and aspirations
unprecedented in our history.
Furthermore, the economic situation has increased the number of people living in
social vulnerability, which especially affects public already subject
susceptible to discrimination or exclusion. This new reality requires a
reinforcement of policies aimed at inclusion and reduce reproduction
intergenerational poverty. Also, the sector of social action (the so-called
Third Sector), plays an increasingly important role in this field, to be
recognize and properly reinforced.
A new corporate culture is born of the realization of the growing power
economic, political and social enterprises capable of generating employment impacts,

equality of the XXI century is equal opportunity

 

environmental and socioeconomic increasingly massive and important time, and
enormous vulnerability of large firms to public opinion, to a society that
more transparent, more connected and informed and therefore able to judge,
reward and punish corporate behavior. In its corporate reputation,
companies also play their own future.
Socialists work on improving policies related to the
integration and coexistence to achieve the following objectives:
-

Encourage active aging of our older, facilitating
active participation in society.

Progress towards the full integration of people with disabilities.

Improve and ensure the integration of the foreign population, and ensuring
encouraging especially in the international context an effective framework

The bench.

7.2.1 A social security system of the future

existing resources, to combat fraud and detection areas
the need to strengthen the conditions of access to benefits and
incompatibilities between pensions from various administrations,
while maintaining the principles of ensuring living conditions
linking the minimum effort and contribution made that underlie
of our system. We must also continue to promote social welfare
Further, so we are committed to reform and Funds Act
Pension Plans 1988 to strengthen in particular related funds
collective bargaining.

in developing a Strategy for State character that aims the
eradication of prejudice and discrimination based on age.

7.2.3 Towards full integration of persons with disabilities
The lack of effective public intervention can condemn people with
disability entrenched exclusion situations at different levels: in the
labor, health, social, political or infrastructure level. Therefore, intervention
public in this area is particularly necessary in order to ensure
equal opportunities for this group, and their ability to make effective
contribution to economic and social development.
-

Disability and dependence are connected realities, but at the same time
clearly differentiated. All persons in situations of dependency are
disabled people but not all people with disabilities are
people in a situation of dependency. Disability can not be subsumed or
disappear in the department, it has its own identity and precise policies and
devices designed specifically for this reality.

-

We will promote a strategy of public-private partnership to continue
fostering innovation in goods and services to the accessibility
people with varying abilities and the provision of potential
users of these goods and services, ensuring universal accessibility.

Integral to victims of domestic violence protection.

7.2.4 Integrating different immigration policies
To ensure equal opportunities and the overall development of our
society, socialists we need to invest maximum efforts possible
all administrations to the group of new citizens
who have come to live among us reach full educational, social integration and
work in Spain, strengthening public services concerned so that they can give
meet the needs of all beneficiaries, without exclusion or
discrimination.

- 108 -

equality of the XXI century is equal opportunity

 

We will also continue developing a model to immigration control
of inflows betting on the regularity and allows managing
tickets and residence in accordance with the possibilities of the labor market.
For this, we propose the following suggestions:
-

We will work to ensure the full integration in key environments: the
school, business and neighborhood. Public action is exercised through proximity

Integrate migration as a crosscutting issue that concerns all policies
public for the protection of vulnerable groups susceptible,
discrimination or inequality.

-

Strengthen policies and prevention activities in situations of
social exclusion of immigrants as a key component of the
actions to be developed in terms of reception.

diversity in schools, and work in other social spaces. Thus,
values ​​education is a cornerstone of the curriculum, which encourages
anti-racist education and to promote tolerant and sensitive to behaviors
cultural diversity.

V. DEMOCRACY
1. Introduction
The crisis has been caused by market failures and policy failures. Other
This electoral program sections have addressed how to fix address
first, especially in the home. In this section we deal with how
address seconds. We must strengthen our political and our democracies. But
It will not be enough to do so in the home. It will also be necessary
so in the international arena, since the crisis is global.
Modern democracies are based on two types of legitimacy: in origin and
exercise. Indeed, democracies are legitimized when they work, and are able
to meet the needs and demands of citizens. But for the
Democracies can be effective, to have legitimacy through its exercise,
They must be also legitimate source, through processes
formation of the popular will. Both issues are closely
connected: a necessary condition for the effectiveness of a democracy is its
standing in origin. But as much as a democracy is entitled
procedurally, if not effective, you lose power and scope.
Our democracy has worked well, both from the point of view of its effectiveness
and from the perspective of the rules for its operation. Across
our democracy, we could meet citizens' demands for
more welfare, education, health, social services, etc. It has been effective,
Also, to manage the markets. However, the economic crisis
growing perception that our democracy has lost effectiveness, that in
particular, the policy has not been able to gain control of markets. In
that perception is largely true, since markets are global, but the
policy, and our democracies are still domestic. So you have to
perfecting our democracies, and doing both domestically and internationally:
so they are short of what citizens demand, so they can
combat more effectively the challenges before us, so
they can govern better to markets.
In part, we will make our democracies more effective if we reform
its rules and procedures. This is well within our country, where there
a lawsuit, which the Socialists understand justified by greater
representation in our electoral system, greater proportionality, by
a stronger connection between representative and represented, for more transparency and
rigor, for a more open government. We can do all these reforms and
will. But it will not suffice if we in the strictly national level, too
to work internationally to extend and strengthen the
democracy. For there to be more Europe and a better Europe, more democratic.
For there to be more and better international institutions to govern
globalization, and that they are democratic, transparent and open.
We are committed to the Spanish first, and second with the rest of the
citizens to undertake these reforms. If we do not, we can not
better market order. If we do not, we will have to continue living with the
- 114 -

democracy


 

paradox that while our world is now global, democracies, and
policies remain local.
Our commitment is this: we will improve the quality of democracy in Spain, and
contribute to do so internationally.
2. Improve the quality of our democracy
Socialists believe that we must improve the quality of our
domestic democracy at least three levels: we need more transparency and
more open government. We need to improve the connection between voters and elected
representatives and represented, in short, between politicians and citizens.
Also we need to adopt and amend a number of rules in our uses and
parliamentary procedures, so that the most important institutions
for our democracy, Congress and the Senate work better and more so
transparent and open to the public.
2.1 More transparency and more open government
Our young democracy has worked well. It has been a good compromise
between representation and governance. But it is true that it is time to
improve it. And to improve, the first thing we have to do is increase the
public scrutiny of political action. Citizens must be able to control
more direct, closer, more effective, what their representatives, is to
then you can make better decisions about their political choices. To obtain
that objective, it is necessary that the political system more transparent. And it is
also necessary that governments, administrations, the Communities
Regions, municipalities, are much more open to citizens. In this
field propose several measures:
Adopt a Law of Transparency and Access to Public Information, such
so that the governments and their administrations are not subject to scrutiny
only political parties of the opposition, but also the
citizens. To this end, we will adopt the implementing provisions of the law, such
so that:
•

Will regulate the right of access to information produced by the powers
public.

•

More specifically, we will expand the circle of citizens that they can
access information generating Governments and Administrations

•

We will also expand the type of information held by governments and
Administrations that may be susceptible made public, or at least of
transmitted to those who demonstrate a legitimate interest in it.

•

Specifically, we will establish the "legislative footprint", ie,
We force them to publish any decision or action involving the adoption
legislation or other provisions adopted by the public authorities,
mainly if the decisions involve spending.

•

This will affect the legislature, the executive and the Administration, and
He referred particularly to personnel matters, wages, contracts

- 115 -

democracy


 

Public Administrations, subsidies, planning and management
patrimonial.

-

•

Specifying latter, we force them to publish wages and
Heritage Senior Officers and general staff of political confidence.

•

In addition, we will adopt the necessary legal reforms to ensure that
public office can not charge more than a salary of Administrations
Public or political parties.

•

To ensure maximum transparency in the activities of Administrations
Public and in line with legislation passed in the European Union on the
matter, it will join the Law on Transparency regulation
interest groups.

Also we approve a Strategy for Open Government, since not enough
simply that citizens can access the information
Governments and their administrations; It is also necessary to provide mechanisms
so that citizens can participate more actively in the formulation of
the politics. In this respect, the law shall provide for the following measures:
•

We will strengthen and extend the Government to address the
citizens to channel their participation in public affairs via
electronically, via the Internet or other possibilities that ICTs
(Information Technology and Communication) offering go, for
eg mobile telephony.

•

The law will ensure the possibility of public participation in the process
most important legislation.

2.2 A healthy, independent and pluralistic audiovisual sector
The audiovisual sector urgently needs an overall performance that guarantees
citizens access to accurate information, in a contrasting opinion
representative voices of all ideological sectors of society, and a
leisure that encourages creators and enrich listeners culturally and
spectators. An enforceable desirable for the private media mission, but the
public.
In pursuing this goal, we propose the following measures:
Measures for the proper management of the sector
-

In accordance with laid down in the General Law on Audiovisual Communication
and numerous requests from the Community institutions we have
formulated in a while, we will promote the effective establishment of the Council
State Broadcasting (CEMA), reflecting the maturity institution
existing democratic in all European countries who previously
they created.

-

We are committed to this, and we want both operators and
citizens have the certainty that the CEMA ensure compliance
legal provisions affecting this sector, which foster areas
- 116 -

democracy


 

self-regulation and co-regulation in certain matters related to the
content. The CEMA address the needs of operators and monitor the
compliance with existing obligations in this sector, especially the protection
most vulnerable groups such as minors or disabled relative
with accessibility measures to be applied to the contents. The
judicial supervision of the decisions of these regulators is
the ultimate guarantee to our rule of law.
- The Autonomous Communities must have a Audiovisual Authority
independent of the executive with similar functions to those of CEMA.
As envisaged in the law on Audiovisual, we believe it would be very positive, and
so we power, the establishment of a representative councils of all
active social sectors in each community, without remuneration for their
members, who periodically transmit their comments and proposals on
the operation of the regional public media.
-

Moreover, given the high number of televisions in the distribution of fruit TDT
licenses in the various geographical boundaries, at the regional level and
local study finding solutions to decrease the volume
total projected operating permits and licenses, facilitating the return of
licenses to those who can not or do not want to exploit them.

Measures to ensure public television service
We need to review the mechanisms used to finance our
public television, because we must ensure adequate future funding
in the future, avoiding distortions in competition with other operators and
ensuring a sufficient sizing to offer citizens a
television and modern, independent, public radio quality in line with the
actual society.
We must also ensure that if the EU understands that operators
telecommunications should not contribute to the financial sustainability of RTVE,
there may be alternative means of financing public service.
While respecting its own sphere of competence, we will propose that the
Regions where has not yet been implemented that principle governing the
composition of the bodies of their audiovisual entities in accordance with the
criteria established for RTVE.
Measures to support the sector's development
- The current process of technological convergence has meant that citizens
They can access multiple content across multiple media. Even
It is changing the way people consume audiovisual content and other services
operators offer citizens. Logically, the regulation of these
scenarios requires measures or instruments and flexible enough
adapted to the reality of the sector and their needs, requirements and
aspirations. In this sense, it seems certain that in the next appearance
new possibilities and technologies, such as 3D and connected TV
Internet, we must remain vigilant to provide a regulation

- 117 -

democracy


 

immediate and efficient of these new challenges, both for operators, as
ultimately citizens.
- Additionally, we will favor the development of a media sector
sanitized communication, as an advanced democratic society requires
some independent media and solvents. In this sense, another act
We will continue to support and which directly affects the configuration
new audiovisual landscape, is the possibility that the televisions so
choosing to concentrate or integrated in order to increase the degree of
competitiveness in an increasingly global audiovisual scene.
- Also support the development of the digitization of radio, driving a
technology standard that enables further improvements and radio services
benefit of citizens.
2.3 The reform of our electoral system
You also need to reform our electoral law, with two objectives: the
relationship between representative and represented more direct, and improve
representativeness of our political system.
Specifically, we will reform the Organic Law 5/1985 of June 19, Regime
General Election, which requires, in accordance with Article 81.2º of the Constitution
Spanish, the absolute majority in Congress. We propose a consensual agreement
around a system that approximates the German model. While this consensus
develops, we will negotiate with other political forces including the
following modifications:
-

We propose the possibility of electoral lists unlocked with
possibility of preferential voting for a number of candidates according to
existing model in some European countries.

-
Establish, for the municipal elections, and in line with what
will for national elections, a system unlocked lists
allow the citizen in the list submitted by each political party,
prefer one or several of its members.

-

We pledge to move forward to push for electoral reform
ensure a truly balanced representation between men and women
electoral lists.

-

We study internet voting as a complementary system to vote by mail
and the vote in the consulate, taking the example of countries like Switzerland.

2.4 Reforms to improve citizen participation in politics
More than thirty years after the promulgation of the Spanish Constitution, citizenship
demand further efforts to improve our democratic system. In these
recent months we have heard in our streets to claim a
It has been more open and more transparent, participatory and political practice
inclusive.
Indeed, civic participation and free expression of pluralism and
Spanish diversity in society is one of the deepest values ​​of
- 118 -

democracy


 

PSOE. Socialists believe firmly in the dialogue and search
agreements qualify as a formula for political activity and responsibility
institutions.
The Spanish citizenship requires more space for political participation, more
channels for the expression of their proposals, and most current tools and
effective to meet the content of the articles of the Constitution
recognize our right to "freely express and disseminate thoughts, ideas and
opinions "(Article 20) and to" participate in public affairs, directly or through
through representatives "(Article 23).
In the spirit of bringing decisively to political institutions
citizenship, the Socialists propose updating laws, rules and the
Regulations governing public participation in Parliament, providing
the following proposals:
-

Call for a broad participation process driven
municipalities to articulate proposals to enact a new law
Basic Civic and Institutional Participation in implementation of Article 23 of the
Spanish Constitution.

-

Facilitate and improve procedures for the Popular Legislative Initiative (ILP) in the
Congress and the Senate, reducing constraints and requirements, and offering
possibility of a "deputy 351", representing the promoters of the ILP,
to intervene throughout the -Pleno Commission, Ponenciacon legislative process voice but no vote. You will receive technical support services to the Chamber
Like any other Member or parliamentary group. They established a
diets so it can carry out their work without any financial loss.
Finally, the possibility of transferring this experience to the Senate will be studied.

-

Conversion of the Committee on Petitions in a truly Commission
Citizen participation.

-

Set in the legislative process the requirement that the officers of the
Relevant committees organize a session of hearings of the
representatives of the affected sectors of society, so that deputies
listen to their views and proposals before forming the editors papers.

-

Regular open government, so that all levels of government
should establish channels in digital networks to publicize their initiatives and
for assessments and citizen proposals via the web
officers and encouraging participation in the most common social networks.

-

Institutionalization of a true "service charter" of deputies and
Senators, regulating exhaustively its obligations, direct contact
communication with their constituents.

-

The PSOE in their territory guarantee the existence of parliamentary offices
open to the public.

2.5 The deepening of citizens' rights
The last two legislatures have been a breakthrough in extension
social and civil rights. We refer to the care system, still in

- 119 -

democracy


 

the time of initial implementation, improved social benefits and
family, new health benefits or aid linked to unemployment.
Also in the area of ​​civil rights we have passed the Equality Act
between men and women, new rules of family law regarding
marriage, separation and divorce, adoption or access to civil registry.
In this new phase, in addition to consolidating the advances, we continue to win
spaces for freedom and equality of citizens in the following areas:
-

Returning to the draft submitted by the Government in this legislature,
We approve dignified death law to regulate the rights of people
in the process the end of life. The current regulation has loopholes and
gaps that give rise to sometimes respect for the will of each
in every moment of life, and of death, being uninsured
fully meet family own health or social institutions, or.
Furthermore, the uncertainty in which health professionals are moving in this
field calls for more precise regulation. And as important as all that,
the process end of life should be done in a context of performance and
care especially attentive to the needs and respect for the
personal and family privacy.

-

Returning to the draft sent by the Government to Parliament, approve the
comprehensive law on equal treatment and non-discrimination, to prohibit all
form of discrimination that eventually leads to the exclusion and therefore
loss for all citizens in areas such as employment, education, the
public deliberation, social care or, in general, all the
public life and social integration.

-

The Act consider necessary to promote social awareness
preventive and public mobilization against hate crimes and
discrimination, the creation of a specialized prosecution in this matter, and
encourage the establishment of counseling services for victims of discrimination
and hate crimes.

-

In this sense, we consider necessary to ensure the enforcement of
games when he says that a political party may be declared illegal when
in the exercise of their activity systematically violates the freedoms and
fundamental rights, promoting, justifying or exonerating attacks
against life or integrity of the people, or the exclusion or persecution
people because of their ideology, religion or beliefs, nationality, race,
sex or sexual orientation.

In other areas related to non-discrimination:
- Foster a regulation providing a legal framework for couples wanting
formalize their living via the register of partners, creating a
central registry and recognizing the right to succession and joint adoption of the
registered partners, be they the same or different sex.
- In recent years our country has become an international reference
in recognition of the civil rights of lesbians, gays, transsexuals and
- 120 -

democracy


 

bisexual. These profound changes in the recognition of equality and
diversity have brought other issues that require legislative improvements
and legislative initiatives in areas such as affiliation, education or donation
eggs among married women.
- We will promote measures to ensure equal opportunities for
transgender people.
-

Spain will promote the development of the European Programme for Action
Community Progress (2007-2013) and especially Section 4, called
"Antidiscrimination and diversity", which aims to support the effective implementation of
principle of non-discrimination and promote its incorporation into all
EU policies.

Roma:
- Continue to promote the functioning of the bodies of participation and
dialogue of Roma social organizations, through the State Council
the Roma and expedite the work of the Roma Cultural Institute in its
task of spreading and promoting Roma culture.
- We will promote agreements between the public authorities to regulate
Exercise peddling.
- We will promote measures to facilitate the accessibility of the Roma
professional and vocational training and university education,
promoting programs to reduce illiteracy and truancy, and
as support for self-employment and training of entrepreneurs.
2.6 Reforms to deepen the secular Spanish State
The secular state is inseparable from the idea of ​​freedom and equality. The vast
Most people love the personal freedom from religious impositions.
They appreciate that constitutional secularism is a guarantee for individual freedom and
that promotes coexistence principle of equal citizens with different beliefs.
It is a positive secularism.
In our country with a remarkable process of secularization and decreased
traditional religious practice there has been a quantitative and qualitative increase of
religious diversity, which involves changes in life and in cultural traditions
our towns and cities and also not exempt from public policies
controversy and contradictions.
This diversity of identities is a characteristic feature of most of the
European countries in what is one of its greatest challenges: how to build
social, cultural and political life of the country from the diversity cohesion, how to build a
idea of ​​common citizenship in our democracies and how to avoid referrals to
extremism that threaten gender equality, rights
individual and democracy.
The separation of state and religious confessions, is a positive step
promoting religious pluralism and freedom not to profess any religion. In this
ground propose the following measures:

- 121 -

democracy


 

Ensure religious neutrality in public spaces and acts as
the State has the duty to ensure that in the areas protected by the
government there is no confusion between public and religious.
We shall abolish privileges are preserved in the mortgage legislation
benefit of the Catholic Church. The Mortgage Act drag a privilege in favor of
the Catholic Church, a tributary of the past and entirely unjustified, that
equated the Catholic Church to the regional governments and corporations
public law empowering it to issue its own certificates of domain
absence of written title to which is contrary to its legal nature
and the Establishment Clause of the State. Therefore we will proceed to
amend Article 206 of the Mortgage Act and 304 of its Rules to
eliminate this unjustified privilege.
2.7 The optimization of our system of decentralization of power
Our rule of autonomy implies an unqualified success. However, a
period of economic crisis we are living, there is a need, more
even if possible, to act in a more coordinated way. Meanwhile, our
territorial organization at the local level needs to be more effective.
The federal culture is the system of multilevel governance that best meets the
challenges in complex societies and advanced democracies, Spain is not a
exception. But it is not only a technique of decentralization, it is a philosophy
policy based on the pact and that is an exercise of democratic radicalism. A
pact of coexistence that combines political autonomy of the parties and the
project work for a union where everyone wins.
In these areas we will carry out the following reforms:
We establish the "National Strategy", particularly in areas
Electoral Program this means that are strategic to Spain from
economic terms and for job creation; we mean,
particularly to sectors such as vocational training, education,
immigration, health, entrepreneurs, and R & D + i. These strategies will be
executed through what we call federal plans. Strategies
National plans are configured as real coordination between
Central and regional territorial levels. They will be taken by the Government of
Spain, in consultation and cooperation with the governments of the Communities
Autonomous. They large country objectives and funding will be established
appropriate to undertake them. Regions that receive
funding include the National Strategies, they shall undertake to fulfill
the objectives set by these plans, under the conditions set by the
National Strategies. Sectoral conferences will be responsible for
monitor compliance with the National Strategies.
These national strategies should have a European horizon.
To achieve these objectives it is necessary to promote dialogue, consultation,
collaboration and coordination between administrations to allow the adoption of
joint or coordinated decisions and their implementation within a framework of mutual loyalty
according to their respective powers. This involves the empowerment of
- 122 -

democracy


 

Conference of Presidents, the sectorial conferences and all frames and
institutional mechanisms for multilateral cooperation, without prejudice to the recognition
and bilateral action in their own areas, as they are defined in the
Statutes of Autonomy and legislation.
We will promote the reorganization of local governments and deep modernization
of the Provincial Councils. The new configuration of the local administration
supramunicipal should keep in mind the existence of an administration
regional services of provincial character, both as political reinforcement
technician municipalities, and the supplementary role that the Constitution and
laws regarding development assigned to municipalities. In this sense, Andalusia,
with its municipal law, it is a reference for local administration
more streamlined, efficient and effective. The transformation of the Provincial Councils
in Councils of Mayors will allow the delimitation of its competencies,
simplifying its structure and significant reduction of political representation,
guaranteeing the jobs of officials and staff of current
Councils. It should be given differential treatment for the Island Councils or
Councils are local institutions and, consequently, we advocate keeping
and secure them.
Develop the provisions of Law 7/1985, of 2 April, regulating the
Local Rules, concerning relations between the state level,
regional and local. Specifically, the Government shall encourage the nation
administrative agreements and partnerships, and encourage the creation of bodies
collaboration and coordination between administrations, particularly in the field of
the provision of social services.
The legislative changes affecting the local world must take into account
the reality of our municipal structure, which has 5,791 municipalities with fewer than
2,000. Laws and regulations must be adapted to the possibilities
management of the municipality. Legislative changes also contemplate
that non-mandatory services for municipalities with fewer than 5,000
residents can be provided by associations, counties, consortia or
other associative schemes.
Local financing has undergone extraordinary performances along the
legislature have provided additional investment funds for municipalities
value of 13,000 million euros. Furthermore, they have faced a number of other
exceptional measures to provide to local authorities credit lines
which enabled them to meet their needs, despite the difficulties
financial by traversing the set of public administrations.
However, the economic situation has made it impossible to discuss and promote a new
local financing framework. The challenge of raising this new model
funding should resume with economic recovery and growth. A
Local, stable and true, financing guarantees the autonomy of the institutions
Local to manage their interests and to provide quality services to the
citizenship.
The new funding model must provide sufficient funding to
municipalities to meet their responsibilities. Local financing has to come

the contributions of the State, the participation of municipalities in revenues
the autonomous communities and fiscal responsibility of local authorities,
on the basis of a municipal tax system adapted to the new situation and
evolution of the local reality. Therefore, we commit to socialist momentum

The role that municipalities must exercise in the XXI century demands that have a
appropriate legal and jurisdictional framework. Therefore, in the next legislature
We will face the redefinition, updating and modernizing the framework

In addition to improving democratic control mechanisms at local level
propose to implement the status of the opposition, so that the political groups

audit work.
Socialists maintain our strong commitment to constitutional reform
Senate without giving the rest of constitutional reforms proposed
previous electoral programs, such as the mention of the Autonomous Communities
in the Constitution, referring to the process of European integration or warranty
gender equality in access to the Crown.
Regardless of the constitutional reform of the Senate, it is possible and necessary
advance the concerted action by the government, making the
most of the resources of all of them to increase the competitiveness of Spain in the
world and to ensure the maintenance and development of public services to
citizens. In that sense, we are committed to improving the functioning and
coordination of the Conference of Presidents and the Sectorial Conferences.

reduce the political structure of municipalities, autonomous regions and state. The reduction of
public office representative shall, in any case, respecting the

institutions, which are willing to exercise fully all
possibilities of administrative and judicial review and strengthen public position

capacity, reducing the need for factual knowledge and
including apprenticeships, to preferentially evaluate values

the changes. In particular, access to higher bodies of the
Administration is necessary to promote equal opportunities through
the implementation of a system to facilitate the preparation of a test

PSOE.
During the last two legislatures, the Socialists have launched from the
Government of Spain a wide range of measures, strategic significance, aimed at

Civil protection of citizens and their property against risks
catastrophes or natural disasters, or accidents due to human action,
is one of the pillars of our security policy, understood and articulated
in a comprehensive sense.

-

In the framework of what is established in the Spanish Security Strategy us
mark for the next term the following objectives:

and dictatorship. A law that has enjoyed a high degree of compliance.
However, it is an unfinished task. We undertake to promote the

3. To govern globalization and leading change
Powerful currents of change are transforming the world at high speed.
It's time for a new ambition, the time for action, not paralysis. The
Socialists want to make this change an ally, an opportunity to establish
globally a new political, economic and environmental paradigm,
restore the primacy of the general interest and return the policy to the forefront.
We do not want to be mere spectators. We affirm our ambition to lead and
These rule changes to our ideals and values-freedom, justice,
solidarity, equality, sustainability, tolerance and progress-because only then
get the new time we opened it more fair, balanced and
surely the now ending. Only thus we avoid a drift towards more
inequality in the world, to global impoverishment of rights and freedoms.
Our foreign policy is presented as a powerful and essential tool
essential to our political project to get Spain out of the crisis,
heal the damage that this has caused among the public and to contribute
actively to a new model of growth, development and global governance.
If today no country can cope alone the great global challenges and all
what happens outside our borders will have an impact within the design
foreign policy and vision of the world we want to charge more importance
never. The Socialists will promote a comprehensive foreign policy that maximizes
synergies with other national policies and the ability to bring together all the different
civil society actors involved, so multiply our projection in the
world.
A foreign policy that supports the firm defense of our legitimate
interests with the values ​​that we promote to build a world

3.1 An effective foreign policy to overcome the crisis
More and better Europe
Socialists believe that the solution lies in more and better Europe, for
resolutely progress in political, economic and social integration of the Union
European.
-

To solve the economic challenges we now face is a must
strengthen the institutions of economic governance of the European Union, better
coordination of economic policies of the Union, greater fiscal integration and
own European taxation, made with progressive criteria. In short,
building a genuine economic union alongside monetary union

-

Also, the Socialists will defend the launch true
Social Europe whose rules have the same force as the single market,
through the promotion of a European Social Pact and safeguard a state of
sustainable welfare.

-

The EU budget is a fundamental tool
to improve governance of the EU. It must be sufficient to enable the Union to
act effectively. Currently, the EU budget amounts
approximately 1% of GNI. Therefore, we will not accept a reduction of
budget but will defend its enlargement, according to the rest of
our European partners. Also, the Socialists will work
intensively to reform the current orientation of the EU budget
directing a greater extent, to meeting the objectives set by the
2020, and placing active policies for job creation and
training in the center of the next financial perspective.

-

In addition, we will propose new European funding sources. In
particular work with our community partners for the EU to adopt
a tax on international financial transactions, aimed at reducing the
speculation in financial markets. Part of the proceeds will
they spent on development cooperation policies and the fight against change
climate. A harmonized tax will also be proposed on emissions
CO2, easing the transition to a Europe free of CO2.

-

We will work for the establishment of a European Treasury, a Ministry of
Community Finance which, among other functions, be responsible for managing the
funds raised through European taxes and public debt issue
European. We reaffirm our commitment to ensure that the European Union
Count on Eurobonds, ie, it can issue public debt that is
supported by all eurozone countries. With this, the EU would get to
least three goals: reducing speculation in financial markets, get
more funding and lower the prices at which the EU is financed.

The European Central Bank, as also the European Investment Bank should
take an active role in economic and social growth of the EU. The ECB

EU and combating unemployment. We are asking that its mandate be extended and, if
necessary, the modification of the European treaties and legislation.
-

The Socialists propose the easing of the European Mechanism
Financial Stability (ESM). With a total capital amounting to 700,000
million euros, it is a very powerful tool to articulate aid
EU countries with financial difficulties. We think we must enunciate
also investment plans and stimulus to the economies most in need,
to solve not only the problem of debt, but also to the lack
economic growth needed to create jobs.

-

We work on tax harmonization in Europe. The EU needs
have more power to harmonize taxes by Member States,
so as to avoid tax competition between States
European.

-

We will raise the establishment of a European Rating Agency
Risk independently assess the true state of finances
Member states. Also we propose improvements in the regulation of
private risk assessment agencies, aimed in particular at
increasing European competition in this sector.
We advocate extending the legislative powers of the European Parliament in the
economic field. The European Parliament decides on issues such as
important as our internal market, the environment, our freedom,
security and justice or our consumer legislation. should also
to decide on major financial issues that affect all
the European Union, which would gain in efficiency, speed and range
mobility as well as in democratic legitimacy.
The Socialists continue to maintain our commitment to bring the
European government institutions to the public. We propose the adoption of
more democratic and transparent mechanisms in the election of officers
in front of the European institutions, in particular the President of the Commission
and the President of the European Council. Actively participate, along with the
forces that make up the European Socialist Party, in the choice and presentation
to European citizens of a common candidate or candidate for President of the
European Commission in the framework of the upcoming parliamentary elections
European. In regard to the President of the European Council, we propose that
Parliament itself is to give his final approval to the candidate
proposed by Member States.
Europe needs to strengthen its foreign policy for more political influence and
more leadership inside and outside the EU. Europe must speak with one voice
on the international scene to strengthen its role as a global actor. For that,
We propose a unified EU presence in international organizations
more relevant.
In addition, we need the institutions created by the Treaty of Lisbon -
Council President and the High Representative of the EU Affairs
Affairs and the Security Policy, assuming carry out their tasks more
accountability, visibility and political dimension.

We must move forward in the training and deployment of the European Service
External Action for effective promotion and defense of the interests
Common Union and its citizens, and to extend our influence
economic and trade in the world. In this area, we are committed to
maximize synergies between the EEAS and our diplomatic corps, drawing
the opportunity to redesign the latter, and turn it into an instrument
flexible, robust and agile.
In addition, the Socialists recall our commitment to the accession of
Turkey to the European Union. We understand that the accession of this country is a
premier strategic commitment that should occur in the shortest
deadlines, as soon as Turkey fully meets the requirements
for accession to the EU.
Strengthen international governance
To redirect globalization is essential to establish a true
worldwide political governance. The Socialists will promote a renewed
international architecture capable of governing dimensions of globalization
closely linked to each other: financial markets, international trade, solidarity
global and environmental sustainability. In short, more and better governance
International through in-depth reform of its institutions. More and
better rules for the international markets, establishing systems
monitoring, control and evaluation.
