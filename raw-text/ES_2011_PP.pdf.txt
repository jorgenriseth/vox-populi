Spain needs to change. Spaniards are in crisis
without precedents. The inability of the Socialist Party to deal
Spain has led to an unsustainable situation that must be overcome
sooner. With this manifesto the PP offers
Spanish alternative.
The balance of recent years is bleak: five million unemployed,
almost a million and a half of households with all members unemployed,
education system incapable of providing opportunities, a generation
Young expelled from the labor market and public accounts outside
control. In short, a bad government that does not generate the necessary confidence
for the country to obtain the credit they needed and that puts the real risk
basic features of the welfare system. The Spanish society today
impoverished and hopeless.
Renouncing institutional consensus and continuity, which they are part
the best collection of the constitutional Spain, the Socialist Party has
separate Spain of its modernization and reform path to take
the impoverishment, the prestige of their institutions and irrelevance
International.
Since 2004, successive governments have abandoned the reforms and
necessary austerity in the economic side, and have renounced Concord
on the political side, reopening issues that were resolved. Facing the crisis
economic, response initially was to deny, then try
to hide with borrowings for unproductive expenditures and, finally,
in cuts, improvisation, lack of strategy and horizon. The match
Socialist has lost credibility and the trust of society.
The global and European economic situation is full of uncertainties,
but there are those who are doing well. The crisis does not affect everyone equally.
There are good and bad policies; Governments have managed to cope with
situation. There are better prepared than other countries.

Face a new wave of the crisis with 22 percent unemployment is not
what I do with 10 percent. Nor is it the same thing I do on a
country whose institutions function properly to make one whose
institutions have been subject to severe erosion.
Not the same face a change of economic model with good
I do educational system with a deteriorated, nor is it the same regenerate
the business with an integrated and competitive domestic market, which
do one fractured putting all sorts of obstacles to workers and
entrepreneurs.
Now that the debt crisis enters a new phase, it will not be the same
cope from the situation in which it is Spain after
seven years of bad government to do it from the situation in which
are other European countries. Our task will be more difficult. But the
will.
Spain is at a real crossroads, a historic moment
in which they are deciding the future of several generations. The challenge
ahead as a society is of enormous magnitude. We have
to create jobs and restore stability to our public accounts
return to a path of sustainable growth. We need to regain good
and confidence in government institutions. We have to get our
place in the international arena. And we must act now to convert
crisis into an opportunity.
Spain and other policies need another way of doing politics. The match
Popular offers another form of Spanish rule. Govern from the
center and for all, in moderation and dialogue. Govern with honesty,
responsibility and good judgment. So austere rule, effective and transparent. Rule with truth and credibility.
The Spanish have managed to overcome difficulties in the past. We have known

all. With historical perspective, changing Spain in recent decades
It has been spectacular.
So there are substantial grounds for optimism. Our confidence in the
future comes from the values ​​that so often has reflected the Spanish society:
commitment to freedom, hard work, responsibility, sacrifice, solidarity, respect and high-mindedness. Things have gone well when
we've done together.

instrument for our country to become competitive, create jobs,
generates confidence and ensure the welfare society. We want society to redeploy all its capacities, we want to Spain
best.
Reformism is not improvised. Reformism's responsibility is
anticipation, is moderation, it rigor and prudence. Only a commitment
real reform can fix the real problems. This is the
commitment that the Popular Party has. The reform momentum needs to
self, explicit and must have the support of the majority.
The Spanish know how to do things right, by and for ourselves.
We have shown many times that we can build our future
on solid foundations, which we do a thriving economy, create
employment and work for a cohesive and caring society. The match
People will revitalize Spain's European vocation by agreement
National for Europe, whose center today is the euro, the common project basis,
and it will do what is necessary to regain the path of economic and social modernization.
We must act with determination and consistency, promoting a plan reforms
for the coming years. We are concerned about young people, their future, their education,
their employment opportunities. In a world in which are being produced
deep very quickly, changes have to act thinking about
medium and long term. If we deal decisively now necessary reforms

eleven. Spain, competitive in the euro
DIAGNOSIS
The Spanish economy needs to become more competitive. Shows a serious
external imbalance compounded by the lack of reforms and the lack of
economic and fiscal stability, which are necessary for success in the euro.
Much of our business is still outside
international competition, which undermines the potential for long-term growth and sustainable employment. After the competitive weakness hide multiple factors, such as a small business size,
poor educational model and training, labor market soon
Flexible, an excess of red tape and regulatory shoddy
among others.
As a multiplier of these deficiencies is breaking
market unity by the profusion of divergent regulation scale
regional and local. The regulatory complexity hampers the efficient management
many processes, which discourages domestic and foreign investment
by increased costs, hinders the achievement of economies of
scale and acts as a competitive inhibitor. Spain needs to be
up to the commitments resulting from their membership of the single currency

1.2. The public accounts in order
DIAGNOSIS
Since 2008 the increase in Spanish public debt has exceeded 300,000 million euros, an increase of more than 17,500 euros
per household. The current debt amounts to 700,000 million euros. It's about
an increase unprecedented in our history that has made
Spain lose confidence and international credit. During the last years
Bonanza, the Socialist government has used short-term revenue to increase spending. This has led to much of the deficit
and has entrenched public has become structural.
This imbalance of public accounts hampers growth,
opportunities and employment generation to expensive conditions
Financing for the whole economy. It also diverts credit
available to administrations and puts the country in a situation of extreme vulnerability to further shocks.

GOALS
Sustainability of public finances will collaborate decisively in the strategy for growth and jobs. We foster a fiscal and budgetary policy to act in coordination with the reform agenda

credit rating. Healthy public accounts and public sector
efficient will be the best introduction of the private sector when

Reform programs and management restructuring and liberalization of markets allow the redefinition of areas of public action. We will increase the efficiency of public spending by the
transparency and permanent evaluation of expenditure programs.
Boosting the economy and employment will be achieved through a
deep fiscal reform that seeks greater equity and efficiency by increasing incentives to work, save and invest.
Transparency, austerity and efficiency will be the standard of behavior of administrations. We will strengthen budgetary institutions, mechanisms to control and sanction breaches, and
rules of budgetary stability. Spain will take the lead in Europe as an example of good practice in the budget process and
in ensuring stability. The recent reform of the Constitution provides the framework through which sustainable return to our accounts

bad connection between the Spanish R & D companies, lack of
venture capital, poor oriented enterprises producing goods and
services with high technological content and the still insufficient resources

evident.
The government action in this area has been scattered, incoherent and serious deficiencies in management. They have overlapping activities and
atomized resources, significantly increasing costs of information for businesses and multiplying red tape. The
department aims pursued differ, causing confusion in
businesses and limits the effectiveness of the instruments used. Nonperformance budget reaches unparalleled contributions, highlighting
very serious weaknesses in the programming and use of financial resources
available.

The Spanish property market is too rigid. The housing crisis,
tight credit, unemployment and the slowdown in residential construction

Mass unemployment and the uncertainty associated with household incomes have deteriorated levels of accessibility to home ownership and caused a sharp rise in foreclosures.

DIAGNOSIS
Spain is one of the major fishing powers in the world. Our
fishing industry is in a state of great weakness both by rising costs that it faces as the loss of social relief.
The Spanish fleet is affected also by a reduction in catches
because of the quotas imposed by regional organizations

The low first sale prices are conditioned by the growing
Fish imports from third countries. The Spanish aquaculture production in terms of marine fish, is stagnant
or with a tendency to decline. The difficulties installing
new plants or expanding existing ones have caused the relocation of businesses to neighboring countries around the lack of a
plan of land use and excessive bureaucratization of installation permits.

the crisis but reflects the absence of a coherent industrial policy,
lack of structural reforms, and the breakdown of market unity.
It will impose a flexible, decentralized production, which

Education is one of the main pillars of the proposed reforms
Popular Party. In modern and advanced societies, knowledge
it is the element that determines the possibilities of progress of their citizens and the capabilities of success of a country. The educational reality of Spain
It has been marked by the force of the same model that has shown
unable to prepare our young people for the challenges of societies
the twenty-first century.
International assessments put Spain well below the average of the OECD countries. To this fact is added that 26 percent
of students do not complete their compulsory education and another 28.4 percent
does not continue their studies. According to the PISA report, only 3 percent
Spanish youth reach levels of excellence. In short, the current model has led Spain has a poor education system
quality, which does not promote excellence and do not prepare students
to compete in the knowledge economy. Poor training
hampers personal development, equal opportunities and mobility
social. The figure of 45 percent youth unemployment is partly a result
This reality shows the need to promote deep reforms
in the education system. A new vocational education has to offer
new employment opportunities.
Improving education in Spain is a question that requires policies
well designed. Missing an educational model to improve the acquisition of
knowledge and skills of students. Therefore, measures
presented in this program are designed to ensure greater
academic standards, the recognition of effort and merit, mastery of English at the end of compulsory education and the autonomy of schools
combined with accountability. Just a quality education system will allow real equality of opportunities for each student
reach their fullest potential. Equal opportunities
also requires the development of policies and programs for students with
SEN. Our aim is that no student
is left behind.

The central element to ensure quality education system is the
teachers, whose prestige and authority have been undermined in the model
current. In addition, the adaptation to new realities, to upgrade their
selection and training process with a way of access to the teaching profession
to underline their status as national body.
Therefore, our measures are aimed at strengthening confidence in the authority that comes from knowing. We want more support to teachers and all
-students, families, society and public managers recognize the teacher
the prestige and authority it deserves.
Parents are primarily responsible for the education of their children. By
we need that the educational system has families and trust
in their decisions. Freedom of choice is inseparable from this law.
We are committed to a quality public education and a plurality of offerings of social initiative to respond to the preferences of ideology or pedagogical model families. Respect for
rights of families means that the content of the materials should not
ideologizadores answer projects. Freedom of choice is also free to choose the language of instruction, either Castilian or any of the
official languages. We are convinced that this greater freedom, in addition to addressing a fundamental right, result in quality. Only so
we will have a closer and more accessible to families school.
An adequate supply of places from zero to three years facilitates conciliation.
We consider it a duty of the government to articulate mechanisms
meet this need. In the second cycle of child education, among
3 to 6 years, the education in our country is widespread, what
It offers an excellent opportunity to start learning a language
foreign.
Vocational training must become a powerful tool
for youth employment. Currently, the insufficient number of students opting for vocational training keeps us from Europe. It should
that vocational training is conceived as a path to success. For this it is essential to increase consideration between
students, enhance their role in society, providing it with greater incentives
and orient it towards the employment an effective way. We want training
closely linked to the professional company that combines teacher training center with work within the company and that responds to the demands of the labor market.

One of the greatest assets that our society has to build a modern economy is developed and sustainable higher education. A high quality education also encourages quality
universities. Despite efforts, there remain many aspects by
improving our universities. New funding linked to results and ensure better governance are needed
management and accountability. The teaching profession should be evaluated
transparent and neutral according to parameters that ensure the excellence of teachers.
Research, innovation and transfer are essential elements for developing a competitive and advanced economy. The level achieved in basic research requires aspire to higher levels of excellence. Universities have to be genuine knowledge factories
for Spanish society. This requires enhancing mobility,
internationalization and evaluation of results.
The Popular Party in this curriculum reforms needed to
achieve a quality education system that allows the Spanish take advantage of opportunities generated by the knowledge economy.

21. Quality education for all
DIAGNOSIS
The Spanish education system suspended for lack of excellence. Indices
failure (26 percent) and school leavers (28.4 percent) Tolls
the European Union (14.4 percent). This is the balance model
socialist educational force for over two decades. It has very negative consequences for the economic growth of our country;
more than half of young people leaving school with a very low
training and poor knowledge of languages. When the mode is evaluated
our educational system which transmits knowledge to students
of core subjects such as language, mathematics and science
were, year after year, far from the best.
In addition, the authority is not respected teacher and model selection and training must be updated.

GOALS

personal development and school success: effort, the pursuit of
excellence, entrepreneurship, self-demanding, accountability,
tolerance, and a sense of duty to others and to society.
We are committed to the purpose of the European Union for 2020
reduce the dropout rate to 10 percent. We propose that
all students complete their compulsory education with knowledge
of at least one foreign language.

83
82

In the coming years we will see a significant generational renewal
teacher. We must attract and select the best for the profession. The teacher's role is key to the success of the education system. There are
to return to the teacher at the center of educational life.
Improving education requires promoting transparency and accountability
accounts centers. We will increase the skills of teams
managers favoring professionalization of management and management
centers, so that they can address the challenges with greater capacities
resulting in greater organizational autonomy. We will support especially
centers that enroll students in social disadvantage,
promoting specific initiatives to strengthen the academic and
culture of these students. We will promote the improvement of educational services
diversity for students with educational needs.
We are convinced that systems respond with greater autonomy
better to the demands of the families, strengthen institutional accountability, promote greater involvement of principals, teachers and
families and, ultimately, achieve better results. We will ensure the
freedom of choice driving a quality public education and
social education initiative whose autonomy must be respected.
Reinforce educational task as the transmission of our common cultural heritage and core values ​​that shape the way of life
our Western civilization, avoiding indoctrinating content. We will guarantee the right to use the Spanish and the other official languages
as vehicular languages.
Modernize the scholarship system to recognize the effort and excellence, and facilitate mobility. We will promote the spread of education

DIAGNOSIS
At present, the rate of youth unemployment in Spain is the highest in the
EU reaches 44 percent and is 23 points above the
average. More than half of young people leaving the education system with a
precarious training and who either do not complete their studies
mandatory or if they do, they have no extra training.
The labor market in Spain of young graduates in vocational training is still much higher, even in this period of crisis, that of the
Young people who have just obtained the qualification of compulsory secondary. Without
But the number of graduates of vocational training is scarce. Between
the reasons for this is the lack of social prestige, lack of development of the legislative framework and lack of coordination between initial training and vocational training for employment, management and preventing

2. 3. Universities of excellence
DIAGNOSIS
None of the Spanish universities listed among the top 150
worldwide. Their quality should be improved to keep up what
a modern and advanced society requires. We need universities that encourage excellence and provide incentives to effort from the
earliest stages of education.
Financing models and government are not adapted to the new
challenges and are at the origin of this situation. In addition, the teacher selection system has many deficiencies,
It reflected in the low incorporation of our teachers abroad
universities. There is a very low student mobility, slowing down the
competition between universities.
Furthermore, although there is a remarkable scientific production has not developed a policy that favors the transfer of results
nor it has stimulated research rapprochement between universities
and the company.

2.4. New frontiers for science and knowledge
DIAGNOSIS
Despite the breakthrough achieved in scientific production levels
over recent decades, Spain is one of the developed countries
less transfer capacity and enhancement of the results
research.
The growth of the Spanish system of science and technology relies on a
intense use of public resources. Spain Being far from the levels of investment in R & D of advanced countries is, however, one
of which more public resources used in relative terms. This lack
private investment, in large part, is due to inadequate communication between the public research agents (universities and OPIS,
singularly) and businesses.
Our public schools generate much scientific output but are
still far from achieving desirable levels of excellence. Older
levels of international visibility and reputation are getting precisely in the semi-public area, where new forms of organization and
management, less bureaucratic, attractive to researchers most talented and open society, are reaching remarkable heights of success.
The scattered actions of the different administrations is due to many
inefficiencies. The new law of science, technology and innovation offers
new opportunities to improve coordination between administrations
and opens new possibilities of transforming the Spanish R + D
we will have to develop fully.

GOALS
We will promote research aimed at solving innovative
problems that society is facing expansion, and promote
of knowledge. We will increase the quality and relevance of research funded with public resources, improving their social profitability.

Formulate a genuine joint programming of public expenditure in
R & D of all administrations, creating the critical mass for
reaching international impact, reducing inefficiencies arising
dispersion and duplication. Harmonize and enforce
the exchange of information systems, monitoring and evaluation
results.
We will encourage private investment in R & D to increase competitiveness
of our production and the number of jobs in sectors half
and high technology. Spain will work to attract the best international talent.
We will strengthen the public system of biomedical research, with a strategy that prioritizes the most prevalent diseases, increase cooperation
international, coordinate all government efforts and accelerate the translation

3.1. The family: first welfare state
DIAGNOSIS
The family is a fundamental element of our society that gives stability and solidity to personal relationships. It is an expression of solidarity
and it contributes to the welfare of people. Family support is the best
investment in the difficult times we are living.
Raising a family today requires great efforts. The number of children per family remains one of the lowest in the world (1.38)
and the age at which women have children of the highest (31.2). In
households with disabled children, one in ten, the situation is complicated
extra.
Many families are struggling. More than 1.3 million households have
all members unemployed and half a million do not have any income. The level of household debt is much higher than in other
European homes and their financial situation is very worrying: since
the crisis began have run more than 300,000 mortgages.
Families with children deserve special attention. Who decides to have
children have a responsibility and obligations which can not be
subtract. But society has a responsibility to the families to help their children grow into independent and responsible people.

Families are an essential support of society, especially in times
crisis, and we will support them as they deserve, especially those with children

territory in which they live.
The employment strategy for the disabled which was adopted in 2008 has not
provided jobs. Nor it has projected a true strategy of integration at all levels. The training offer is not adapted

3.6. Integration: same rights, same obligations
DIAGNOSIS
The most significant fact of immigration in our country is its exceptional integration. In the last decade, Spain became the first destination of immigration in the European Union have joined our
population over five million immigrants, twelve percent of
total population. Immigrants have rejuvenated our population
and contributed to the most important period of economic prosperity
this new century.
The work, effort and social mobility are often they embody values ​​immigrants. Indispensable partners of the moments of
boom, have been rigorously crisis. The unemployment rate of foreigners
He rose from seven percent in 2004 to thirty two percent in 2011.
Thousands are losing their green cards for not being able to renew
Because of unemployment, as it has been called supervening illegality.

New times require new immigration policies. Build a
more productive economy requires a skilled immigration and people-especially young man speeding on the recognition of qualifications
of those who are already here. Nationality has become point
arrival itinerary of many immigrants in Spain and requires design
formulas to convey what it means to be Spanish citizens.

We will favor the employability of foreigners who have been
on the dole.

when there is not, they can accumulate their periods of temporary work
purposes of calculating residence, guaranteeing work permit
in every season.
Schooling is one of the best forms of integration. We will fight the high school failure of foreign minors. Inside

In the globalized world the quality of our legal system and the
effectiveness of our institutions are a powerful factor in competitiveness
vertebral and should be part of our economic growth strategy.
Euro membership means taking no lasting challenges that compromise
only one particular government but all that can happen; do not
only politicians but the whole of Spanish society leaders. The
public authorities are bound by those commitments, and must
take as their own permanent habits of transparency, austerity and
responsibility.
The recovery goes through further modernization of Spain, a transformation that appraise all our capacities, to mobilize all resources, to put Spain up. Modernizing means achieving
that the sacrifice is already making Spanish society is really
useful guide means shared effort toward goals that guarantee
better future, means that Spain again fully operational.
That great modernizing project can only lead a reformist government.
This modernization effort should have a particular impact on the sector
public. The quality of the organization and management of administrations largely determines the quality and efficiency of the economic system
and social. A stark and focused administrations in providing
services to society, quality standards commensurate with the level of
wealth of the country, are a factor of efficiency, productivity and improved

In the administration of public resources austerity, transparency
and responsibility must be the guiding principles of all reforms.
When millions of Spaniards have lost their jobs and the vast majority
It has been severely affected its economic situation, administrations
must be a constant example of restraint and rigor in the use of all taxes. All administrations must be, from beginning to end,
at the service of citizens. The road bypasses to improvised responses ineffective and unfair. It is strictly necessary to address reforms
most profound in the way of spending and eliminate the waste.
The transformation that is now facing administrations should
pursue three clear objectives: a more efficient provision of services
public, more efficient private sector participation in the provision
thereof and improved accountability supported in full
transparency. The reform is imperative, not only for the urgent containment of unnecessary expense but, above all, to contribute to a
improving the competitiveness of the Spanish economy, ensure equity
intergenerational and win in the legitimacy of our democratic system.
An unbiased and quality public service is an essential element
for the proper functioning of a modern state. A new human resources policy, modern, based on professionalism is necessary and
on the principles of merit and ability. There are too many public offices and
temporary staff. The growing deskilling of administration
It is closely linked with the proliferation of unnecessary expenses and
the arbitrary exercise of public functions.
Allocate public resources to the real priorities is a
even more urgent in a situation like the current budget crisis democratic requirement. The reform of our system of budgeting, implementation and control of expenditure is inevitable and must be accompanied by
effective systems for measuring results obtained with the resources
employees. Not enough budget better, we must speak clearly
the effectiveness of spending and accountability for the use given to the money
of all. The response to each management failure can not always be
an increase in the money allocated to the same objectives without some variation in the instruments used to achieve them.

143
142

It's time to promote a change of perspective, to place the citizen as the axis around which to articulate all the services and
procedures that could affect you. It is imperative to offer each citizen a personalized, consistent and integrated set information
their relations with public administrations; a true one-stop electronics. To achieve this it is necessary to rethink rigorously
administrative structures providing support internally
computer Services.
Progress in the implementation of a true e-government
still it offers a wealth of new opportunities, both for the possibility of offering a better service to citizens and for the opportunity
to obtain significant reductions in public spending. Administrations
They suffer from internal fragmentation of computing resources that multiplies costs. State's own administration appears completely different electronic personalities to the citizen. Some
everyday and seemingly simple activities require multiplying a
endless notifications to as many agencies.
A modern state must guarantee values ​​of certainty, legal certainty and legitimate expectations. Some principles must be fully accepted into the regulatory activity: predictability in the objectives and horizons
temporary, clearly defined responsibilities, reduced discretion,
transparency in decision-making processes, transparent regulatory dialogue
between authorities and stakeholders, flexibility, agility, minimal intervention and full respect for market mechanisms. We need clear, precise, stable and easily enforceable rules, whatever their
origin. The steady growth of administrations, multiplication
standards, and lack of rigor in its preparation are becoming our
law in a web that entangles and harms both individual liberties and the efficiency of our economic system.
All reforms must be applied to all administrations
existing in Spain. Decentralization is a powerful tool
approach the centers of political decision citizens, but only
properly articulated can be efficient. Reap the benefits
encloses the political and administrative decentralization demands seriously address many problems that have so far been ignored.

It is urgent to define precisely the powers of the various authorities to avoid duplication, waste of all kinds and, what is
even worse, neglect or delay in the provision of basic needs
the citizens. It must remedy the improper provision of services
by expressly conferred powers and funding and,
appropriate, effective and consistent penalty ban. It is imperative to articulate effective mechanisms for exchanging information to enable
contrast the public of the effectiveness of the various administrations in the
provision of services. Only then can obtain the benefits that
experimentation and learning can occur in a decentralized system. Public knowledge of comparative indicators able to measure the efficiency in administrations is an unavoidable political necessity.

DIAGNOSIS
Transparency is a prerequisite for good management of resources to ensure the most honest behavior

Transparency means easy access to all relevant information in a clear and understandable way. Being transparent is imperative to win and
maintain the confidence of the Spaniards in their institutions. Spain is one
of the few European countries that does not have a law on transparency and citizen access to public information. During the last years
have been adopted partial and disconnected measures, absolutely insufficient to meet the Spanish demand levels and that our

Given the quantitative and qualitative importance of the activity of the sector
public and induced by this, the country can not be competitive and productive while their public administrations are not.
The crisis has exposed the weakness of our instruments of internal and external control. The emergence of hidden deficits in some communities
autonomous and local authorities should lead us to change systems

DIAGNOSIS
Spain has undergone tremendous change over the past three decades to which the public sector has not remained oblivious. A notable
economic transformation linked to the deployment of the welfare state, the
European integration and development of the Autonomous State have changed
radically the environment in which public activity takes place. Our governments have not kept pace with the necessary changes
to ensure efficiency and good service to citizens. A real reform of public administration remains a pending task
which it is already urgent.
The general state administration has been adapting to the new distribution of powers arising from the autonomous model, but has not made
a comprehensive reorganization of its resources adjusted to their new profile.
Those ministries that have transferred much of their skills
the regions have not fully completed the adaptation
their structures to new functions to be performed.
the time has come to be consistent with the changes experienced and
build a new management model.

DIAGNOSIS
For over three decades, the Spanish Constitution and the rule of
autonomies have been referring to freedom, progress and ensuring the rights and freedoms of all Spaniards. Undeniably absolute
effectiveness and validity of the rule of autonomy as the backbone of
coexistence and progress of the Spaniards, but you can not ignore the
existence of operational problems that must be solved.
Speaking of the regions is talk of welfare services. Their funding problems, their lack of management and lack of
coordination between all of them are directly affecting the sustainability of essential public services.
Inadequate implementation of the funding model, with advances have
provided that during years of bonanza cyclical structural expenditure were consolidated, it has reduced flexibility to the adjustability of the autonomous communities in times of crisis.
There is significant in the development of relations of horizontal cooperation among the different autonomous communities deficit. They have failed

democracy

The democratic system is based on the performance of public authorities to set legal standards and institutions as defined in that
public powers are deposited. The proper functioning of the
institutions depends on the vigor of democratic life, the strength and credibility of the commitment that links representatives and represented.
The capacity of the state to protect the rights of citizens and the
effective balanced distribution of power also depend on that good
functioning of the institutions.
Strengthening the institutional framework is a continuing need
for active democratic system. For Spain it is also a requirement
indispensable in the task of civic recovery. A major effort for dialogue and reform is needed to provide durable solutions to the
requirements of an advanced democratic society. A society with a
increasing diversity in which no one should be excluded or feel, in which
everyone enjoys the same rights and duties with full respect for the
Constitution and the laws. Cultural, religious and linguistic diversity demands
a reinforcement of common democratic institutions and ensuring the
individual rights and freedoms.
The Popular Party extends to all areas of its program objective
regeneration that will also answer all of your action

For the PP regeneration it means focus policy on the
real concerns of citizens during this period

The result is evident. It never registered such a high degree of
distrust of politics; It has never been greater skepticism
citizens against their rulers. The policy should be part of the solution, not the problem. The Popular Party has never been easier when inheritance has assumed responsibilities of government. He has never shied
their responsibilities difficult the situations that had
to face. Now neither will.
We believe in politics and commitment. The Popular Party wants to capture
This commitment to the future of Spain in the proposed project
shared social and economic progress. The discourses that disqualify
global politics and politicians without offering alternative enclose a
grave danger. This is to strengthen democratic institutions and not to deny its legitimacy; It is about improving the processes of deliberation and agreement, not to supplant them.
We must begin a new stage of strengthening institutions
put an end to the years of loss of sense of State, partisan appropriation of powers and policies of exclusion.
We need to strengthen democratic institutions to restore the fabric of confidence without which no society can cope with tests
as today urges overcome. The Spaniards can and must overcome
these tests.
Corruption is a serious disease of democracy. The determined struggle
corruption will be a priority effort with a clear legislative and institutional reflection. The exemplary and transparency should govern the
actions of anyone who assumes public responsibilities, in two dimensions, personal and institutional. The Popular Party is committed to promoting transparency, austerity and rigor, and to fight against corruption in both the political leadership and the overall performance
government.
The legal and institutional system is crucial to the economic performance of a country. A contradictory and excessive legal system dependent on arbitrary legislative impulses is an insurmountable burden for
credit society. We need a predictable legal framework,
effective rules applied by institutions and bodies to guarantee qualification and transparency. An environment of stability and confidence makes possible the best initiatives and the most creditworthy projects. The Popular Party
strongly agrees with this key challenge for modernization and
the competitiveness of our country.

171

Often it has been debated whether the problems observed in our
institutional framework are due to deficiencies in its legal structure or arising from the bankruptcy of the basic political agreements on which it sits.
The reality shows that the breakdown of basic political consensus has
led to changes in the configuration and operation of key components of our institutional framework, as the Court
Constitutional or the General Council of the Judiciary, which have been
seriously detrimental to its proper operation.
We must reassess the meaning of the Constitution as a result of the great
political and reconciliation between Spaniards pact. In that agreement, and in
the framework that defines and guarantees the Constitution, the Spanish have achieved our greatest successes. Although the clauses of the constitutional rule can be modified, principles and values ​​it incorporates must
unite the efforts of all, add capacity and implement
civic virtues that ensure our future.

by breaking the basic agreements that support them. Institutions
by articulating backbone and which they have been used to divide and confront. The
They presented themselves as champions of the public, once again,
They have led to political and public'm institutions par excellence to raise the current level of distrust and disrepute. From patrimonialization
It born of political irresponsibility and the postponement of interest

Citizens have not been out of politics. It is government policy
Socialist which he has moved away from them. They have turned politics into an end

The policy does not belong to the politicians but of citizens.

GOALS
Spain must recover the strength and credit institutions. If the
crisis we are facing is a crisis of confidence, this objective can not

Austerity, transparency and exemplary be the way to restore

The fight against corruption is one of the main objectives of the Party
Popular as the functioning of the democratic system should not be

given the gravity of certain behaviors.
Recover confidence in Parliament as a hub of political life and
of democratic deliberation. We promise to substantially improve the procedures of deliberation and public debate own a
representative democracy. Deliberation, reflection on our common problems and how best to address them requires operation
at full capacity of representative institutions and the responsibility of all those involved in shaping public opinion. Strengthen the bond between representatives represented.
Because politics does not stand on its own. You need to be encouraged by
a society that recognizes it.
We will restore confidence in the independence of judges and courts and

5.2. Agile and predictable justice
DIAGNOSIS
Justice is a state power, the ultimate guarantee of the rights and freedoms of citizens. Congestion of the courts, the
delay in lawsuits and the delays and incidents in the execution of the
Judgments are the outward manifestation of deficiencies
accumulated in the Spanish justice to be addressed with determination.
The effective protection of the rights and interests of citizens depends the credibility of the institutional framework and the implementation of legal certainty. Justice also is an essential factor in competitiveness
and also why their improvement is a priority.
Legislative production has declined in quality, affecting legal certainty and the proper role of a judge. The plurality of own systems
the territorial structure of the State must be integrated into a cohesive system by the Constitution and laws of development as well as by doctrine
the Supreme Court as the highest court.
It is necessary to improve the efficiency of our judicial system. The technological gap between the administration of justice of other major
areas of governance is not acceptable and offers great opportunities
gets better.
The growing criminalization of the sanction system and materials
economic-social order represents an addition to the administration of justice in matters burden on its intervention is not always
justified.

5.5. The defeat of terrorism
DIAGNOSIS
Terrorism has been the most persistent and cruel attack on Spanish society, the rule of law and coexistence in freedom. The Spaniards know that terrorism can be defeated. Combating terrorism will require further develop state policies do even closer
international cooperation and reaffirm the strength of the rule of law.
Victims of terrorism are creditors of our gratitude and
support for. They have been the moral and civic mirror in which Spanish society
He looked to know the reality of their suffering inhuman and react against the radical injustice of the violence they have suffered. Ensure
the right of victims to dignity, memory, and repair
through justice and the recognition and closeness they deserve.
They have been and will remain an important benchmark for all Spaniards before the
challenge of terrorist violence.
The announcement of "definitive cessation of its armed activity" by ETA
is, in any case, recognizing their defeat. But we must remember that the mere existence of the terrorist group, which has not announced its dissolution and disarmament is intimidating and threatening. Is now
must reiterate that it is not acceptable to pay any political price for
kill, nor can it be assumed that revenues obtained by quitting.
At the same time we have to keep acting without reservation the rule of law against terrorism of ETA and its leaders, we will prevent the legitimization of his career, the glorification of terrorists,
equating the victims with criminals and the return to the use
a supposed historical conflict between Basques and Spaniards to justify
violence, impunity demand and initiate a process of imposition and rupture,
disguised political negotiation.

the undoubted progress made, instability persists in many
places of the world. The risk level has not been reduced. The transformation
terrorist organizations that sign, its extension to North Africa and pockets of radicalization continue to feed these organizations.

GOALS
Our first objective is the attainment by all citizens enjoy
their rights, free of terrorist violence or its threat. It is precisely the
record in a sustained struggle. Firmness is required in our commitment to the rule of law and means to prevent terrorism
and policy instruments circumvent the requirements of the law. We will not accept
link any legal and political change with the strategy of a terrorist group.
The key to the complete disappearance of ETA is in agreement with the Democrats, in the strength of the rule of law, supporting and memory
victims, and recognition and repair the damage. The
Democracy can only take a final with impunity; an end that do not open
the door to the legitimacy of terrorist violence but requires the recognition of the damage done.
The extent of the defeat of ETA should be the dignity and memory
their victims. They represent a huge sacrifice to keep democracy and freedom. They have renounced vengeance for justice and trust,
thus, they offered an example of inestimable value.
We will seek the strongest and stable agreement to enhance the counter-terrorism strategy with the commitment of the irreversible disappearance of ETA
As an organization, the dismantling of their structures and delivery
of weapons.

the necessary measures to prevent the use of the institutions in any activity support, legitimation or justification of terrorism and its

Solidarity is an outstanding value of Spanish society. We have done our terrible needs of many countries and the attempt to alleviate them is one of the features of the most we can be proud as
country. We face the challenge of conducting a modern cooperation,
effectively and with a real impact on the companies to which it applies.
Since 2000 the Millennium Development Goals express the global consensus
on cooperation. Spain can not afford development aid without
assessments of actual and set off the foreign policy impact.
The Popular Party considers development cooperation both a challenge
morality as a technical and political challenges. A modern development cooperation should involve the whole society, its universities, institutions, foundations and NGOs. In the framework of cooperation
development believe that the greatest challenge lies in boosting the
tools that will support the reduction and eradication of poverty

cyber attacks, proliferation, energy shortages or
failed states pose threats to our security.
We have lacked a stable policy on security and defense,
and he has lacked consistency in security doctrine. The needs and
Spain international commitments require sound planning
strategy of our military capabilities.
Today there are more Spanish soldiers deployed overseas than ever
