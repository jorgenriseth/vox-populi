Very pleased after many months of negotiation and hard work from all involved to have secured extra flights to Falklands. Really appreciate @ArgentinaMFA constructive approach. It is to everyone’s benefit to have better links between Falklands and Latin America. (@FalklandsGov)https://twitter.com/FalklandsGov/status/1147157325138075648 …
