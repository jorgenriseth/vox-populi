Brilliant to welcome the fantastic Year 6 class from Hallbrook Primary School to Parliament last week - the class came prepared with some great (& tricky) questions from pupils & I hope they enjoyed their tour. Look forward to visiting Hallbrook in Broughton later this monthpic.twitter.com/ERdeDoBGm3
