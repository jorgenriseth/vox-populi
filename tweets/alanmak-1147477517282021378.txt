Great to present a Union Flag to some of the congregation at the #HaylingIsland Christian Centre for use in the Hall and at events! 

Any #Havant Constituency resident who would like a free Union Flag or St. George's Flag should contact me online: http://www.AlanMak.org.uk/FlagÂ pic.twitter.com/zscHpdQIgD
