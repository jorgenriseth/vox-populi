On #ArmedForcesDay the nation says thank you to the Armed Forces. Here, @PennyMordaunt, the Secretary of State for Defence, talks to paratroopers from @Airbornegunners especially poignant as she is herself the daughter of a paratrooper. #OneArmy #UtrinqueParatuspic.twitter.com/m3HemidedK

Dear @Arron_banks - a brave woman (with whom I disagree on much) speaks from the heart and speaks up for love, compassion and understanding and against prejudice and hate - and you reply like this... please reflect and apologisehttps://twitter.com/Arron_banks/status/1143612421157851137 …
I’m sure Caroline and the Guardian wouldn’t want to mislead people so let’s be absolutely clear: 

HMRC has had to do this in order to comply with EU VAT rules following an ECJ ruling in 2015.

Just brilliant to see the UK's new net zero target pass the Commons tonight without a single vote against. A tremendous result for @SimonClarkeMP, @AlexChalkChelt and all the other brilliant @CEN_HQ MPs. Great work by the Government; a big win for the UK and the climate.
We did it. The 10k legal walk raised approaching £1 million for legal charities; thanks to the fine team from the AGO who kept the SG and me going!pic.twitter.com/WozQBaD1NH
Total rubbish. The runway in question is in St Helena. I was the DFID Minister who built it - completed early, under budget, and despite difficult wind conditions it operates well. It fulfils our legal obligations to a UK overseas territory and so is not "foreign aid".https://twitter.com/LBC/status/1138748219826028547 …
Net zero emissions by 2050.

Let’s do it.

Fantastic news. Net zero by 2050 is a bold target, but vital if runaway warming is to be stopped. It will help spur UK tech and innovation too.https://twitter.com/SkyNewsBreak/status/1138551588266680325 …
In today’s @timesredbox, @AlexChalkChelt and I argue @theresa_may can leave a powerful legacy through embracing #netzero and the excellent report by @theCCCuk.  One of the most pressing challenges - and greatest opportunities - of our time.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/theresa-may-should-look-to-climate-change-for-a-positive-legacy-hgsfbwbxx …
Superb piece on climate change #NetZero from @SimonClarkeMP & @AlexChalkChelt in The Times this morning.https://twitter.com/SimonClarkeMP/status/1137982481880223744 …
I think this is the wrong priority.https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1137821375606022144 …
Thank you @alexchalkchelt for supporting #GenerationSea and doing your bit to protect the oceanhttps://www.sas.org.uk/TellYourMP 
#ICYMI: Defence Secretary @PennyMordaunt announced yesterday that all serving personnel in our military will earn a Living Wage.

"No solider, sailor, airman or woman should be asked to serve our country and not be sufficiently rewarded."

Pine Class wrote to @AlexChalkChelt about banning single use plastics in Cheltenham. Today they received replies thanking them for their excellent letters and agreeing about how important this is.pic.twitter.com/0diCwgpzbW
This is the most coherent proposal I’ve seen so far from a leadership candidate.https://twitter.com/MattHancock/status/1135083869257064449 …
Am exceptionally dignified speech by a PM who came into politics for all the right reasons
