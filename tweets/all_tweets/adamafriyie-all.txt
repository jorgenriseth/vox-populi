Thanks to Nigel & Suzanne Kneighton for hosting a fabulous garden party in Datchet for Windsor Conservatives, with special guest Kwasi Kwarteng. It was Boris for PM all round.  @WindsorTories @Conservatives @KwasiKwarteng @BorisJohnson @BackBoris
Delighted to support the British Bangladeshi Catering Association & it’s energetic President Councillor Shelim or the Royal Borough @thebbca @BCA1960 @RBWMpic.twitter.com/AVn4nz1YGP
Good news for Party and country. If Boris and Conservatives can deliver Brexit then we can focus on working together to build a more united and outward-looking nation @Conservatives @BorisJohnson @BackBorispic.twitter.com/ZRw561a4ES
It seems to me that we need a clean break from the EU on 31st October to end the uncertainty & national angst being played out. We can then work together to look outward & rebuild our national self-confidence on the international stage @Conservatives @BackBorispic.twitter.com/6NYpE05FUZ
Dominic Raab was electrifying and well received this evening at our Windsor Patrons Club supper. Huge thanks, and huge thanks to members and guests for a great evening. @WindsorTories @Conservatives @DominicRaab
Huge thanks to Hogan Lovells & the Economic Sec to the Treasury, John Glen, for his input at our Fintech APPG lunch. The UK Fintech regulatory & tax environment is great today-must ensure we remain No. 1 in the future @APPGFinTech @InnFin @JohnGlenUK @hmtreasury @HoganLovells
Uplifting meeting with Minister for Africa, Harriet Baldwin & DIT Minister, Graham Stuart, this morning. Planning for the UK Africa Investment summit in Jan 2020. Lots or mutual trade & dev opportunities for Ghana, Guinea, Africa & UK  @hbaldwin @grahamstuart @tradegovuk @DFID_UK
This is what my children were singing whenever I mentioned Rory. Nobody will forget your refreshing campaign & I hope you’ll remain in Gov. Working with you as PM’s Trade Envoy to Ghana, when you were Minister for Africa, was a privilege  @RoryStewartUKhttps://youtu.be/53fopOEwW_I 
This new target has made my day. The UK leads the world again on environmental issues. We must use our influence and example to nudge the EU and others in the same direction @Conservatives #NetZerohttps://twitter.com/10DowningStreet/status/1138714991618600960 …
Delighted to meet the enthusiastic @hannah__needham today to talk about bio diversity in Datchet, the environment bill & green bridges! I’m certainly wild about #WildAboutDatchet! @BBOWT @WildlifeTrusts #WilderFuture @RBWM #EnvironmentBill #NatureRecoveryNetworks @CEN_HQ
A dignified resignation speech from our Prime Minister. I thank her for her tireless efforts as Prime Minister and, in particular, for consistently investing and reforming mental health services. @Conservatives @Theresa_May @10DowningStreet
My friend Dan Hannan has been fighting tooth and nail for a swift & clean Brexit. He’s the first candidate on the Conservative South East list: please support him & all those candidates who want to implement the people’s vote of 2016 @danieljhannan @Conservatives
It has been, and continues to be, a great pleasure to work with both of you over many years. You’ve achieved a great deal for our residents & long may it continue @farmerrayner @samanthajrayner @rbwmhttps://twitter.com/samanthajrayner/status/1131103590276321280 …
A privilege to attend the Household Cavalry Freedom Parade today with their HRH Colonel Princess Anne commanding the troop. They will always be welcome in Windsor! #FreedomParade @HCav1660 @RBWMpic.twitter.com/Q0ODqUfRq5
This really is a UK environmental first. No coal burned for power for a 139 hours! Well beyond what I’d initially envisaged at this stage. No wonder we’re ahead of our CO2 emissions targets. More to do but a great moment in our history.  @Conservatives @beisgovukhttps://twitter.com/UK_Coal/status/1125672136088145920 …
A truly insightful breakfast meeting with Lord Holmes & fintech companies looking into digital identity & inclusion. Uk is in a good place but more to do to accelerate spreading the benefits of easy online ID for citizens & consumers @LordCHolmes @APPGFinTech @MastercardUK
Saddened to lose some excellent local Councillors in the Royal Borough (I know how hard they worked to give residents low council tax with excellent services), but pleased Conservatives won overall so we can continue to put people first in our area. @Conservatives @WindsorTories
I hope that residents of Datchet, Horton & Wraysbury will elect hard-working Conservatives today because the trio of @davidpcannon, @rushimillns & @GaryMuir18 will keep council tax low & service quality high locally @WindsorTories @Conservatives
Have just cast my vote with enthusiasm for the magnificent Arlene Carson & Amit Verma in Old Windsor. To keep your council tax low and service quality high locally I’d urge you to do the same before 10pm! @ArleneCarson4OW @WindsorTories @Conservatives
Let’s help keep Binfield with Warfield Bracknell Conservative today by electing John Harrison, Ian Leake & @AnkurSBhandari so residents retain lower council tax & higher quality services. They’re fighting tooth & nail for local residents @WindsorTories @Conservatives
