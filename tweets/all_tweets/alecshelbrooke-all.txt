As a Conservative & Unionist MP I believe all four corners of the U.K. should be aligned on rights. That's why I voted to equalise same-sex civil marriage in Northern Ireland. And because #LoveIsLove.https://twitter.com/rsaltleeds/status/1148278782207434756 …
After a busy morning of community events I’m out talking to residents on the doorstep this afternoon, picking up local issues and solving local problems where I can.pic.twitter.com/awb30kUzK3
As a local independent councillor I do feel we are extremely well placed as we are able to work with our MP in a completely non-partisan manner for the benefit of the community. Often party politics gets in the way of simple, sensible representation on the ground. 1 of 2https://twitter.com/alecshelbrooke/status/1147096794406543362 …

Heartbreaking to read how an elderly man needlessly died after he was sent to a private clinic(which charged his family $200,000) after falling ill on a cruise ship. MP @AlecShelbrooke raised it at PMQs to save others. These are the distressing details: https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2019-06-20/debates/5FE1E8E0-05DF-4A26-A5C9-9A8BA1E0543F/PortAgentsMedicalDutyOfCare …

The entire format of last night's debate was specifically designed to give viewers the impression the questions were being asked by ordinary, non-partisan members of the public. And we now know that was a fabrication. It was a deception, and one the BBC knew was a deception.
That's why it's getting 20 Billion through this governmenthttps://twitter.com/huns62/status/1140993521542975488 …
