Sir Kim Darroch is an extraordinary public servant and capable diplomat of the highest integrity. His premature departure is not in anyone’s interests and it is regrettable that unjustified attacks on him have brought this about. @KimDarroch @UKinUSA
Am severely disappointed that Boris Johnson appears unwilling to stand up for our Ambassador to the US, our PM or our country. What does that tell you? Utter wimp when the crunch comes when he should be making a stand. Err... next PM??? #ITVDebate #HastobeHunt
1/2 @realDonaldTrump friends speak frankly so I will: these comments are disrespectful and wrong to our Prime Minister and my country. Your diplomats give their private opinions to @SecPompeo and so do ours! You said the UK/US alliance was the greatest in history and I agree...https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1148559443845668864 …
2/2...but allies need to treat each other with respect as @theresa_may has always done with you. Ambassadors are appointed by the UK government and if I become PM our Ambassador stays.
My closing remarks at today’s debate in Parliament on recent leaks: 
1) good to see resounding cross-party support on this issue
2) full confidence in HMA Washington
3) strong relationship between the US and UK will endure forever @UKinUSA @USAinUK

The government "utterly deplores" the leaking of classified emails from Britain's ambassador to the US, says minister Sir Alan Duncan – adding that diplomats are "paid to be candid"

"We will not be leaving the Western Balkans behind. We’ll continue to play our part in what I hope will be an ever better future for them."

Very pleased after many months of negotiation and hard work from all involved to have secured extra flights to Falklands. Really appreciate @ArgentinaMFA constructive approach. It is to everyone’s benefit to have better links between Falklands and Latin America. (@FalklandsGov)https://twitter.com/FalklandsGov/status/1147157325138075648 …

Pleasure to host the Missing Persons Group @BerlinProcess in #Poznań with @TheICMP. Important that the #WesternBalkans region works together to help find the approx. 12,000 people missing from the 1990s conflicts. UK is proud to support through #UKCSSF funding.pic.twitter.com/5uUoRcQkau
Great to be here in #Poznań  for @BerlinProcess Summit. Brings back good memories of the 2018 #WBSummitLondon. Looking forward to more discussions with good friends from #WesternBalkans and the EU as we focus on the region’s potential.pic.twitter.com/7NymYG402j
Ah, ok Mr Johnson. So leaving with No Deal would be an emergency!?!? Mmmm. Please marry that up with one of your two promised outcomes for October. #HasToBeHunthttps://twitter.com/steven_swinford/status/1144362134098317313 …
This encouraging poll is proof the public value honesty and integrity. @Jeremy_Hunt’s vision for Britain is resonating with voters. #HastobeHunthttps://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/06/28/jeremy-hunt-now-leads-boris-johnson-publics-prefer …
Very good to meet with constituents today to talk about climate change as part of #TheTimeIsNow campaign. Proud that the UK will lead the way as the first major economy to legislate for #NetZero emissions. @TheCCoalitionpic.twitter.com/JsayEQfq1f
It is impossible not to conclude that Boris Johnson is just saying anything to win votes - regardless of whether or not he knows it to be true. His entire platform is a UXB. #HastobeHunt
Another good day for @Jeremy_Hunt after Scotland yesterday. Full media round and visit to #Bristol. Meanwhile Mr Johnson is nowhere to be seen - come out of hiding and be prepared to debate the issues! #hastobehuntpic.twitter.com/L9Fj9hANnE
Thanks to @KosovoinUK for tonight’s event, commemorating those who suffered, fought and died to secure peace in Kosovo - the UK supports Kosovo and reconciliation.pic.twitter.com/cKg7PkOiqr
Thrilled and delighted that @Jeremy_Hunt has made it through to the “final”. If one week is a long time in politics, four is an eternity. Next PM, I hope. He can do it! #hastobehunt
It was a real privilege for me to bring Alan Mould, my headmaster of 50 years ago at Beechwood Park School @BWPSchool to #PMQs. Inspiring, legendary…all superlatives of praise apply to this wonderful man - who is now nearly 90! He brought an old school photo of me.pic.twitter.com/jq10yKgMli
Great visit of Colombian President @IvanDuque. Co-operation across whole of government shown by seven UK Ministers at dinner last night with their counterparts. UK fully supporting peace, environment and regional security.pic.twitter.com/G1d5ca9d5G
